(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why you should buy the 493 other S&amp;P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\nNews Content: Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly addressing the perception of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer finds this view inflammatory, he also acknowledges the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context, especially regarding AI and iPhone sales. The overall sentiment appears to be cautious, with some positive notes about broader market performance but concerns about innovation and competition. Given the mixed signals and the current market environment, the probabilities of stock price movement are balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to Cramer's positive remarks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the potential exit of Goldman Sachs from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial services offerings. This could negatively impact user experience and loyalty, at least in the short term. The reliance on Goldman for backend support means a partner swap could be complex and potentially costly. On the other hand, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer focus, suggesting they are likely to manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could provide a stable alternative. The overall impact on Apple's core business is likely to be limited, as the Apple Card is a relatively small part of their overall revenue. Given Apple's resilience and ability to adapt, the negative impact is likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is likely to have a limited impact on Apple's stock price. While the partnership's termination could cause short-term disruption to Apple Card features and potentially impact user experience, the article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and maintain its ecosystem.  Goldman Sachs' struggles with the Apple Card are primarily their problem, not Apple's. Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected. The potential for a smooth transition with a new partner minimizes the risk of significant negative impact on Apple's stock.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the impact is likely to be relatively small given the overall strength of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks due to higher bond yields, inflated tech expectations, and the potential for better earnings growth in other sectors like financials. Apple's stock has already declined by 8% year-to-date, indicating some negative sentiment. The article highlights that the Mag 7's earnings growth is expected to slow in 2025, which could further dampen investor enthusiasm. However, Apple's strong balance sheet and repetitive earnings growth might provide some support. Overall, the negative sentiment and shift in focus are likely to weigh more heavily on the stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically his response to the notion that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer finds this statement 'inflammatory' and highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. While the article does not contain overwhelmingly positive or negative news about Apple's stock performance, Cramer's defense of the company's innovation suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook. However, the overall impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not provide any significant new information about Apple's financials or future product releases. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a positive outlook due to Cramer's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline often reflects concerns about the company's future prospects, such as potential declines in sales, increased competition, or other challenges that could negatively impact the stock price. Given the negative tone of the headline, it is reasonable to infer that the news could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership, which has been a financial burden with significant losses and regulatory penalties. This could impact Apple's financial ecosystem negatively, particularly its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple is known for innovation and might mitigate any disruptions effectively. On the other hand, Goldman's core businesses are performing well, which might offset some of the negative impacts.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's defense of Apple Inc. against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which could be seen as a positive sentiment for the stock. However, there are mixed signals regarding Apple's performance in the current market, particularly concerning AI and iPhone sales. While Cramer acknowledges some positive aspects of the broader market, there are underlying concerns about innovation and competition. Given the cautious tone and the mixed performance of AAPL, the probabilities of stock price movement are balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to Cramer's positive remarks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial services offerings, which could negatively impact user experience. However, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer focus, suggesting they are likely to manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could provide a stable alternative. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight shift towards a more neutral outlook compared to the initial negative reactions. Given Apple's resilience and ability to adapt, the negative impact is likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from the Apple Card partnership presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While the loss of a partner and potential disruption to Apple Card services could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term, the impact is likely to be limited. Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected.  The article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and find a new partner, minimizing the risk of significant long-term negative consequences.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  Considering Apple's history of successfully navigating challenges and the relatively small scale of the Apple Card compared to Apple's overall business, the probability of a significant stock price drop is low.  However, some short-term volatility and negative sentiment are possible during the transition period.  Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price rise, reflecting the overall strength of Apple's business and its capacity to manage this change effectively.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks due to higher bond yields, inflated tech expectations, and the potential for better earnings growth in other sectors like financials.

Overall, the negative sentiment and shift in focus are likely to weigh more heavily on the stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions regarding the potential impact of various factors on Apple's stock price. However, the overall trend seems to lean towards a cautious or negative outlook due to concerns about innovation, competition, and potential disruptions in partnerships. Given the negative tone of the headline and the mixed but leaning towards negative previous predictions, it is reasonable to infer that the news could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. Although Goldman Sachs' core businesses are performing well, the impact on Apple's financial ecosystem could be concerning, especially if there's a disruption in the Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's strong history of innovation and ability to adapt may help mitigate these risks. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for a smooth transition with a new partner, the probabilities seem balanced.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
