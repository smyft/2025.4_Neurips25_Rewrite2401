(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jim Cramer on Apple Inc (AAPL): \u2018When You Say That There\u2019s Been No Innovation Since Steve, I Find That Inflammatory\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly addressing the perception of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer finds this view inflammatory, he also acknowledges the mixed performance of AAPL in the current market context, especially regarding AI and iPhone sales. The overall sentiment appears to be cautious, with some positive notes about broader market performance but concerns about innovation and competition. Given the mixed signals and the current market environment, the probabilities of stock price movement are balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to Cramer's positive remarks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the potential exit of Goldman Sachs from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial services offerings. This could negatively impact user experience and loyalty, at least in the short term. The reliance on Goldman for backend support means a partner swap could be complex and potentially costly. On the other hand, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer focus, suggesting they are likely to manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could provide a stable alternative. The overall impact on Apple's core business is likely to be limited, as the Apple Card is a relatively small part of their overall revenue. Given Apple's resilience and ability to adapt, the negative impact is likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is likely to have a limited impact on Apple's stock price. While the partnership's termination could cause short-term disruption to Apple Card features and potentially impact user experience, the article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and maintain its ecosystem.  Goldman Sachs' struggles with the Apple Card are primarily their problem, not Apple's. Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected. The potential for a smooth transition with a new partner minimizes the risk of significant negative impact on Apple's stock.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, although the impact is likely to be relatively small given the overall strength of Apple's business.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks due to higher bond yields, inflated tech expectations, and the potential for better earnings growth in other sectors like financials. Apple's stock has already declined by 8% year-to-date, indicating some negative sentiment. The article highlights that the Mag 7's earnings growth is expected to slow in 2025, which could further dampen investor enthusiasm. However, Apple's strong balance sheet and repetitive earnings growth might provide some support. Overall, the negative sentiment and shift in focus are likely to weigh more heavily on the stock in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), specifically his response to the notion that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer finds this statement 'inflammatory' and highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. While the article does not contain overwhelmingly positive or negative news about Apple's stock performance, Cramer's defense of the company's innovation suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook. However, the overall impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not provide any significant new information about Apple's financials or future product releases. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a positive outlook due to Cramer's comments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. This kind of headline often reflects concerns about the company's future prospects, such as potential declines in sales, increased competition, or other challenges that could negatively impact the stock price. Given the negative tone of the headline, it is reasonable to infer that the news could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Goldman Sachs is considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership, which has been a financial burden with significant losses and regulatory penalties. This could impact Apple's financial ecosystem negatively, particularly its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple is known for innovation and might mitigate any disruptions effectively. On the other hand, Goldman's core businesses are performing well, which might offset some of the negative impacts.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's defense of Apple Inc. against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which could be seen as a positive sentiment for the stock. However, there are mixed signals regarding Apple's performance in the current market, particularly concerning AI and iPhone sales. While Cramer acknowledges some positive aspects of the broader market, there are underlying concerns about innovation and competition. Given the cautious tone and the mixed performance of AAPL, the probabilities of stock price movement are balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to Cramer's positive remarks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial services offerings, which could negatively impact user experience. However, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer focus, suggesting they are likely to manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could provide a stable alternative. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight shift towards a more neutral outlook compared to the initial negative reactions. Given Apple's resilience and ability to adapt, the negative impact is likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from the Apple Card partnership presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While the loss of a partner and potential disruption to Apple Card services could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term, the impact is likely to be limited. Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected.  The article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and find a new partner, minimizing the risk of significant long-term negative consequences.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  Considering Apple's history of successfully navigating challenges and the relatively small scale of the Apple Card compared to Apple's overall business, the probability of a significant stock price drop is low.  However, some short-term volatility and negative sentiment are possible during the transition period.  Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price rise, reflecting the overall strength of Apple's business and its capacity to manage this change effectively.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks due to higher bond yields, inflated tech expectations, and the potential for better earnings growth in other sectors like financials.

Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions regarding the potential impact of various factors on Apple's stock price. However, the overall trend seems to lean towards a cautious or negative outlook due to concerns about innovation, competition, and potential disruptions in partnerships. Given the negative tone of the headline and the mixed but leaning towards negative previous predictions, it is reasonable to infer that the news could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from its Apple Card partnership due to financial losses and regulatory issues. Although Goldman Sachs' core businesses are performing well, the impact on Apple's financial ecosystem could be concerning, especially if there's a disruption in the Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's strong history of innovation and ability to adapt may help mitigate these risks. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for a smooth transition with a new partner, the probabilities seem balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news discusses Jim Cramer's defense of Apple Inc. against claims of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs, which could be interpreted as a positive sentiment for the stock.

While there might be short-term disruptions, the core business remains robust. Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the uncertainty, but there's a slight trend towards a more neutral outlook. Considering Apple's ability to adapt and the potential for a new partnership, the negative impact is likely to be limited. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, but acknowledging the potential for short-term volatility.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership is a relatively minor event for Apple, given the scale of Apple's overall business. While it introduces some uncertainty and potential short-term disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong track record of innovation and its ability to find a new partner mitigate the risk of significant negative impact.  The financial losses and regulatory issues are primarily Goldman Sachs' problems.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty, but the overall trend leans slightly towards a rise, with most models predicting a probability of a rise above 0.4.  Considering Apple's resilience, the likely smooth transition to a new partner, and the relatively small scale of the Apple Card compared to Apple's overall business, the probability of a significant stock price drop is low.  However, some short-term volatility is possible during the transition period.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise, reflecting the overall strength of Apple's business and its capacity to manage this change effectively.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks due to higher bond yields, inflated tech expectations, and the potential for better earnings growth in other sectors like financials.

However, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and managing transitions smoothly. Previous predictions vary widely, with some leaning towards a rise in stock price due to Apple's resilience, while others lean towards a fall due to the potential short-term disruptions and broader market sentiments.
