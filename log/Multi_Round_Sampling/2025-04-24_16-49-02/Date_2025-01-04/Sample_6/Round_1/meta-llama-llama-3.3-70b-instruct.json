      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks that are expected to soar, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. While Apple is heavily invested in AI technologies, the focus on other stocks may divert investor attention. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative, as it may not benefit directly from the excitement surrounding the mentioned AI stocks. The probabilities reflect a cautious outlook on AAPL's stock price movement in response to this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for AI stocks, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth. While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple as one of the two stocks poised for this specific growth. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate. The positive sentiment surrounding AI could create a slight upward pressure, but it's not a direct endorsement of Apple's AI capabilities or stock. The lack of direct mention and the general nature of the AI sector boost temper the potential impact. Also, the $4 Trillion target is for the sector, not necessarily for Apple itself.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks predicted to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of the mentioned companies. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other market factors. We assume a neutral market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) by a Wall Street analyst, specifically highlighting its potential in the AI sector and predicting a significant market cap increase by 2025. Such positive analyst sentiment, especially when tied to growth sectors like AI, tends to attract investor interest and can drive stock prices higher in the short to medium term. There is no immediate negative information provided that would suggest a stock price fall. However, market conditions, investor sentiment, and other external factors can influence the actual outcome.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst suggests buying two AI stocks before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks to buy. Given that the news is about other AI stocks reaching a significant valuation, it does not directly imply a positive or negative impact on AAPL. The mention of AI, which is relevant to Apple's current and future projects, might have a mildly positive effect. However, without direct mention or specific catalysts related to AAPL, the probabilities of stock price rise or fall are relatively balanced with a slight bias towards a positive impact due to the general relevance of AI to AAPL's business.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. This positive outlook and expectation of significant growth in the AI sector is likely to have a bullish effect on the stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple is one of the leading companies in the technology sector, it is likely that AI developments could positively impact its stock price. However, since the news does not directly reference Apple, the impact on AAPL's stock price may be indirect and less pronounced compared to if the news had directly mentioned Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling. Format your response in JSON format and include the following information as follows: \n{ \n\"reasoning\": \"[Summarize your analysis and reasoning process here]\", \n\"company_name\": \"[Company Name indicating the name of the company]\", \n\"company_symbol\": \"[Company Symbol indicating the stock symbol of the company]\", \n\"news_headline\": \"[News Headline indicating the provided financial news headline]\", \n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": [The estimated probability (a number between 0 and 1) that the stock price will rise due to this news], \n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": [The estimated probability (a number between 0 and 1) that the stock price will fall due to this news], \n} \nDo not generate output that isn't in properly formatted JSON."
