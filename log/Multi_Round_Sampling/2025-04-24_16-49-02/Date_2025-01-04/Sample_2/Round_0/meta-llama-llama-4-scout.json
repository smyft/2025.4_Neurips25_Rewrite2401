(AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks to buy. Given that AAPL is a major tech company and a leader in AI integration through its products like Siri, Core ML, and others, the news might have an indirect positive impact. Nonetheless, without direct mention, the impact is likely to be minimal. The probability of a significant stock price movement based on this news seems low. However, considering the general positive sentiment around AI and tech giants, there's a slight bias towards a potential rise rather than a fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
