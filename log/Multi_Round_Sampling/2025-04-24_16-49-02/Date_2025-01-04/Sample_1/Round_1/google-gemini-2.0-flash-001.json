      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks that are expected to soar, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. While Apple is heavily involved in AI technology, the focus on other stocks may divert investor attention. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative, as investors may shift their focus to the highlighted stocks. However, given Apple's strong market position and ongoing investments in AI, there is still a reasonable chance for the stock to rise. Overall, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for AI stocks, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth. While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple as one of the two stocks poised for substantial growth. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate. The positive sentiment surrounding AI could create a slight upward pressure, but the lack of direct mention limits the potential surge. Also, the $4 Trillion valuation is for the AI sector as a whole, not necessarily for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks predicted to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of the mentioned companies. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other market factors. We assume a neutral market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is identified as one of the top AI stocks to buy before a potential surge to $4 trillion by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Such endorsements from analysts, especially those highlighting significant growth potential, tend to positively influence investor sentiment and can drive stock prices higher. Given the positive nature of the news and the credibility of the source (Wall Street analyst), the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. However, it's important to note that market reactions can sometimes be unpredictable due to external factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst suggests buying two AI stocks before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks. Given that AAPL is a large and well-established company with a significant presence in the tech industry, its stock price movement is typically influenced by its own product releases, financial reports, and market trends rather than generic AI stock recommendations. Therefore, the impact of this specific news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low, but if there's any effect, it's slightly more likely to be positive given the overall positive sentiment about AI stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. This positive outlook and expectation of significant growth in the AI sector are likely to have a bullish effect on the stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple is one of the leading companies in the technology sector, it is likely that AI developments could positively impact its stock price. However, since the news does not directly reference Apple, the impact on AAPL's stock price may be indirect and less pronounced compared to if the news had directly mentioned Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The previous predictions are quite varied, with some assuming Apple is one of the stocks and others explicitly stating it isn't. The models that assumed Apple was included gave higher probabilities of a rise. However, the more cautious models, recognizing the lack of direct mention, gave more neutral or even slightly negative predictions. Given the ambiguity and the fact that the news doesn't directly highlight Apple, I'll lean towards a more neutral stance, but slightly positive due to the general AI hype. I will also consider the trend of previous predictions, and try to be in the middle of the previous predictions.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.58,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.42\n}\n```"
