(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks that are expected to soar, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. While Apple is heavily invested in AI technologies, the focus on other stocks may divert investor attention. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative, as investors may be more inclined to invest in the highlighted stocks. However, Apple's strong market position and ongoing innovations in AI could still support a moderate probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for AI stocks, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth. While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple as one of the two stocks poised for substantial growth. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate. The positive sentiment surrounding AI could create a slight upward pressure, but the lack of direct mention limits the potential surge. Also, the $4 Trillion valuation is for the AI sector as a whole, not necessarily for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks predicted to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of the mentioned companies. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other market factors. We assume a neutral market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is identified as one of the AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Such optimistic projections, especially from a credible source, typically generate positive sentiment among investors, leading to increased buying interest. However, the actual impact on the stock price will depend on market conditions, investor confidence, and broader economic factors. Given the positive nature of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but it is not guaranteed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst suggests buying two AI stocks before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks. Given that AAPL is a large and well-established company with a significant presence in the tech industry, its stock price movement is typically influenced by its own product releases, financial reports, and market trends rather than generic AI stock recommendations. Therefore, the impact of this specific news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low, but if there's any effect, it's slightly more likely to be positive given the overall positive sentiment about AI stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. This positive outlook and expectation of significant growth in the AI sector are likely to have a bullish effect on the stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two specific AI stocks that are expected to perform well, but it does not specify Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since there is no direct mention of Apple Inc., it's likely that the news may have an indirect impact or no impact at all on the stock price of Apple Inc. Therefore, the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. rising or falling due to this news is minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to soar, but does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) specifically. While Apple is a significant player in the AI space, the focus on other stocks may lead to a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price. The overall positive sentiment around AI could provide some upward pressure, but the lack of direct mention limits the potential for a significant rise. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the possibility of a fall due to the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on two AI stocks expected to soar, but it doesn't explicitly name Apple. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some models assuming Apple is one of the stocks and others explicitly stating it isn't. The models that assume Apple is included give a higher probability of a price rise. However, the models that correctly identify that Apple isn't explicitly mentioned give a more neutral outlook. Given the ambiguity and the fact that Apple is a large, established company, the impact of this news is likely to be muted. I will lean towards a slightly positive outlook, as general positive sentiment around AI could benefit Apple indirectly, but not significantly. Considering the range of previous predictions, I'll adjust my probabilities to reflect a more conservative estimate, acknowledging the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on two unnamed AI stocks predicted for massive growth.  Apple is not mentioned. While Apple is involved in AI, this news is unlikely to directly impact its stock price.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from a neutral stance (0.5/0.5) to a slightly bullish outlook (0.7/0.3 or 0.8/0.2).  The wide range reflects the ambiguity of the news regarding Apple.  Given the lack of direct relevance and the overall market factors influencing AAPL, a neutral to slightly positive impact is most likely.  I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the general positive sentiment surrounding AI, but the effect is likely to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not explicitly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). While Apple is a major player in AI, the lack of direct mention suggests the news may have minimal direct impact on its stock price. However, the overall positive sentiment around AI could indirectly benefit Apple, given its strong market position and AI investments. Previous predictions vary, with some models suggesting a neutral to slightly positive impact, while others see minimal effect. Considering the mixed signals and the absence of direct relevance to AAPL, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a neutral to positive impact due to broader AI sector optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Despite Apple's significant involvement in AI technologies, the lack of direct mention may lead to a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price. Investors might be more inclined to invest in the highlighted stocks, potentially diverting attention away from Apple. However, considering Apple's strong market position and ongoing innovations in AI, there is still a moderate probability of the stock price rising. The overall sentiment about AI stocks is positive, which could create a slight upward pressure on AAPL's stock price due to its own AI initiatives.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. However, considering the overall positive sentiment about AI stocks and Apple's significant presence in the tech industry, including its investments in AI technologies, there could be an indirect positive impact on Apple's stock price. Analyzing the predictions from previous rounds, there is a wide range of opinions, from a high probability of the stock price rising to a low probability. This discrepancy suggests that the impact of the news on Apple's stock price is uncertain and may depend on how investors perceive Apple's position within the AI sector. Given the lack of direct mention but the potential for positive sentiment spillover, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The financial news headline discusses two specific AI stocks that are expected to perform exceptionally well, reaching a combined valuation of $4 trillion by 2025. Although Apple Inc. (AAPL) is involved in AI technologies, the news does not explicitly mention Apple as one of the two stocks. The mixed opinions from various models suggest a range of probabilities, from minimal impact to significant positive sentiment. Considering Apple's broad business diversification beyond AI and the specific focus of the news on two other stocks, the direct impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be limited. However, the positive sentiment around AI and the general tech sector could moderately influence investor behavior.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to soar, but does not mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) specifically. While Apple is a significant player in the AI space, the focus on other stocks may lead to a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price.

Given the mixed predictions from previous rounds, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the possibility of a fall due to the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on two AI stocks expected to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, but it doesn't explicitly mention Apple (AAPL). While Apple is involved in AI, the lack of direct mention suggests the news may have a limited direct impact on its stock price. The previous round of predictions shows a wide range of opinions, with most models leaning towards a neutral to slightly positive impact due to the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI. However, some models suggest a slightly negative impact as investors might focus on the mentioned stocks instead of Apple. Considering the ambiguity and the fact that Apple is a large, established company, the impact of this news is likely to be muted. I will lean towards a slightly positive outlook, as general positive sentiment around AI could benefit Apple indirectly, but not significantly. Given the trend of previous predictions converging towards a more neutral stance, I will adjust my probabilities to reflect a more conservative estimate, acknowledging the uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline focuses on two unnamed AI stocks projected for massive growth, explicitly excluding Apple.  While Apple is a major player in AI, this news is unlikely to directly impact its stock price significantly.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the ambiguity of the news's relevance to Apple.  The consensus leans towards a slightly positive but muted impact, primarily due to the general positive sentiment surrounding AI, which could indirectly benefit Apple. However, the lack of direct mention and the influence of other market factors suggest a limited effect.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the tendency of previous models to overestimate the impact of indirectly related news, I'm assigning a probability closer to neutral, slightly favoring a rise due to the positive AI sentiment but acknowledging the limited direct relevance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, but it does not explicitly mention Apple Inc.
