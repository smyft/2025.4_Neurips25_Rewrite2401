      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks that are expected to soar, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. While Apple is heavily invested in AI technologies, the focus on other stocks may divert investor attention. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative, as investors may be more inclined to invest in the highlighted stocks. However, Apple's strong market position and ongoing innovations in AI could still support a moderate probability of price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for AI stocks, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth. While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple as one of the two stocks poised for substantial growth. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate. The positive sentiment surrounding AI could create a slight upward pressure, but the lack of direct mention limits the potential surge. Also, the $4 Trillion valuation is for the AI sector as a whole, not necessarily for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks predicted to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of the mentioned companies. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other market factors. We assume a neutral market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is identified as one of the AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Such optimistic projections, especially from a credible source, typically generate positive sentiment among investors, leading to increased buying interest. However, the actual impact on the stock price will depend on market conditions, investor confidence, and broader economic factors. Given the positive nature of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but it is not guaranteed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst suggests buying two AI stocks before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks. Given that AAPL is a large and well-established company with a significant presence in the tech industry, its stock price movement is typically influenced by its own product releases, financial reports, and market trends rather than generic AI stock recommendations. Therefore, the impact of this specific news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low, but if there's any effect, it's slightly more likely to be positive given the overall positive sentiment about AI stocks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. This positive outlook and expectation of significant growth in the AI sector are likely to have a bullish effect on the stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two specific AI stocks that are expected to perform well, but it does not specify Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since there is no direct mention of Apple Inc., it's likely that the news may have an indirect impact or no impact at all on the stock price of Apple Inc. Therefore, the probability of the stock price of Apple Inc. rising or falling due to this news is minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
