(AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks. Given that AAPL is a large and well-established company with a significant presence in the tech industry, its stock price movement is typically influenced by its own product releases, financial reports, and market trends rather than generic AI stock recommendations. Therefore, the impact of this specific news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be minimal. The probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low, but if there's any effect, it's slightly more likely to be positive given the overall positive sentiment about AI stocks.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
