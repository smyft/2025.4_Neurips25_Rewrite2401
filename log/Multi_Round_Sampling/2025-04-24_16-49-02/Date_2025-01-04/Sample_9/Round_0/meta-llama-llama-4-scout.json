(AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks. Given that AAPL is a well-established company and not directly mentioned, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the general positive sentiment around tech stocks, but it's not a direct recommendation for AAPL.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
