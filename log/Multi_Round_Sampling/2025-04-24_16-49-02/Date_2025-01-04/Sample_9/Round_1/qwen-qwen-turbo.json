      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks that are expected to soar, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. While Apple is heavily involved in AI technology, the focus on other stocks may divert investor attention. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative, as investors may be more inclined to invest in the highlighted stocks. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for AI stocks, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth. While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple as one of the two stocks poised for substantial growth. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate. The positive sentiment surrounding AI could create a slight upward pressure, but the lack of direct mention limits the potential surge. Also, the $4 Trillion valuation is for the AI sector as a whole, not necessarily for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks predicted to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of the mentioned companies. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other market factors. We assume a neutral market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it is identified as one of the AI stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Such optimistic projections, especially from credible sources, often lead to increased investor confidence and buying activity, which can drive the stock price up in the short term. However, the actual movement will depend on market sentiment, broader economic conditions, and the company's performance. Given the positive tone of the news, the probability of a price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst suggests buying two AI stocks before they soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided news content as one of the stocks. The news seems to be more about other AI stocks. Given that AAPL is a well-established company and not directly mentioned, the impact of this news on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the general positive sentiment around tech stocks, but it's not a direct recommendation for AAPL.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that a Wall Street analyst is predicting significant growth in the Artificial Intelligence (AI) sector, specifically mentioning that AI stocks could soar to $4 trillion in 2025. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech industry and has been investing in AI research and development, this prediction could positively impact the company's stock price. The mention of '2 AI Stocks to Buy' implies that Apple might be one of the recommended stocks, which could lead to increased investor interest and potentially drive up the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple is one of the leading companies in the technology sector, it is likely that AI developments could positively impact its stock price. However, without specific mention of Apple in the news content, it's challenging to attribute a direct impact on its stock price solely based on this headline. The probability of a positive reaction might be slightly higher than usual due to the broader market sentiment towards AI stocks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
