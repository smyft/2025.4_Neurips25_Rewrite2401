While Apple is heavily involved in AI technology, the focus on other stocks may divert investor attention. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative, as investors may be more inclined to invest in the highlighted stocks. However, Apple's strong market position and ongoing AI initiatives could still support its stock price. Thus, the probability of a price rise is estimated to be moderate, while the probability of a price fall is lower due to Apple's overall strength.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.30\n}\n```"
