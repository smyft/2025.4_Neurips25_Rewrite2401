      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks that are expected to soar, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. While Apple is heavily involved in AI technology, the focus on other stocks may divert investor attention away from AAPL. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be neutral to slightly negative, as investors may choose to invest in the highlighted stocks instead. The probabilities reflect a cautious outlook on AAPL's stock price movement in light of this news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for AI stocks, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth. While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple as one of the two stocks poised for substantial growth. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate. The positive sentiment surrounding AI could create a slight upward pressure, but the lack of direct mention limits the potential surge. Also, the $4 Trillion valuation is for the AI sector as a whole, not necessarily for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks predicted to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of the mentioned companies. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other market factors.  We assume a neutral market reaction, with probabilities slightly favoring a minor price change due to general market fluctuations.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an AI stock with potential to reach a $4 trillion valuation by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Such bullish analyst predictions typically generate investor optimism, leading to increased buying interest and upward pressure on the stock price. Since there is no negative or bearish sentiment in the headline, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that a Wall Street analyst has high expectations for Apple's stock performance, predicting it could be part of a $4 trillion market valuation by 2025, driven by advancements and adoption in Artificial Intelligence (AI). This kind of optimistic forecast typically boosts investor confidence and can lead to increased buying activity, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the actual impact on the stock price depends on various factors including the company's future performance, market conditions, and how the news is perceived by investors. Given the positive outlook and potential for AI to significantly influence tech companies' growth, there's a reasonable basis to believe the stock price could rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. This positive outlook and expectation of significant growth in the AI sector are likely to have a bullish effect on the stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple is not directly referenced in the news, there's no direct impact on Apple's stock price movement from this news. However, general positive sentiment towards AI stocks might indirectly influence investor behavior. Considering the lack of specific relevance to Apple, the probability remains neutral.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling. Format your response in JSON format and include the following information as follows: \n{ \n\"reasoning\": \"[Summarize your analysis and reasoning process here]\", \n\"company_name\": \"[Company Name indicating the name of the company]\", \n\"company_symbol\": \"[Company Symbol indicating the stock symbol of the company]\", \n\"news_headline\": \"[News Headline indicating the provided financial news headline]\", \n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": [The estimated probability (a number between 0 and 1) that the stock price will rise due to this news], \n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": [The estimated probability (a number between 0 and 1) that the stock price will fall due to this news], \n} \nDo not generate output that isn't in properly formatted JSON."
