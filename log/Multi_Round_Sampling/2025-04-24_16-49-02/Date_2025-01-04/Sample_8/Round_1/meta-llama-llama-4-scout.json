      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\nNews Content: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks that are expected to soar, but it does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of those stocks. While Apple is heavily involved in AI technology, the focus on other stocks may divert investor attention away from AAPL. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative, as investors may be more inclined to invest in the highlighted stocks. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for AI stocks, with a Wall Street analyst predicting significant growth. While Apple is involved in AI, the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple as one of the two stocks poised for substantial growth. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate. The positive sentiment surrounding AI could create a slight upward pressure, but the lack of direct mention limits the potential surge. Also, the $4 Trillion valuation is for the AI sector as a whole, not necessarily for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline mentions two AI stocks predicted to reach a combined $4 trillion valuation by 2025.  Apple (AAPL) is not one of the mentioned companies. Therefore, this news is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Any price movement in AAPL would be unrelated to this specific news and would be driven by other market factors. We assume a neutral market reaction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a bullish outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an AI stock with potential to soar to $4 trillion by 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. Such optimistic projections, especially from a credible source, often generate positive sentiment among investors, leading to increased buying interest. However, the actual impact on the stock price will depend on market conditions, investor confidence, and broader economic factors. Given the positive tone of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall, but it is not guaranteed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that a Wall Street analyst predicts two AI stocks will soar to $4 trillion in 2025. However, the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the stocks. Given that the news is about other AI stocks reaching a significant valuation, it does not directly imply a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The lack of direct mention or specific positive commentary about Apple suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact, as investors might consider rotating into the mentioned AI stocks. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower, and the probability of it falling is higher, but both are not drastically skewed.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is one of the two Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks expected to soar to $4 trillion in 2025, according to a Wall Street analyst. This positive outlook and expectation of significant growth in the AI sector are likely to have a bullish effect on the stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news headline discusses two AI stocks but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple is one of the leading companies in the technology sector, it is likely that AI developments could positively impact its stock price. However, since the news does not directly reference Apple, the impact on AAPL's stock price may be indirect and less pronounced compared to if the news had directly mentioned Apple.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
