However, the headline does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the stocks. Given that the news is about other AI stocks reaching a significant valuation, it does not directly imply a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. The lack of direct mention or specific positive commentary about Apple suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact, as investors might consider rotating into the mentioned AI stocks. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower, and the probability of it falling is higher, but both are not drastically skewed.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before They Soar to $4 Trillion in 2025, According to a Wall Street Analyst\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
