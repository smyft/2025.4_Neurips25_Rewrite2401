(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The headline poses a question about whether to buy stock in Apple Inc., the largest company in the world. This suggests a level of uncertainty or debate among investors. However, being the largest company often implies strong fundamentals and market confidence. The lack of negative news or specific concerns in the content may lead to a higher probability of stock price stability or a slight rise, as investors may view this as a buying opportunity. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the US government's AI chip export restrictions could indirectly benefit Apple by hindering the growth of Chinese competitors like Xiaomi and Vivo. However, the restrictions also highlight the increasing geopolitical tensions and the potential for further limitations on Apple's operations in China, a crucial market. Furthermore, the article points out Apple's recent struggles with market share and the mixed reception of its AI offerings, particularly in China. The uncertainty surrounding the incoming Trump administration's AI policies adds another layer of complexity. Overall, the negative factors seem to outweigh the potential benefits, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including revenue growth, a robust cash position, and significant shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best safe dividend stocks' suggests a positive outlook from the perspective of the article's authors. However, the article also acknowledges that while Apple is a strong company, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  The mention of Apple's underweight position by Parnassus Investments introduces a note of caution.  Overall, the news is largely positive but not overwhelmingly bullish. The probability of a price rise is tempered by the acknowledgement of potentially more lucrative AI investments. The probability of a fall is low, given the generally positive financial picture presented.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the best safe dividend stocks for 2025, emphasizing its strong position in the market, consistent dividend payments, and robust cash flow. The company's revenue growth, active device count, and innovative AI capabilities are seen as positive indicators for future performance. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple has a low 5-year average payout ratio of 17.4%, indicating a strong cash position, and it is favored by hedge funds. These factors suggest a positive outlook for the stock. However, the dividend yield is relatively low at 0.42%, which might not attract yield-seeking investors. Overall, the positive aspects outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 results and highlights challenges despite a 4% revenue growth forecast. The analyst, Brandon Nispel, maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target for Apple, citing concerns such as the absence of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. These factors could lead to a negative stock price movement. However, the article also mentions that Apple's guidance might match Wall Street's earnings projections, which could provide some stability. Overall, the challenges and cautious tone from the analyst seem to outweigh the positive aspects, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is vague and does not provide specific information about Apple Inc.'s financial performance, products, or market trends. However, the term 'luxury stocks' could imply a positive sentiment towards high-end brands like Apple, potentially indicating a slight increase in stock price. Given the lack of concrete details, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but both probabilities are close to 50% due to the ambiguity of the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strong competitive advantage, significant market presence, and potential for future growth through services and AI integration. The article emphasizes the company's consistent performance and its dominance in the market, indicating a positive outlook for investors. While it acknowledges that Apple might not match the explosive growth of younger tech companies, it still recommends Apple as a compelling buy for most investors. This positive sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of stock price increase.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
