However, the term 'luxury stocks' could imply a positive sentiment towards high-end brands like Apple, potentially indicating a slight increase in stock price. Given the lack of concrete details, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but both probabilities are close to 50% due to the ambiguity of the news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
