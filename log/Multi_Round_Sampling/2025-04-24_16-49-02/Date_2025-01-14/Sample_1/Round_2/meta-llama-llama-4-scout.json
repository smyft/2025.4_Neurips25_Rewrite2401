(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong position as a safe dividend stock, particularly in a favorable market environment. The company's solid financial performance, including revenue growth and a strong cash position, supports the likelihood of continued investor interest. Additionally, the mention of Apple in a list of top dividend stocks and its inclusion in numerous hedge fund portfolios suggests positive sentiment. However, potential market volatility and external factors could impact stock performance. Overall, the positive outlook and strong fundamentals lead to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple (AAPL). It highlights Apple's strong competitive advantage, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new areas like AI and services. The article suggests that while Apple may not offer the same explosive growth as smaller companies, it remains a compelling buy for most investors due to its market dominance and future growth potential. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's Stock Advisor team did not include Apple in their list of the 10 best stocks to buy now, suggesting that there might be better opportunities elsewhere. This creates a mixed signal. Considering the overall positive tone regarding Apple's fundamentals and future prospects, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but the mention of potentially better opportunities elsewhere tempers the enthusiasm.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The article presents a bullish outlook on Apple, highlighting its strong competitive advantage, substantial revenue and profit, and expansion into high-growth areas like services and AI.  While acknowledging that Apple's growth rate might not match that of younger, faster-growing tech companies, the article emphasizes its established market dominance and potential for continued growth.  However, the article also includes a counterpoint by mentioning that Apple wasn't included in Motley Fool's top 10 stock picks, suggesting some uncertainty.  The overall tone is positive but tempered with a realistic assessment of Apple's position in the market.  Considering the generally positive sentiment and Apple's history of strong performance, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given the inherent market volatility and the existence of alternative investment opportunities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential for Apple Inc. (AAPL) to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company, though it suggests Amazon (AMZN) has a clearer path due to its diversified growth drivers and historical valuation metrics. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high valuation as potential hurdles, while emphasizing Amazon's strong position in cloud services and other high-growth segments. Given the mixed sentiment and the focus on Amazon's potential rather than Apple's immediate prospects, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in regaining market share in 2025 with the help of AI. It mentions that Apple's iPhone market share slipped to 18% worldwide in 2024, and the company faced a 2% sales decline while the wider market grew 4%. The article also highlights the US government's new restrictions on AI chip exports, which could impact Apple's AI development and market performance. However, it also mentions that Apple is striving to partner with local players to provide AI features. The overall sentiment of the article is neutral to slightly negative, as it emphasizes Apple's challenges but also acknowledges its potential. Based on this analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.45 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.55.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s struggle to regain market share in 2025, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence. The US government's restrictions on AI chip and technology exports may affect Apple's ability to compete with Chinese companies. However, the article also mentions that Apple is striving to partner with local players to provide AI features, which could potentially help the company regain market share. Additionally, the article notes that Apple's AI suite is not available in China, which has hindered its performance in the region. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling, as the news highlights more challenges than opportunities for Apple Inc.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that TSMC will start supplying semiconductors to Apple from Q1 2025, marking a significant step towards 'Made in America' chips. This move is likely to enhance Apple's supply chain resilience, reduce geopolitical risks, and support U.S. semiconductor independence. It also suggests that the Arizona fab is on track and could attract more tech companies, which is a positive sign for the broader tech sector. These factors are generally seen positively by investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong position as a leading dividend stock, emphasizing its solid financial performance, consistent revenue growth, and a robust cash position. The inclusion of Apple in a list of top safe dividend stocks and its popularity among hedge funds suggests positive sentiment among investors. While there are concerns about potential market volatility and competition from other tech stocks, the overall outlook remains optimistic, particularly in a favorable market environment. This leads to a higher probability of stock price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its strong competitive advantage, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new areas like AI and services. It acknowledges that Apple may not offer the same explosive growth as smaller companies but remains a compelling buy for most investors due to its market dominance and future growth potential. The mention of Motley Fool's Stock Advisor team not including Apple in their list of the 10 best stocks is a slight negative, but the overall tone is positive. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, but most lean towards a positive outlook. Given the generally positive sentiment and Apple's history of strong performance, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a largely positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its strong competitive advantage, consistent profitability, and expansion into services and AI.  The mention of a strong five-year annualized return and the potential for continued growth in services and AI are bullish factors. However, the counterpoint that Apple wasn't included in Motley Fool's top 10 stock picks introduces a note of caution.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning more bullish and others more bearish.  Considering the overall positive tone but acknowledging the existence of potentially better investment opportunities elsewhere, and the inherent volatility of the market, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned. The fact that Apple is already a massive company suggests that the potential for explosive growth is limited compared to smaller, faster-growing companies.  The lack of a clear catalyst for a significant price jump in the near term also contributes to a more conservative prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s potential to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company but suggests that Amazon (AMZN) has a clearer path due to its diversified growth drivers and historical valuation metrics. The article highlights Apple's stagnant physical device sales and high valuation as potential hurdles, while emphasizing Amazon's strong position in cloud services and other high-growth segments. Given the mixed sentiment and the focus on Amazon's potential rather than Apple's immediate prospects, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly negative in the short term. Previous predictions also reflect a cautious outlook, with some models indicating a higher probability of a price fall due to the challenges mentioned.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in regaining market share in 2025 with the help of AI. It mentions that Apple's iPhone market share slipped to 18% worldwide in 2024, and the company faced a 2% sales decline while the wider market grew 4%. The US government's new restrictions on AI chip exports could impact Apple's ability to compete, particularly in China. However, Apple is also striving to partner with local players to provide AI features, which could potentially help the company regain market share. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment seems to be slightly negative due to Apple's challenges in AI development and market competition. The probability of a stock price rise seems lower compared to the likelihood of a fall, given the mixed performance and challenges in AI implementation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggle to regain market share in 2025, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence. The US government's restrictions on AI chip and technology exports may affect Apple's ability to compete with Chinese companies. However, the article also mentions that Apple is striving to partner with local players to provide AI features, which could potentially help the company regain market share. Considering the mixed sentiment and the focus on Apple's challenges, the overall tone of the article is neutral to slightly negative. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Taking into account the challenges and opportunities mentioned in the article, as well as the range of opinions from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.42 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's strategic move towards a more localized semiconductor supply chain through TSMC's Arizona fab. This move significantly enhances Apple's supply chain resilience, reduces geopolitical risks, and aligns with the broader U.S. objectives of achieving semiconductor independence. The positive sentiment around this development is further supported by previous predictions that show a generally positive outlook on Apple's growth and resilience. Although there were a few predictions indicating caution due to market competition and geopolitical risks, the overarching narrative remains positive.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
