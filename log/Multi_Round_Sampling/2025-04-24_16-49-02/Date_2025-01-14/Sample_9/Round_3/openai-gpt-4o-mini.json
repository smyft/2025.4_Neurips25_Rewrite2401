(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's 'Made in America' Chips: TSMC Arizona Fab Set to Launch Q1 2025\nNews Content: Following the report on Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) will start supplying semiconductors to Apple (AAPL, Financial) in Q1 2025, and it will stay set to begin using the semiconductors manufactured at the Arizona fab. Those processors are being quality verified in the batch of initial processors to be sure they're providing the same quality as TSMC's highest-end chips coming out of Taiwan, Nikkei Asia said. Apple's first major customer for the fab is expected to begin mass production as early as Q1 2025 if testing does not experience any setbacks.\n\nIt is a big step forward for the United States on its journey toward semiconductor independence by cutting reliance on Taiwan a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions with Beijing and natural disaster risks. The Arizona fab is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains as competition in the industry heats up globally.\n\nThe Arizona facility has led the transition, but other tech giants, such as AMD (AMD, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), are doing test production there, indicating a possible use of locally produced chips. For now, chips manufactured in Arizona are being shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until a new facility in Peoria, Arizona, is complete.\n\nLCY Chemical, a supplier now aligned close to an Arizona fab, which had its deployment delayed by about a year due to logistical challenges, is one of those. However, the project highlights the U.S. semiconductor industry's new tide of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities despite these hurdles.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant development that aligns with the trend of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. This move is likely to enhance Apple's supply chain resilience and reduce geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan. The announcement of mass production starting in Q1 2025 indicates a long-term positive outlook for Apple's operational capabilities. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling, as investors may view this as a strategic advantage for Apple in the competitive tech landscape.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a 4% revenue growth is projected, an analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target, suggesting potential downside. The analyst highlights challenges such as the lack of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone ban in Indonesia, and increased competition in China. Furthermore, concerns are raised about potential cannibalization from the iPhone SE and limited growth in other product categories. The analyst's 'underweight' rating and specific concerns outweigh the positive revenue growth forecast, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price decline. The fact that the analyst is sticking to their underweight rating despite the revenue growth forecast is a strong signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is too general to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  Apple, while having some high-end products, is not primarily considered a luxury brand in the same vein as companies like LVMH or Herm\u00e8s.  Therefore, this news item is largely irrelevant to Apple's valuation.  The probability of a price change due to this news is extremely low. We assume the market will react based on other factors, and the probability of a rise or fall will be approximately equal to the baseline probability of a rise or fall on a given day, which is assumed to be close to 50/50 in the absence of other significant news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple Inc. as it highlights the company's move towards semiconductor independence by sourcing chips from TSMC's Arizona fab, which is expected to begin mass production in Q1 2025. This reduces reliance on Taiwan, mitigating geopolitical and natural disaster risks. The involvement of other tech giants like AMD and Nvidia in test production at the same facility further validates the importance of this development. The transition to local manufacturing is seen as a strategic move to strengthen supply chains, which is generally viewed favorably by investors. Therefore, the news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming Q1 results and highlights challenges despite a 4% revenue growth forecast. The analyst, Brandon Nispel, maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target for Apple, citing concerns such as the absence of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. These factors may lead to a cautious market reaction. Given the analyst's negative stance and the mentioned challenges, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights potential challenges for Apple's Q1 results, including lower-than-expected guidance, absence of an AI-driven update cycle, iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and Chinese competitive pressures. Despite a forecasted 4% revenue growth, the analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and $200 price target, indicating a bearish outlook. The article also mentions limited growth in iPads, Macs, and wearables, and potential cannibalization of iPhone 16 sales by the iPhone SE. Based on these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is too vague to draw specific conclusions about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Luxury stocks typically refer to companies in sectors like fashion, jewelry, or premium goods. Without more context or details about how Apple Inc. is being discussed within the luxury stock category, it's challenging to accurately estimate the impact on Apple's stock price. Additionally, the content of the news article is missing, which would have provided necessary insights into the context.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant development that enhances Apple's supply chain resilience and reduces geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan. This move aligns with the trend of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S., which is generally viewed positively by investors. However, there are mixed signals from analysts regarding Apple's overall outlook, with some highlighting challenges such as competition and product cycle concerns. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the strategic importance of the Arizona fab and its potential long-term benefits for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.

In the previous round, the models were split, with some leaning towards a price decrease and others towards a price increase. Given the consistency of the analyst's underweight rating and the specific challenges mentioned, I am leaning towards a higher probability of a price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions are based on various news articles, some positive (reshoring of chip production) and some negative (analyst downgrades, competitive pressures). The positive news focuses on long-term strategic advantages, while the negative news highlights near-term challenges.  There's a significant divergence in opinions, with probabilities ranging from 0.1 to 0.75 for a price rise.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the headline and the conflicting information from previous predictions, I'll base my prediction on the average sentiment from the previous round, leaning slightly towards a neutral stance due to the irrelevance of the headline.  The wide range of predictions suggests significant uncertainty in the market regarding Apple's near-term prospects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant positive development for Apple. It enhances supply chain resilience, reduces geopolitical risks, and aligns with the U.S. trend of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing. The involvement of other tech giants like AMD and Nvidia in test production at the same facility further validates the importance of this development. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling. However, the previous predictions show mixed opinions, with some models highlighting potential challenges like analyst ratings and competitive pressures. Considering the overall positive sentiment and strategic importance of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately high.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 results are in focus, with an analyst warning of challenges despite a 4% revenue growth forecast. The analyst, Brandon Nispel, maintains an 'underweight' rating and a $200 price target for Apple, citing concerns such as the absence of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. These factors suggest a cautious market reaction and a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising. However, the forecasted 4% revenue growth is a positive indicator. Considering these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with a 4% revenue growth forecast but also several challenges, including the absence of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and competitive pressures in China. The analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and $200 price target, indicating a bearish outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing skepticism about Apple's stock performance, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. However, it's essential to note that the market's reaction can be unpredictable, and other factors may influence the stock price. Given the analyst's concerns and the mentioned challenges, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' does not provide any concrete information specific to Apple Inc., making it difficult to determine the stock price movement directly from this headline alone. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising due to positive developments like Apple's move towards semiconductor independence, and others predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling due to challenges like competition and lack of an AI-driven update cycle. Since the headline is too vague, the most reasonable assumption is that the stock price movement will be influenced by broader market trends and other factors not covered in this headline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant development that enhances Apple's supply chain resilience and reduces geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan.

Furthermore, concerns are raised about potential cannibalization from the iPhone SE and limited growth in other product categories. Considering the analyst's negative stance and the mentioned challenges, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising. The previous rounds of predictions show a trend towards increased skepticism, with more models leaning towards a price decrease. I will follow this trend and predict a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions are heavily influenced by other news sources detailing both positive (reshoring of chip production to Arizona) and negative (analyst downgrades, competitive pressures, lack of AI advancements) factors.  The positive news points to long-term strategic advantages, while the negative news highlights near-term challenges. There's a significant divergence of opinion among the models, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's short-term prospects.  The Arizona chip production is a positive long-term factor, but the analyst downgrades and competitive pressures present significant short-term headwinds.  Considering the weight of the negative short-term factors and the irrelevance of the headline, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a price rise.  The overall uncertainty is reflected in the probabilities being closer to 0.5 than to extreme values.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant development that enhances Apple's supply chain resilience and reduces geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan.
