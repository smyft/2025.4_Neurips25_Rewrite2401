(AAPL) or provide any specific information about the company's performance, products, or financials. Apple is generally considered a technology company rather than a luxury goods provider. Therefore, this news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of relevance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as low. The probabilities are roughly equal, with a slight bias towards no significant change, but for the purpose of this task, I will assign them as 0.5 for both.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
