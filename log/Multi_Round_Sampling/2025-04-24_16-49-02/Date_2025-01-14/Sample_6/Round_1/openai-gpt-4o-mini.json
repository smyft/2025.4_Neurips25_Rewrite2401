(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's struggle to maintain market share, particularly in the face of increasing competition from Chinese Android manufacturers. The recent U.S. government restrictions on AI chip exports may hinder Apple's ability to innovate and compete effectively in the AI space, which is crucial for regaining market share. Additionally, the mixed response to the iPhone 16 series and the decline in market share further suggest potential challenges ahead. While there is some optimism regarding AI's potential, the immediate outlook appears negative, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL) as a safe dividend stock for 2025. Several factors contribute to this assessment: 1) Apple's strong financial performance, including revenue growth and a substantial cash position, supports its ability to maintain and potentially increase its dividend payments. 2) The company's established position as a leading consumer brand and technology innovator provides a degree of stability. 3) The article highlights the historical outperformance of dividend stocks, particularly in low-interest-rate environments. 4) Apple's low payout ratio (17.4%) suggests that its dividend is well-covered and sustainable. 5) Hedge fund interest in AAPL is high, indicating confidence from sophisticated investors. However, the article also acknowledges potential risks, such as market volatility and the possibility of better AI stock opportunities. The article also mentions that dividends are not guaranteed and can fluctuate. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting a higher likelihood of a slight positive impact on the stock price. The article also mentions that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame, which could detract from AAPL's potential rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is projected to meet Wall Street's earnings expectations with a 4% revenue increase, the analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and a price target significantly below the current market price.  This suggests the analyst believes the market is overvaluing Apple.  Several factors contribute to this bearish outlook:  weak iPhone sales growth (potentially impacted by the iPhone SE and Indonesian ban), lack of an AI-driven update cycle (a significant growth driver for competitors), and increased competition from Chinese manufacturers. Although the revenue growth is positive, it falls short of typical seasonal performance, indicating underlying weakness. The analyst's concerns outweigh the positive revenue projection, leading to a higher probability of a price fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, there is a projected 4% revenue growth for the December quarter, which aligns with Wall Street's expectations. However, the analyst maintains an 'underweight' rating and points out several challenges: lack of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, competitive pressures in China, and potential demand dilution for the iPhone 16 due to the iPhone SE. Additionally, growth in other product categories like iPads, Macs, and wearables is described as limited. Given these factors, the market may react negatively to the guidance and challenges, outweighing the modest revenue growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is neutral and does not provide specific information that would cause a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The article's content is not provided, but based on the headline alone, it seems to be more of a general inquiry rather than a news piece with specific catalysts for stock movement. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. Given that it's a question about buying stock, it might slightly lean towards a positive view of the company, but it's not a strong enough signal to significantly sway stock prices.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is neutral and does not provide any specific positive or negative information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). It appears to be a generic investment advice article rather than a news article with new information that could impact the stock price. Given the lack of specific information, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are likely to be evenly distributed, with a slight bias towards a rise due to the general positive connotation of being referred to as the 'Largest Company in the World'. However, this effect is expected to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong financial performance, robust cash position, and favorable reception of its new product lineup, particularly the iPhone 16. The high number of hedge fund holders and their significant stake valuations indicate strong institutional support. Despite mentioning other AI stocks as potentially more promising, the overall tone is positive, supporting the view that Apple remains a solid dividend stock with growth potential.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
