(AAPL)\u2019s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nOn Monday, the US government revealed that it would further restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports. As reported by Reuters, the goal behind these restrictions is to help the US advance its computing power and AI technology, while finding more ways to block China\u2019s access. Under the new regulations, the number of AI chips exported to most countries will be capped, allowing unlimited access to U.S. AI technology for America\u2019s closest allies. Meanwhile, a block shall be maintained on exports to China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. leads AI now \u2013 both AI development and AI chip design, and it\u2019s critical that we keep it that way\u201d.\n\nREAD NOW:\u00a0Top 10 AI Stocks on Wall Street\u2019s Radar and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings\n\nThese regulations are seemingly the last efforts by the Biden administration to maintain US leadership in AI and close any loopholes in controlling the flow of AI chips. The new administration, set to take office on January 20, shares similar views on the competitive threat from China. However, President-elect Donald Trump is expected to make significant changes to the Biden administration\u2019s stance on artificial intelligence.\n\n\u201cWe will repeal Joe Biden\u2019s dangerous Executive Order that hinders AI innovation, and imposes radical leftwing ideas on the development of this technology. In its place, Republicans support AI development rooted in free speech and human flourishing\u201d.\n\nWith only a few days left until Trump takes office, the recently revealed restrictions on AI chips have been imposed on advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are used to power data centers needed to train AI models. Moreover, under the new rules, cloud providers will be able to build data centers by applying for global approval. Once approved, they won\u2019t need export licenses for AI chips which will allow them to build data centers in countries that cannot import enough chips because of the U.S.-imposed quotas. However, these authorized companies must abide by stringent conditions and restrictions, such as security requirements, reporting demands, and a plan or track record of respecting human rights.\n\nCurrently, the recent regulation divides the world into three tiers. 18 countries, including Japan, Britain, South Korea, and the Netherlands, will essentially be exempt from the rules. Moreover, 120 other countries, including Singapore, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates, will face country caps, whereas arms-embargoed countries like Russia, China, and Iran will not be allowed to receive the technology altogether.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cHow effective the rule ends up being in the next 10 to 15 years is now up to the incoming team. They are well aware that ensuring a dominant domestic industry is a core element of competition with China\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL)'s Struggle: Can AI Help Regain Market Share in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company. Recently, the company has had underwhelming upgrades and competitors that have led the iPhone maker to lose market share in the final quarter of 2024. Bloomberg cited research by Counterpoint Research data, stating how the iPhone\u2019s market share slipped a point to 18% worldwide in 2024. As per the research, the company marked a 2% sales decline for the full year, while the wider market grew 4% globally.\n\nOn the other hand, Android device makers from China, led by Xiaomi Corp. and Vivo, have been gaining strength in the region. Since Apple\u2019s new artificial intelligence suite isn\u2019t available in China, the lack of AI availability has hindered its performance in the region. The company is currently striving to partner up with local players to provide features such as AI writing assistance and image generation. Nevertheless, Apple\u2019s AI hasn\u2019t been all the rage, either.\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s iPhone 16 series was met with a mixed response, partly due to a lack of availability of Apple Intelligence at launch. However, Apple continued to grow strongly in its noncore markets like Latin America\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of important AI news and ratings on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong market position, consistent earnings growth, and potential for future expansion in services and AI. Despite some caution regarding its growth compared to younger tech companies, the overall sentiment is positive, suggesting that Apple remains a compelling investment for most investors. The historical performance and competitive advantages further support the likelihood of a stock price rise. However, the mention of alternative investment opportunities may introduce some uncertainty, leading to a lower probability of a significant price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple (AAPL). It highlights Apple's strong competitive advantage, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new areas like AI and services. The article suggests that while Apple may not offer the same explosive growth as smaller companies, it remains a compelling buy for most investors due to its market dominance and future growth potential. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's Stock Advisor team did not include Apple in their list of the 10 best stocks to buy now, suggesting that there might be better opportunities elsewhere. This creates a mixed signal. Considering the overall positive tone regarding Apple's fundamentals and future prospects, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but the mention of potentially better opportunities elsewhere tempers the enthusiasm.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including revenue growth, a robust cash position, and significant shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best safe dividend stocks' suggests a positive outlook from the perspective of the article's authors. However, the article also acknowledges that while Apple is a strong company, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  The mention of Apple's underweight position by Parnassus Investments introduces a note of caution.  Overall, the positive aspects of the news outweigh the negative, but the article doesn't present a strong bullish case for significant price appreciation solely based on its dividend prospects. The market's overall sentiment and broader economic factors will likely have a much larger impact on AAPL's price than this article alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is generic and does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple is primarily known for its technology products, though it has a luxury brand perception due to its premium pricing. Without concrete details linking the news to Apple's financials, products, or market position, the impact on its stock price is uncertain. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned neutrally.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in the market, particularly in relation to its competitors and the impact of AI on its market share. The US government's new regulations on AI chip exports may affect Apple's supply chain and competitive position. However, the article also highlights Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services. Given the mixed implications of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about Apple's competitive position and the potential impact of export restrictions on its AI capabilities.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s struggle to regain market share in 2025, particularly in the AI sector. The company has faced underwhelming upgrades and increased competition, leading to a decline in iPhone sales and market share. However, the US government's restrictions on AI chip exports may benefit Apple in the long run by limiting China's access to advanced AI technology. Additionally, Apple's efforts to partner with local players to provide AI features in China may help the company regain some ground. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall impact of the news is likely to be neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that Nvidia might not be the first to reach the $5 trillion valuation, and it might be impacted by the AI bubble. Amazon, on the other hand, is highlighted as having a clearer path to a $5 trillion market cap due to its robust cloud services and other growth segments. The article implies that Apple's valuation is already quite high and growth might be limited.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong market position, consistent earnings growth, and potential for future expansion in services and AI. While there are concerns about competition and the mention of better investment opportunities elsewhere, the overall sentiment remains positive. Apple's historical performance and competitive advantages suggest a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its strong competitive advantage, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new areas like AI and services. It suggests that while Apple may not offer the same explosive growth as smaller companies, it remains a compelling buy for most investors due to its market dominance and future growth potential. The mention of Apple Intelligence and its integration into products further reinforces this positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's Stock Advisor team did not include Apple in their list of the 10 best stocks to buy now, suggesting that there might be better opportunities elsewhere. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight decrease in the overall bullish sentiment. Taking all these factors into account, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards from the initial predictions, but still maintaining a positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While it highlights Apple's strong financial performance, consistent dividend payments, and large cash reserves,  it also acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in the shorter term.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best safe dividend stocks' is positive, but the relatively low dividend yield (0.42%) and the comparison to potentially higher-growth AI stocks temper the bullish sentiment.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall. Considering the overall positive fundamentals of Apple but acknowledging the potential for better returns elsewhere, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the company's stability and consistent performance, but not a significant one given the context of the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is somewhat ambiguous and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, previous predictions from other models indicate a generally positive outlook on Apple's strong market position, consistent earnings growth, and potential for future expansion in services and AI. Some concerns were raised about competition and market share, but the overall sentiment is more positive than negative. Considering the mixed but leaning positive signals from the news and previous analyses, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in the market, particularly in relation to its competitors and the impact of AI on its market share.

While Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services are noted, the company's underwhelming upgrades and increased competition have led to a decline in iPhone sales and market share.

Previous predictions show mixed opinions with a slight tilt towards Apple's potential rise but caution regarding its current valuation and competitive landscape. Considering the overall context and recent trends, Apple's stock price might face some pressure despite its strong fundamentals.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong market position, consistent earnings growth, and potential for future expansion in services and AI. While there are concerns about competition and the mention of better investment opportunities elsewhere, the overall sentiment remains positive. Apple's historical performance and competitive advantages suggest a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. However, the mixed signals regarding alternative investments and competitive pressures temper the bullish outlook slightly. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, with a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive view of Apple, emphasizing its strong market position, consistent earnings, and potential for growth in services and AI. However, it also acknowledges that other investments might offer higher growth potential and that Motley Fool's Stock Advisor didn't include Apple in their top picks. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight decrease in bullish sentiment. While Apple's fundamentals are strong, the article's nuanced perspective and the availability of potentially better opportunities elsewhere temper the enthusiasm. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards from the initial predictions, but still maintaining a positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple.

Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with probabilities of a price rise fluctuating between 0.4 and 0.75 and probabilities of a price fall between 0.25 and 0.6.  Considering the overall positive fundamentals of Apple but acknowledging the potential for better returns elsewhere, and the lack of any significantly negative news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the company's stability and consistent performance. However, the lack of a strong bullish catalyst and the presence of alternative investment options prevent a significantly higher probability for a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is somewhat ambiguous and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.
