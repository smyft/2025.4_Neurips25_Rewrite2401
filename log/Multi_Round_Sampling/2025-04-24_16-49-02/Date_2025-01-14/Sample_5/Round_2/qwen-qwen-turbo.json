(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Prediction: This Will Be Wall Street's First $5 Trillion Company -- and It's Not Nvidia\nNews Content: Change is perhaps the only certainty on Wall Street. Due to factors such as innovation, competition, mergers and acquisitions, bankruptcies, and legal judgments, the puzzle pieces that make up the largest publicly traded companies are constantly in flux.\n\nWhen 2004 came to a close, ExxonMobil was the largest publicly traded company in the S&P 500, with Citigroup and General Electric also in the top 10. Today, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is the only member of the end-of-2004 top 10 that's still among America's largest publicly traded companies.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSince the midpoint of 2023, we've witnessed Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft, and semiconductor colossus Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) all surpass the $3 trillion valuation plateau. Although Nvidia would seem like the surest bet to reach the psychologically important $5 trillion level given the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), a dark-horse candidate may have the clearest path to become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nNvidia is battling against history, which has a flawless track record\n\nOn one hand, there's no denying that Nvidia has enjoyed a textbook operating expansion. The company's Hopper (H100) graphics processing units (GPUs) and successor Blackwell chips have been the preferred options for businesses wanting to run generative AI solutions and train large language models in their high-compute data centers.\n\nWith demand for GPUs overwhelming supply, Nvidia has been able to command $30,000 to $40,000 for its Hopper chip, which is up to four times as much as Advanced Micro Devices has charged customers for its Instinct MI300X GPU. Having otherworldly pricing power helped to push Nvidia's gross margin to as high as 78.4% last year.\n\nWhile the long-term outlook for AI remains encouraging and this technology has real-world applications in most industries around the globe, Nvidia's chances of becoming Wall Street's first $5 trillion company are likely going to be thwarted by history.\n\nRoughly three decades ago, the internet began going mainstream and offered businesses a new way to connect with potential customers. Though the internet did, eventually, alter the growth trajectory for corporate America is a positive way, it took years before businesses really understood how to harness these new sales and marketing channels.\n\nIncluding the internet, every game-changing technology or innovation for 30 years has navigated its way through an early stage bubble. In simpler terms, investors have consistently overestimated how quickly a new technology/innovation would be adopted or gain widespread utility. With most companies lacking clear game plans as to how they'll maximize the return on their AI investments, it sets artificial intelligence up to be the next in a long line of bubbles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince no company has benefited more directly from the AI revolution than Nvidia, the logical expectation is that its stock would be hit the hardest. Historic precedent makes it unlikely that Nvidia ascends to a $5 trillion valuation first.Image source: Amazon.\n\nThis dark-horse candidate has a clear path to become America's largest public company\n\nIf history were to rhyme and the AI bubble bursts, it would also be bad news for Microsoft, which has been investing heavily in an artificial intelligence-driven future. Although Microsoft's operating cash flow isn't as overwhelmingly reliant on AI as Nvidia, being the first to reach a $5 trillion valuation would be a stretch.\n\nThe same can be said for Wall Street's other $3 trillion public company, Apple. Though Apple's Services segment continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, its physical device sales, including iPhone, have stagnated for two years. Apple stock is already trading at one of its priciest valuations in a decade, which leaves little room for its valuation to rise by another $1.4 trillion.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" component that appears to have the clearest path to a $5 trillion market cap is e-commerce juggernaut Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nWhen most consumers and investors hear the Amazon name, they think of its dominant online marketplace. Last February, eMarketer estimated that Amazon would account for just over 40% of U.S. online retail sales in 2024. While this online retail platform has been the face of Amazon for nearly three decades, e-commerce plays a minimal role in terms of cash flow generation and operating income.\n\nThe lion's share of Amazon's growth potential (specifically growth in cash flow) originates from its ancillary operating segments, with Amazon Web Services (AWS) at the front of the pack.\n\nBased on data from tech-analysis firm Canalys, AWS is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform, with an estimated 33% share of total cloud spending during the third quarter of 2024. For context, Amazon's share of spending among cloud-service providers is more than Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud, combined \u2014 and these are the No's 2 and 3 in global cloud-service spending.\n\nEven though AI has played a role in AWS's growth, enterprise spending on cloud services was growing at a steady double-digit pace long before AI became the hottest thing since sliced bread on Wall Street. With enterprise cloud-service spending still in its relatively early stages of expansion, Amazon can expect substantially higher margins from this segment to meaningfully boost its cash flow.\n\nBeyond AWS, Amazon's advertising services and subscription services (e.g., Prime) segments are also respectively growing by double digits. Amazon's push into exclusive sporting events (Thursday Night Football and NBA streaming packages) should improve demand for advertising, as well as support its subscription pricing power.\n\nThe key point is that, unlike Microsoft and Nvidia, Amazon wouldn't be dragged down by the AI bubble bursting thanks to its abundance of other catalysts.\n\nLastly, Amazon remains historically inexpensive. Throughout the 2010s, investors willingly paid 23 to 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of the company. But as of the closing bell on Jan. 10, Amazon's shares are valued at just 13.5 times consensus cash flow for 2026. If Amazon were to reach the median year-end multiple to cash flow it traded at consistently from 2010 through 2019, it would become Wall Street's first $5 trillion company.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong market position, consistent earnings growth, and potential for future expansion in services and AI. Despite some caution regarding its growth compared to younger tech companies, the overall sentiment is positive, suggesting that Apple remains a compelling investment for most investors. The historical performance and competitive advantages further support the likelihood of a stock price rise. However, the mention of alternative investment opportunities may introduce some uncertainty, leading to a lower probability of a significant price drop.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple (AAPL). It highlights Apple's strong competitive advantage, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new areas like AI and services. The article suggests that while Apple may not offer the same explosive growth as smaller companies, it remains a compelling buy for most investors due to its market dominance and future growth potential. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's Stock Advisor team did not include Apple in their list of the 10 best stocks to buy now, suggesting that there might be better opportunities elsewhere. This creates a mixed signal. Considering the overall positive tone regarding Apple's fundamentals and future prospects, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall, but the mention of potentially better opportunities elsewhere tempers the enthusiasm.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong financial performance, including revenue growth, a robust cash position, and significant shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best safe dividend stocks' suggests a positive outlook from the perspective of the article's authors. However, the article also acknowledges that while Apple is a strong company, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  The mention of Apple's underweight position by Parnassus Investments introduces a note of caution.  Overall, the positive aspects of the news outweigh the negative, but the article doesn't present a strong bullish case for significant price appreciation solely based on its dividend prospects. The market's overall sentiment and broader economic factors will likely have a much larger impact on AAPL's price than this article alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is generic and does not provide specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple is primarily known for its technology products, though it has a luxury brand perception due to its premium pricing. Without concrete details linking the news to Apple's financials, products, or market position, the impact on its stock price is uncertain. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned neutrally.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in the market, particularly in relation to its competitors and the impact of AI on its market share. The US government's new regulations on AI chip exports may affect Apple's supply chain and competitive position. However, the article also highlights Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services. Given the mixed implications of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about Apple's competitive position and the potential impact of export restrictions on its AI capabilities.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.'s struggle to regain market share in 2025, particularly in the AI sector. The company has faced underwhelming upgrades and increased competition, leading to a decline in iPhone sales and market share. However, the US government's restrictions on AI chip exports may benefit Apple in the long run by limiting China's access to advanced AI technology. Additionally, Apple's efforts to partner with local players to provide AI features in China may help the company regain some ground. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall impact of the news is likely to be neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that Nvidia might not be the first to reach the $5 trillion valuation, and it might be impacted by the AI bubble. Amazon, on the other hand, is highlighted as having a clearer path to a $5 trillion market cap due to its robust cloud services and other growth segments. The article implies that Apple's valuation is already quite high and growth might be limited.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strong market position, consistent earnings growth, and potential for future expansion in services and AI. While there are concerns about competition and the mention of better investment opportunities elsewhere, the overall sentiment remains positive. Apple's historical performance and competitive advantages suggest a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its strong competitive advantage, consistent earnings growth, and expansion into new areas like AI and services. It suggests that while Apple may not offer the same explosive growth as smaller companies, it remains a compelling buy for most investors due to its market dominance and future growth potential. The mention of Apple Intelligence and its integration into products further reinforces this positive sentiment. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's Stock Advisor team did not include Apple in their list of the 10 best stocks to buy now, suggesting that there might be better opportunities elsewhere. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight decrease in the overall bullish sentiment. Taking all these factors into account, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly downwards from the initial predictions, but still maintaining a positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple's stock. While it highlights Apple's strong financial performance, consistent dividend payments, and large cash reserves,  it also acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in the shorter term.  The inclusion of Apple in a list of 'best safe dividend stocks' is positive, but the relatively low dividend yield (0.42%) and the comparison to potentially higher-growth AI stocks temper the bullish sentiment.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall. Considering the overall positive fundamentals of Apple but acknowledging the potential for better returns elsewhere, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the company's stability and consistent performance, but not a significant one given the context of the article.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is somewhat ambiguous and does not provide specific details about Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, previous predictions from other models indicate a generally positive outlook on Apple's strong market position, consistent earnings growth, and potential for future expansion in services and AI. Some concerns were raised about competition and market share, but the overall sentiment is more positive than negative. Considering the mixed but leaning positive signals from the news and previous analyses, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in the market, particularly in relation to its competitors and the impact of AI on its market share. The US government's new regulations on AI chip exports may have a mixed effect on Apple's supply chain and competitive position.

Previous predictions show mixed opinions with a slight tilt towards Apple's potential rise but caution regarding its current valuation and competitive landscape.
