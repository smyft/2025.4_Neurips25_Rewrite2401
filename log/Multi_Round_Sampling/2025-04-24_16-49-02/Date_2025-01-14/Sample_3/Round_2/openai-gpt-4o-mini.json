(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's 'Made in America' Chips: TSMC Arizona Fab Set to Launch Q1 2025\nNews Content: Following the report on Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM, Financial) will start supplying semiconductors to Apple (AAPL, Financial) in Q1 2025, and it will stay set to begin using the semiconductors manufactured at the Arizona fab. Those processors are being quality verified in the batch of initial processors to be sure they're providing the same quality as TSMC's highest-end chips coming out of Taiwan, Nikkei Asia said. Apple's first major customer for the fab is expected to begin mass production as early as Q1 2025 if testing does not experience any setbacks.\n\nIt is a big step forward for the United States on its journey toward semiconductor independence by cutting reliance on Taiwan a region susceptible to geopolitical tensions with Beijing and natural disaster risks. The Arizona fab is a key move to strengthen U.S. semiconductor supply chains as competition in the industry heats up globally.\n\nThe Arizona facility has led the transition, but other tech giants, such as AMD (AMD, Financial) and Nvidia (NVDA, Financial), are doing test production there, indicating a possible use of locally produced chips. For now, chips manufactured in Arizona are being shipped back to Amkor in Taiwan for packaging until a new facility in Peoria, Arizona, is complete.\n\nLCY Chemical, a supplier now aligned close to an Arizona fab, which had its deployment delayed by about a year due to logistical challenges, is one of those. However, the project highlights the U.S. semiconductor industry's new tide of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities despite these hurdles.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant development that aligns with the trend of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. This move is likely to enhance Apple's supply chain resilience and reduce geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan. The announcement of mass production starting in Q1 2025 suggests a positive long-term outlook for Apple's operational capabilities. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling, as investors may view this as a strategic advantage for Apple in the competitive tech landscape.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is very general and lacks specific information about Apple's involvement or strategy. While Apple products are often considered premium, the headline doesn't directly imply any new initiatives or changes in Apple's business model related to luxury goods. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. There's a slightly higher chance of a small rise due to general positive sentiment towards luxury goods, but a significant movement is unlikely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is too general to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  Apple, while having some high-end products, is not primarily considered a luxury brand in the same vein as companies like LVMH or Herm\u00e8s.  Therefore, this news item is largely irrelevant to Apple's valuation.  The probability of a price change due to this news is extremely low. We assume the market will react based on other factors, and the probability of a rise or fall will be close to the baseline probability based on general market conditions and Apple's own performance indicators.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content are generic and do not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. Without concrete data such as earnings reports, product launches, or market trends, it is difficult to assess the potential movement of the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities are based on the lack of actionable information in the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is neutral and does not provide specific information that would directly influence the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article's content is not provided, but based on the headline alone, it seems to be more of a general inquiry rather than a news piece with specific financial implications. Therefore, it's unlikely to cause a significant immediate impact on the stock price. However, the mention of AAPL being the largest company in the world could be seen as a positive note, potentially leading to a slight increase in investor interest. Given this, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, but both probabilities are close to neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce 'Made in America' chips in Arizona is a positive development for the company, indicating a reduction in reliance on Taiwan and potential geopolitical risks. This move is also seen as a step towards strengthening the US semiconductor supply chain. The fact that other tech giants like AMD and Nvidia are also testing production in Arizona suggests a growing trend of reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities. Given this positive news, it is likely that the stock price of Apple will rise due to increased investor confidence in the company's ability to manage supply chain risks and contribute to the growth of the US semiconductor industry.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that TSMC will start supplying semiconductors to Apple from Q1 2025, marking a significant step towards 'Made in America' chips. This move is likely to enhance Apple's supply chain resilience, reduce geopolitical risks, and support U.S. semiconductor independence. It also suggests that the Arizona fab is on track and could attract more tech companies, which is a positive sign for the broader tech sector. These factors are generally seen positively by investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce chips in Arizona is a significant development that enhances Apple's supply chain resilience and reduces geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan. The move towards 'Made in America' chips aligns with the broader trend of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing, which is likely to be viewed positively by investors. Given the positive implications for Apple's operational capabilities and the potential for increased investor confidence, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Investing in Luxury Stocks' is very general and doesn't provide specific information about Apple's involvement or strategy. While Apple products are often considered premium, the headline doesn't directly imply any new initiatives or changes in Apple's business model related to luxury goods. Most models in the previous round correctly assessed this as neutral news. The models that predicted a rise in stock price were based on a different news article. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. I will assign a slightly higher probability of a small rise due to general positive sentiment towards luxury goods, but a significant movement is unlikely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline \"Investing in Luxury Stocks\" is too generic to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions varied widely, reflecting the lack of direct relevance of the headline to Apple.  Some models incorrectly associated other news (like the TSMC partnership) with the headline, leading to higher rise probabilities.  Given the irrelevance of the headline, the probability of a price change due to this news is extremely low.  The most reasonable prediction is to assume the market will react based on other factors, resulting in probabilities close to 0.5 for both rise and fall.  While Apple is a premium brand, it's not primarily a luxury brand in the same way as LVMH or Herm\u00e8s. Therefore, the news is essentially noise and unlikely to move the stock price significantly.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is neutral and does not provide specific information that would directly influence the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article's content is not provided, but based on the headline alone, it seems to be more of a general inquiry rather than a news piece with specific financial implications. Therefore, it's unlikely to cause a significant immediate impact on the stock price. However, the mention of AAPL being the largest company in the world could be seen as a positive note, potentially leading to a slight increase in investor interest. Given this, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, but both probabilities are close to neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news headline 'Should You Buy Stock in the Largest Company in the World?' is neutral and does not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. The lack of concrete data such as earnings reports, product launches, or market trends makes it difficult to assess the potential movement of the stock price. However, the mention of AAPL being the largest company in the world could be seen as a positive note, potentially leading to a slight increase in investor interest. Considering the neutral nature of the headline and the absence of specific news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling, but both probabilities are close to neutral. The previous predictions from various models also suggest a generally positive outlook but with significant variability in probabilities.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about Apple's partnership with TSMC to produce 'Made in America' chips in Arizona is a significant development that aligns with the trend of reshoring semiconductor manufacturing in the U.S. This move is likely to enhance Apple's supply chain resilience and reduce geopolitical risks associated with reliance on Taiwan. The announcement of mass production starting in Q1 2025 suggests a positive long-term outlook for Apple's operational capabilities. Given these factors, and considering the previous predictions which show a general trend of slightly higher probabilities of the stock price rising, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's collaboration with TSMC to produce semiconductors in the United States, specifically at the Arizona fab. This move signifies a strategic initiative towards enhancing supply chain resilience and reducing geopolitical risks associated with relying on chip production sites in Taiwan. The positive reaction from other tech giants such as AMD and Nvidia, who are also engaging in test production at the Arizona facility, further underscores the significance of this development for the U.S. semiconductor industry. Considering the trend towards reshoring critical manufacturing capabilities, the news is generally viewed favorably by investors, contributing to a higher likelihood of the stock price rising.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
