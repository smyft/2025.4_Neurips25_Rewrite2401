(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and the implications for tech giants like Apple creates uncertainty in the market. If TikTok is banned, Apple may face a decline in app store revenue from TikTok, which could negatively impact its stock price. However, if the situation resolves favorably for TikTok, it could stabilize investor sentiment. Given the mixed signals and potential for regulatory changes, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall due to the immediate uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is generally positive for Apple. Evercore ISI has placed Apple on its Tactical Outperform List with a $250 price target. The analysis points to solid quarterly performance driven by emerging market growth, stable Services and Wearables demand, and potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's chip supply issues. The focus is shifting towards the iPhone 17, which is rumored to have a major redesign, and the upcoming iPhone SE launch, both of which could sustain demand. While there are concerns about iPhone 16 discounts in China, overall demand appears stable due to emerging markets. The article suggests that expectations are already tempered, so Apple only needs to show resilience to keep the stock moving higher. The 'asymmetrically interesting' setup implies more upside potential than downside risk. However, the GuruFocus warning signs should be considered a potential negative factor. Considering all these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding its operations in India.  These challenges include difficulties in transferring staff from China and importing machinery. While this news is potentially negative, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited for several reasons. First, the news focuses on operational challenges, not a fundamental change in Apple's business model or product demand. Second, Apple likely has multiple manufacturing partners and diversification strategies in place to mitigate risks associated with any single supplier. Third, the overall market sentiment towards Apple and the broader tech sector will likely play a more significant role in determining short-term price movements than this specific news. Therefore, the impact is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher probability of a minor negative impact than a positive one, but overall the effect is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a temporary pause in Apple's AI-generated news alerts due to inaccuracy issues, which has drawn complaints from news organizations and campaigners. While this indicates a short-term setback in Apple's AI initiatives, it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on the company's overall financial performance or stock price. Apple's proactive approach to addressing the issues and its reputation for quality and reliability may mitigate negative sentiment. However, the negative publicity and potential reputational damage could lead to minor short-term stock price volatility. Given Apple's strong market position and diversified revenue streams, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low, while the probability of a rise is also modest as the news is not directly tied to financial performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other tech companies is neutral to slightly negative. While TikTok's fate is uncertain, the law requires Apple and other companies to remove TikTok from their app stores, which could lead to a short-term loss of revenue. However, Apple has a diversified business and TikTok's ban is not expected to have a significant long-term impact on the company's financials. The probability of the stock price rising or falling is more related to the overall market sentiment and Apple's own performance rather than this specific news about TikTok.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools to boost enterprise trust and the CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration. Although the news mentions other companies like Apple, the primary focus is on Nvidia. The launch of new AI safety tools is a positive development for Nvidia, indicating innovation and a commitment to improving AI applications. However, the article does not directly impact Apple's stock price. Given the indirect mention of Apple and the lack of significant negative news, the probabilities of the stock price movement for Apple are estimated based on the general market sentiment and the fact that the news does not directly affect Apple's operations or outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The financial news mentions Warren Buffett's recommendation on stocks to buy and hold, but does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, it is unlikely that it would have an immediate impact on the stock price. However, given Warren Buffett's reputation and influence, there could be some indirect positive sentiment affecting Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, as it may impact app store revenues if TikTok is removed. However, the overall sentiment is mixed, with some analysts highlighting Apple's strong fundamentals and potential for growth in other areas. The possibility of regulatory changes under the new administration could also influence market sentiment positively. Given the uncertainty surrounding TikTok and its implications for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to immediate concerns, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's diversified business model may mitigate long-term impacts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news is predominantly positive for Apple. Evercore ISI's 'Tactical Outperform' rating and $250 price target suggest confidence in Apple's near-term performance, driven by emerging markets and stable demand. The potential for market share gains in China due to Huawei's issues is another positive factor. The focus on the iPhone 17 and the upcoming iPhone SE launch indicates strong future demand. The article also mentions that expectations are tempered, meaning Apple doesn't need to exceed expectations significantly to see positive stock movement. The 'asymmetrically interesting' setup further suggests more upside potential. However, the GuruFocus warning signs are a potential negative. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the most recent ones lean slightly positive. Given the overall positive sentiment and the potential for upside, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India is mildly negative for Apple.  While Foxconn is a major assembler, Apple likely has diversified its manufacturing base to mitigate risks from any single supplier. The impact on Apple's stock price is therefore likely to be small.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models highlighting positive factors like strong quarterly performance and others focusing on potential negative impacts from various unrelated news items.  Considering the limited direct impact of the Foxconn news and the overall mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining stable or experiencing a minor fluctuation rather than a significant rise or fall. The muted nature of the news, coupled with Apple's overall strong position, suggests a relatively low impact on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Apple pausing its AI-generated news alerts due to inaccuracy issues is a short-term negative development, but it is unlikely to have a significant long-term impact on Apple's stock price. Apple's proactive approach to addressing the issues and its strong reputation for quality and reliability may mitigate negative sentiment. However, the negative publicity and potential reputational damage could lead to minor short-term stock price volatility. Given Apple's strong market position and diversified revenue streams, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low, while the probability of a rise is also modest as the news is not directly tied to financial performance. Considering the previous predictions, which show a mix of slightly negative to neutral sentiment, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a balanced view with a slight edge towards a negative short-term impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc.

(AAPL). Given Warren Buffett's reputation as a successful investor, his recommendations often carry significant weight among investors. This news might create positive sentiment around Apple, encouraging investors to hold onto the stock longer. However, it's important to consider the previous predictions and reasoning, which suggest mixed sentiments and various influencing factors such as market conditions, product launches, and operational challenges. The overall sentiment leans slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
