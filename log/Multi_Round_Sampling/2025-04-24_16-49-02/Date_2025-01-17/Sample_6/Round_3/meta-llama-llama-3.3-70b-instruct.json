This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and the potential impact of the upcoming Trump administration on semiconductor regulations. While Nvidia's advancements may positively influence the tech sector, the direct impact on Apple Inc. is less clear. However, the mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration could suggest a favorable environment for tech stocks. Given the overall positive sentiment around AI advancements and the potential for reduced regulation, there is a moderate probability that Apple's stock price may rise. Conversely, concerns about tariffs and regulations could negatively impact the stock, but these concerns are more speculative at this stage. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives. While the pause of the AI-generated news alerts feature due to inaccuracies is a negative development, it's framed as a temporary measure to improve the tool. The fact that Apple is actively working on improvements and plans to reintroduce the feature suggests a commitment to AI and a proactive approach to addressing issues. The negative impact is mitigated by the fact that the feature is in beta, and Apple is addressing concerns raised by news organizations. The overall impact is likely to be minor, as the AI news feature is a small part of Apple's overall business. However, the negative publicity and potential damage to Apple's reputation for quality could exert some downward pressure. Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's response, the probability of a significant stock price drop is relatively low. The market's reaction will also depend on broader market trends and investor sentiment towards tech stocks in general.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the ban on TikTok unless it's sold to a non-Chinese entity creates uncertainty for Apple.  The article highlights that the ban would prevent Apple from hosting the TikTok app on its App Store.  While the potential for a sale or a delay in enforcement exists, the immediate risk is the loss of revenue from TikTok's presence on the App Store and the potential for legal penalties if Apple doesn't comply with the ban.  The probability of a stock price fall is higher due to this immediate risk, although the uncertainty surrounding the situation and potential for a resolution (sale, delay) mitigates the potential for a significant drop.  The impact on Apple is likely to be less severe than on companies directly involved in hosting or distributing TikTok, such as Google.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, expectations of a solid quarter driven by emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains due to Huawei's chip supply issues. Additionally, the focus on the upcoming iPhone 17 redesign and iPhone SE launch could sustain demand. The $250 price target and stable gross margins further support a bullish outlook. While there are some concerns about iPhone weakness in China, the overall sentiment is positive, and the article suggests an asymmetrically interesting setup for upside. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with Evercore ISI setting a $250 price target and adding the stock to its Tactical Outperform List. The article highlights emerging market growth, steady demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's chip supply issues. Additionally, anticipation for the iPhone 17 redesign and the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March could keep demand strong. With expectations already tempered, a solid quarterly performance and positive outlook for future products could lead to an increase in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. The stock is up 1.7% since the results. Considering the overall positive earnings report and the current market trend, it is likely that the stock price will continue to rise. However, the article also mentions uncertainty in the market outlook for 2025 due to potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes, which could impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary by a specific date. This scenario could lead to a shift in user base and advertising revenue for platforms currently competing with TikTok, such as Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). As a major player in the mobile app ecosystem, Apple (AAPL) could face a temporary limbo period if TikTok is removed from its app store. However, the long-term impact on AAPL's stock price may not be significantly negative given its diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's advancements in AI safety tools and the potential impact of the upcoming Trump administration on semiconductor regulations. While these developments are significant for Nvidia, the direct implications for Apple Inc. are less clear. The mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration suggests a favorable environment for tech stocks, which could positively influence Apple's stock. However, concerns about potential tariffs and regulations under the new administration could exert downward pressure. Given the mixed signals from the news and the previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, but with a notable chance of a fall due to regulatory concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives.

Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's response, the probability of a significant stock price drop is relatively low. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of fluctuation. I will give a moderate prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok presents a complex scenario for Apple.  While the immediate impact might seem negative due to the potential loss of TikTok from the App Store and associated revenue, the probability of a significant drop is mitigated by several factors.  Firstly, Apple's revenue is highly diversified; the loss of TikTok's presence is unlikely to be catastrophic. Secondly, there's significant uncertainty regarding the actual enforcement of the ban.  Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement, or a sale of TikTok's US operations, could completely negate the negative impact.  The potential for legal challenges further adds to the uncertainty.  Finally, the news focuses heavily on the benefits to competitors like Meta, suggesting a potential redistribution of advertising revenue rather than an overall contraction of the market.  Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term. The long-term impact is even more uncertain and depends heavily on the resolution of the TikTok situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a largely positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Evercore ISI setting a $250 price target and adding the stock to its Tactical Outperform List. Key positive factors include emerging market growth, steady demand for Services and Wearables, potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's chip supply issues, and anticipation for the iPhone 17 redesign and iPhone SE launch. The article suggests that Apple only needs to show resilience in the upcoming quarter to maintain upward momentum. While there are minor concerns about iPhone weakness in China, the overall sentiment is bullish. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a probability of 0.55 or higher for a rise. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc.

However, the long-term impact on AAPL's stock price may not be significantly negative given its diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence. Previous predictions from different models show varying probabilities of stock price movement, but generally, the majority predict a slight to moderate fall in stock price due to the uncertainty introduced by the ban.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's advancements in AI safety tools and the potential impact of the upcoming Trump administration on semiconductor regulations.

This is a negative development as it reflects poorly on Apple's AI capabilities and raises concerns about the reliability of its AI tools. While the issue is being addressed and framed as a temporary setback, it could damage Apple's reputation and investor confidence. The previous predictions are mixed, with some models predicting a rise based on other factors and some predicting a fall based on negative news. Considering the specific news about the AI issue and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple.

The long-term impact is highly uncertain and depends heavily on the resolution of the TikTok situation.  Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a price fall, acknowledging the potential for a relatively small negative impact in the short term, but with significant uncertainty regarding the long-term effects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news presents a largely positive outlook for Apple Inc.
