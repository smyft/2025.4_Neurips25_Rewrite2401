(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and the potential impact of the upcoming Trump administration on semiconductor regulations. While Nvidia's advancements may positively influence the tech sector, the direct impact on Apple Inc. is less clear. However, the mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration could suggest a favorable environment for tech stocks. Given the overall positive sentiment around AI advancements and the potential for reduced regulation, there is a moderate probability that Apple's stock price may rise. Conversely, concerns about tariffs and regulations could negatively impact the stock, but these concerns are more speculative at this stage. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives. While the pause of the AI-generated news alerts feature due to inaccuracies is a negative development, it's framed as a temporary measure to improve the tool. The fact that Apple is actively working on improvements and plans to reintroduce the feature suggests a commitment to AI and a proactive approach to addressing issues. The negative impact is mitigated by the fact that the feature is in beta, and Apple is addressing concerns raised by news organizations. The overall impact is likely to be minor, as the AI news feature is a small part of Apple's overall business. However, the negative publicity and potential damage to Apple's reputation for quality could exert some downward pressure. Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's response, the probability of a significant stock price drop is relatively low. The market's reaction will also depend on broader market trends and investor sentiment towards tech stocks in general.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the ban on TikTok unless it's sold to a non-Chinese entity creates uncertainty for Apple.  The article highlights that the ban would prevent Apple from hosting the TikTok app on its App Store.  While the potential for a sale or a delay in enforcement exists, the immediate risk is the loss of revenue from TikTok's presence on the App Store and the potential for legal penalties if Apple doesn't comply with the ban.  The probability of a stock price fall is higher due to this immediate risk, although the uncertainty surrounding the situation and potential for a resolution (sale, delay) mitigates the potential for a significant drop.  The impact on Apple is likely to be less severe than on companies directly involved in hosting or distributing TikTok, such as Google.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, expectations of a solid quarter driven by emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains due to Huawei's chip supply issues. Additionally, the focus on the upcoming iPhone 17 redesign and iPhone SE launch could sustain demand. The $250 price target and stable gross margins further support a bullish outlook. While there are some concerns about iPhone weakness in China, the overall sentiment is positive, and the article suggests an asymmetrically interesting setup for upside. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with Evercore ISI setting a $250 price target and adding the stock to its Tactical Outperform List. The article highlights emerging market growth, steady demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's chip supply issues. Additionally, anticipation for the iPhone 17 redesign and the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March could keep demand strong. With expectations already tempered, a solid quarterly performance and positive outlook for future products could lead to an increase in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. The stock is up 1.7% since the results. Considering the overall positive earnings report and the current market trend, it is likely that the stock price will continue to rise. However, the article also mentions uncertainty in the market outlook for 2025 due to potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes, which could impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary by a specific date. This scenario could lead to a shift in user base and advertising revenue for platforms currently competing with TikTok, such as Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). As a major player in the mobile app ecosystem, Apple (AAPL) could face a temporary limbo period if TikTok is removed from its app store. However, the long-term impact on AAPL's stock price may not be significantly negative given its diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's advancements in AI safety tools and the potential impact of the upcoming Trump administration on semiconductor regulations. While these developments are significant for Nvidia, the direct implications for Apple Inc. are less clear. The mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration suggests a favorable environment for tech stocks, which could positively influence Apple's stock. However, concerns about potential tariffs and regulations under the new administration could exert downward pressure. Given the mixed signals from the news and the previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, but with a notable chance of a fall due to regulatory concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives.

Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's response, the probability of a significant stock price drop is relatively low. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of fluctuation. I will give a moderate prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok presents a complex scenario for Apple.  While the immediate impact might seem negative due to the potential loss of TikTok from the App Store and associated revenue, the probability of a significant drop is mitigated by several factors.  Firstly, Apple's revenue is highly diversified; the loss of TikTok's presence is unlikely to be catastrophic. Secondly, there's significant uncertainty regarding the actual enforcement of the ban.  Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement, or a sale of TikTok's US operations, could completely negate the negative impact.  The potential for legal challenges further adds to the uncertainty.  Finally, the news focuses heavily on the benefits to competitors like Meta, suggesting a potential redistribution of advertising revenue rather than an overall contraction of the market.  Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term. The long-term impact is even more uncertain and depends heavily on the resolution of the TikTok situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a largely positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Evercore ISI setting a $250 price target and adding the stock to its Tactical Outperform List. Key positive factors include emerging market growth, steady demand for Services and Wearables, potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's chip supply issues, and anticipation for the iPhone 17 redesign and iPhone SE launch. The article suggests that Apple only needs to show resilience in the upcoming quarter to maintain upward momentum. While there are minor concerns about iPhone weakness in China, the overall sentiment is bullish. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a probability of 0.55 or higher for a rise. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc.

While the issue is being addressed and framed as a temporary setback, it could damage Apple's reputation and investor confidence. The previous predictions are mixed, with some models predicting a rise based on other factors and some predicting a fall based on negative news. Considering the specific news about the AI issue and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple.
