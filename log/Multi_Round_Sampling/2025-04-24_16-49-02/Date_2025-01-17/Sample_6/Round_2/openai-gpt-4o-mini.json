His tenure has triggered concerns about forthcoming semiconductor rules and regulations, including fears of possible tariffs on Mexico and China.\n\nRecently, Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang criticized the Biden administration\u2019s latest AI technology regulations against countries like China and Russia.\n\nNvidia chief\u00a0Jensen Huang\u00a0will likely miss the inauguration of Trump\u00a0on January 20 due to his routine East Asia\u00a0tour at this time of the year, rendering him unable to attend any prior inauguration ever, Bloomberg cites unnamed sources familiar with the matter.\n\nBig Tech giant leaders, including Apple Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u00a0Tim Cook, Amazon.com Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Tesla Inc\u2019s (NASDAQ:TSLA)\u00a0Elon Musk, will grace the occasion next week.\n\nHuang also told Bloomberg he expected Trump to bring less regulation.\n\nAlso, on Thursday, Nvidia launched three new NIM microservices to help enterprises bring additional control and safety measures to their AI agents.\n\nThe offerings are part of \u00a0Nvidia NeMo Guardrails, an open-source collection of software tools and microservices designed to help companies improve their AI applications.\n\nNeMo Guardrails helps developers integrate and manage AI guardrails in large language model (LLM) applications.\n\nAlso Read: Microsoft Launches CoreAI Division: Ex-Meta Exec To Supercharge Copilot And AI Innovations\n\nAmdocs, Cerence AI, and Lowe\u2019s leveraged NeMo Guardrails to safeguard AI applications.\n\nBy being deployed in customer service across the automotive, finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail industries, the agents can boost customer satisfaction and trust.\n\nNvidia stock surged over 138% in the last 12 months.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's new AI safety tools and the potential impact of the upcoming Trump administration on semiconductor regulations. While Nvidia's advancements may positively influence the tech sector, the direct impact on Apple Inc. is less clear. However, the mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration could suggest a favorable environment for tech stocks. Given the overall positive sentiment around AI advancements and the potential for reduced regulation, there is a moderate probability that Apple's stock price may rise. Conversely, concerns about tariffs and regulations could negatively impact the stock, but these concerns are more speculative at this stage. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives. While the pause of the AI-generated news alerts feature due to inaccuracies is a negative development, it's framed as a temporary measure to improve the tool. The fact that Apple is actively working on improvements and plans to reintroduce the feature suggests a commitment to AI and a proactive approach to addressing issues. The negative impact is mitigated by the fact that the feature is in beta, and Apple is addressing concerns raised by news organizations. The overall impact is likely to be minor, as the AI news feature is a small part of Apple's overall business. However, the negative publicity and potential damage to Apple's reputation for quality could exert some downward pressure. Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's response, the probability of a significant stock price drop is relatively low. The market's reaction will also depend on broader market trends and investor sentiment towards tech stocks in general.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the ban on TikTok unless it's sold to a non-Chinese entity creates uncertainty for Apple.  The article highlights that the ban would prevent Apple from hosting the TikTok app on its App Store.  While the potential for a sale or a delay in enforcement exists, the immediate risk is the loss of revenue from TikTok's presence on the App Store and the potential for legal penalties if Apple doesn't comply with the ban.  The probability of a stock price fall is higher due to this immediate risk, although the uncertainty surrounding the situation and potential for a resolution (sale, delay) mitigates the potential for a significant drop.  The impact on Apple is likely to be less severe than on companies directly involved in hosting or distributing TikTok, such as Google.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights several positive factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, expectations of a solid quarter driven by emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains due to Huawei's chip supply issues. Additionally, the focus on the upcoming iPhone 17 redesign and iPhone SE launch could sustain demand. The $250 price target and stable gross margins further support a bullish outlook. While there are some concerns about iPhone weakness in China, the overall sentiment is positive, and the article suggests an asymmetrically interesting setup for upside. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with Evercore ISI setting a $250 price target and adding the stock to its Tactical Outperform List. The article highlights emerging market growth, steady demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's chip supply issues. Additionally, anticipation for the iPhone 17 redesign and the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March could keep demand strong. With expectations already tempered, a solid quarterly performance and positive outlook for future products could lead to an increase in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Q3 earnings of various consumer electronics companies, including Apple (AAPL). Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. The stock is up 1.7% since the results. Considering the overall positive earnings report and the current market trend, it is likely that the stock price will continue to rise. However, the article also mentions uncertainty in the market outlook for 2025 due to potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes, which could impact the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the uncertainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the US unless it is sold to a non-adversary by a specific date. This scenario could lead to a shift in user base and advertising revenue for platforms currently competing with TikTok, such as Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). As a major player in the mobile app ecosystem, Apple (AAPL) could face a temporary limbo period if TikTok is removed from its app store. However, the long-term impact on AAPL's stock price may not be significantly negative given its diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's advancements in AI safety tools and the potential impact of the upcoming Trump administration on semiconductor regulations. While these developments are significant for Nvidia, the direct implications for Apple Inc. are less clear. The mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration suggests a favorable environment for tech stocks, which could positively influence Apple's stock. However, concerns about potential tariffs and regulations under the new administration could exert downward pressure. Given the mixed signals from the news and the previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, but with a notable chance of a fall due to regulatory concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives.

Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's response, the probability of a significant stock price drop is relatively low. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of fluctuation. I will give a moderate prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok presents a complex scenario for Apple.  While the immediate impact might seem negative due to the potential loss of TikTok from the App Store and associated revenue, the probability of a significant drop is mitigated by several factors.  Firstly, Apple's revenue is highly diversified; the loss of TikTok's presence is unlikely to be catastrophic. Secondly, there's significant uncertainty regarding the actual enforcement of the ban.  Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement, or a sale of TikTok's US operations, could completely negate the negative impact.  The potential for legal challenges further adds to the uncertainty.  Finally, the news focuses heavily on the benefits to competitors like Meta, suggesting a potential redistribution of advertising revenue rather than an overall contraction of the market.  Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term. The long-term impact is even more uncertain and depends heavily on the resolution of the TikTok situation.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a largely positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Evercore ISI setting a $250 price target and adding the stock to its Tactical Outperform List. Key positive factors include emerging market growth, steady demand for Services and Wearables, potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's chip supply issues, and anticipation for the iPhone 17 redesign and iPhone SE launch. The article suggests that Apple only needs to show resilience in the upcoming quarter to maintain upward momentum. While there are minor concerns about iPhone weakness in China, the overall sentiment is bullish. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models assigning a probability of 0.55 or higher for a rise. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc.

Previous predictions from different models show varying probabilities of stock price movement, but generally, the majority predict a slight to moderate fall in stock price due to the uncertainty introduced by the ban.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
