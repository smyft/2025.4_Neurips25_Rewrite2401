(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Microsoft\u2019s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. While the removal of TikTok may lead to a shift in user engagement and advertising revenue towards competitors like Instagram and YouTube, it also raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their potential impact on its stock. While the article doesn't directly discuss Apple, the 'Tech Chart of the Day' section mentions Apple's recent stock performance, noting a 4% drop due to concerns about iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Although Apple rose 1.3% on Friday, the overall sentiment is slightly negative due to these concerns. Therefore, the probability of a further fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding its operations in India.  These challenges include difficulties in transferring staff from China and importing machinery. While this news is potentially negative, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited for several reasons. First, the news focuses on operational challenges, not a fundamental change in Apple's business model or product demand. Second, Apple likely has multiple manufacturing partners and diversification strategies in place to mitigate risks associated with any single supplier. Third, the overall market sentiment towards Apple and the broader tech sector will likely play a more significant role in determining short-term price movements than this specific news. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is considered low.  The probability of a price rise is also low, as the news is not inherently positive. The most likely scenario is that the news will have a minimal impact on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an increase in EPS and revenue compared to the previous year. The consensus rating for Apple is 'Buy' with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors might not find the stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors might be deterred by the low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) is neutral to slightly negative for Apple. The ban primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance rather than Apple directly. However, Apple's role as a distributor of TikTok through its App Store means it must comply with the law, potentially leading to a loss of revenue from TikTok. The news does not provide any direct positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative impact, albeit limited, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's production and supply chain, leading to a negative impact on the company's stock price. However, the news is not extremely severe, and Apple has diversified manufacturing partners and a strong brand reputation, which could mitigate the negative effects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and the absence of its CEO at Trump's inauguration. It touches on broader industry trends and regulations but does not directly impact Apple Inc. The article shows a positive outlook for Nvidia but does not provide direct information about Apple's business metrics or market sentiment towards it.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
