A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. While the removal of TikTok may lead to a shift in user engagement and advertising revenue towards competitors like Instagram and YouTube, it also raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their potential impact on its stock. While the article doesn't directly discuss Apple, the 'Tech Chart of the Day' section mentions Apple's recent stock performance, noting a 4% drop due to concerns about iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Although Apple rose 1.3% on Friday, the overall sentiment is slightly negative due to these concerns. Therefore, the probability of a further fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding its operations in India.  These challenges include difficulties in transferring staff from China and importing machinery. While this news is potentially negative, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited for several reasons. First, the news focuses on operational challenges, not a fundamental change in Apple's business model or product demand. Second, Apple likely has multiple manufacturing partners and diversification strategies in place to mitigate risks associated with any single supplier. Third, the overall market sentiment towards Apple and the broader tech sector will likely play a more significant role in determining short-term price movements than this specific news. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is considered low.  The probability of a price rise is also low, as the news is not inherently positive. The most likely scenario is that the news will have a minimal impact on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an increase in EPS and revenue compared to the previous year. The consensus rating for Apple is 'Buy' with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors might not find the stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors might be deterred by the low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) is neutral to slightly negative for Apple. The ban primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance rather than Apple directly. However, Apple's role as a distributor of TikTok through its App Store means it must comply with the law, potentially leading to a loss of revenue from TikTok. The news does not provide any direct positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative impact, albeit limited, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's production and supply chain, leading to a negative impact on the company's stock price. However, the news is not extremely severe, and Apple has diversified manufacturing partners and a strong brand reputation, which could mitigate the negative effects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and the absence of its CEO at Trump's inauguration. It touches on broader industry trends and regulations but does not directly impact Apple Inc. The article shows a positive outlook for Nvidia but does not provide direct information about Apple's business metrics or market sentiment towards it.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
