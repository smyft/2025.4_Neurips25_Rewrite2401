(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Jan. 19\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. While the removal of TikTok may lead to a shift in user engagement and advertising revenue towards competitors like Instagram and YouTube, it also raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their potential impact on its stock. While the article doesn't directly discuss Apple, the 'Tech Chart of the Day' section mentions Apple's recent stock performance, noting a 4% drop due to concerns about iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Although Apple rose 1.3% on Friday, the overall sentiment is slightly negative due to these concerns. Therefore, the probability of a further fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding its operations in India.  These challenges include difficulties in transferring staff from China and importing machinery. While this news is potentially negative, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited for several reasons. First, the news focuses on operational challenges, not a fundamental change in Apple's business model or product demand. Second, Apple likely has multiple manufacturing partners and diversification strategies in place to mitigate risks associated with any single supplier. Third, the overall market sentiment towards Apple and the broader tech sector will likely play a more significant role in determining short-term price movements than this specific news. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is considered low.  The probability of a price rise is also low, as the news is not inherently positive. The most likely scenario is that the news will have a minimal impact on the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings, with Wall Street analysts expecting an increase in EPS and revenue compared to the previous year. The consensus rating for Apple is 'Buy' with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article notes that growth-focused investors might not find the stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors might be deterred by the low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) is neutral to slightly negative for Apple. The ban primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance rather than Apple directly. However, Apple's role as a distributor of TikTok through its App Store means it must comply with the law, potentially leading to a loss of revenue from TikTok. The news does not provide any direct positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative impact, albeit limited, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's production and supply chain, leading to a negative impact on the company's stock price. However, the news is not extremely severe, and Apple has diversified manufacturing partners and a strong brand reputation, which could mitigate the negative effects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and the absence of its CEO at Trump's inauguration. It touches on broader industry trends and regulations but does not directly impact Apple Inc. The article shows a positive outlook for Nvidia but does not provide direct information about Apple's business metrics or market sentiment towards it.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US introduces significant uncertainty for Apple Inc. While the ban primarily affects TikTok, it raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store. This could lead to a loss of revenue from TikTok and a shift in user engagement towards competitors like Instagram and YouTube. The overall sentiment appears to be negative due to the uncertainty surrounding the legal implications and potential revenue loss. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The primary news focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their potential impact on its stock. While this doesn't directly concern Apple, the 'Tech Chart of the Day' section mentions Apple's recent 4% stock drop due to concerns about iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Although Apple recovered slightly with a 1.3% rise on Friday, the overall sentiment remains somewhat negative. The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a fall and others towards a rise. Considering the negative pressure on Apple due to iPhone sales concerns and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a higher probability of a fall, but not drastically so, as the Friday rise indicates some resilience.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India is mildly negative for Apple.  While it's a supply chain issue, Apple likely has mitigation strategies in place given its size and diversification. The impact is likely to be small, and the overall market sentiment and other factors will likely outweigh this specific news in the short term.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall and others seeing a more neutral or even slightly positive outlook. Considering the limited impact of this news and the uncertainty reflected in previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining stable or experiencing a minor fluctuation rather than a significant rise or fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years.

Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm. Considering the previous predictions, which show a mix of opinions but lean slightly towards a negative impact, the probability of a rise is adjusted to reflect a balanced view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) is neutral to slightly negative for Apple. While the ban primarily affects TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, it also raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. However, the direct impact on Apple's business is limited, and the company has a diversified portfolio of products and services. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a decline due to the potential loss of revenue from TikTok and the uncertainty surrounding the app's future availability.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news regarding Foxconn's challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China may have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, considering Apple's diversified manufacturing partners and strong brand reputation, the negative effects are likely to be mitigated. The previous predictions from other models show a mixed trend, but most of them indicate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the limited information provided in the news headline and considering the potential offsetting factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Nvidia and its initiatives in AI safety tools and the absence of its CEO at Trump's inauguration. This news does not directly address Apple Inc.'s business metrics or market conditions. While Nvidia's advancements in AI could have indirect positive impacts on the tech sector, the specific news lacks direct implications for Apple's immediate stock price movement. The previous predictions suggest varied sentiments about Apple's stock price, ranging from slightly negative to positive. Considering the limited direct impact on Apple and weighing the mixed sentiments, the probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price remains relatively moderate.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US introduces significant uncertainty for Apple Inc. While the ban primarily affects TikTok, it raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store. This could lead to a loss of revenue from TikTok and a shift in user engagement towards competitors like Instagram and YouTube. The overall sentiment appears to be negative due to the uncertainty surrounding the legal implications and potential revenue loss. Previous predictions from various models indicate a higher probability of stock price decline, reflecting investor concerns about the implications of the TikTok ban and its impact on Apple's business. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The primary news focuses on Microsoft's AI investments and their potential impact on its stock.

Considering the negative pressure on Apple due to iPhone sales concerns and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a higher probability of a fall, but not drastically so, as the Friday rise indicates some resilience. Also, the fact that Microsoft is struggling with AI adoption might indirectly benefit Apple, as it reduces competitive pressure.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Foxconn's challenges in India is mildly negative for Apple, but the impact is likely to be limited. Apple likely has diversification strategies to mitigate risks associated with a single supplier.  The news itself doesn't represent a fundamental shift in Apple's business or product demand.  Previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities of a price rise ranging from 0.1 to 0.65 and probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.2 to 0.65.  The lack of detail in the premium news article prevents a definitive assessment. Considering the limited impact of the Foxconn news and the wide range of previous predictions, I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability to both a rise and a fall.  The overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will likely have a much larger influence on Apple's stock price than this specific news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance with significant returns over the past 10 years and upcoming earnings expectations that are positive, with Wall Street analysts forecasting an increase in EPS and revenue.
