If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone.

Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key partner for Apple, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production capabilities, leading to concerns about future revenue and operational efficiency. As a result, the market may react negatively to this news, increasing the probability of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand and market position may mitigate some of the negative impact, leading to a lower probability of a significant rise in stock price. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance, highlighting the significant returns an investor would have realized over the past 10 years. While this information is positive and showcases Apple's long-term growth potential, it doesn't directly impact the immediate short-term stock price. The article also mentions upcoming earnings with expected growth in EPS and revenue, which is a positive indicator. However, it also notes that the stock may not be attractive to growth or income-focused investors due to a modest dividend yield and limited upside potential based on analyst price targets. Considering these factors, the positive historical performance and expected earnings growth are somewhat offset by the limited short-term upside and modest dividend yield. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its expanded partnership with Apple Pay, offering a 'Pay Later' option.  While this is positive for SYF, the news is about a *partner* company, not Apple (AAPL) directly.  The article doesn't suggest any direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.  Therefore, the likelihood of this news significantly affecting Apple's stock price is low. Any price movement would likely be due to broader market factors or other news unrelated to this announcement.  The probability of a price rise or fall is therefore close to random chance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings expectations, which are positive with an expected EPS increase and revenue growth. Analysts have a 'Buy' rating with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article also notes that the stock may not appeal to growth-focused or income-focused investors due to modest upside potential and low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield may temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, is likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. The company's performance in China is a significant contributor to its overall revenue, and a decline in sales in this region may lead to a decrease in investor confidence. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is a crucial market for Apple. This decline has led to a reduction in market share and negative market sentiment. Given these factors, it is likely that the stock price will experience downward pressure.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key partner for Apple, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This situation could disrupt Apple's supply chain and production capabilities, raising concerns about potential impacts on revenue and operational efficiency. While Apple's strong brand and historical performance may provide some support, the immediate implications of supply chain disruptions are likely to weigh more heavily on investor sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's impressive historical performance, showcasing the significant returns an investor would have realized over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming Q1 2025 earnings with expected growth in EPS and revenue, which are positive indicators. The article highlights a 'Buy' rating from analysts with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, it also notes that the stock may not be attractive to growth or income-focused investors due to a modest dividend yield and limited upside potential. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on negative aspects like supply chain issues or sales decline in China, while others emphasized the positive historical performance and earnings expectations. Given the positive historical performance, expected earnings growth, and analyst ratings, I believe the stock is slightly more likely to rise. However, the limited upside potential and modest dividend yield temper the enthusiasm, and the previous rounds' negative predictions suggest some underlying concerns. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its enhanced Apple Pay integration, offering a 'Pay Later' option. This is positive for SYF, but the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely minimal.  The announcement doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or operations.  Therefore, the probability of this news significantly influencing Apple's stock price is low. Any price movement would probably be due to broader market trends or other unrelated news.  Considering the previous predictions which range widely and often focus on unrelated news, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change due to the lack of direct relevance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance and upcoming earnings, which are expected to show growth in EPS and revenue. Analysts have a 'Buy' rating with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article also notes that the stock may not appeal to growth-focused or income-focused investors due to modest upside potential and low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield may temper enthusiasm. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline '2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold Through 2025 and Beyond' is generally positive as it implies that Apple is one of the stocks recommended by Warren Buffett for long-term holding. Historically, Warren Buffett's endorsements have positively influenced stock prices due to his reputation and track record. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's future performance or any direct impact on its operations. Considering the positive implication of being a Warren Buffett-recommended stock and assuming no other negative news, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. But given that the news does not provide direct actionable information about Apple's future performance, the impact is likely moderate.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales.

The company's performance in China is a significant contributor to its overall revenue, and a decline in sales in this region may lead to a decrease in investor confidence. Considering the previous predictions, most models agree that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising, with some models estimating a higher probability of a fall due to the significant decline in sales and loss of market share. Therefore, based on the news and the trend of previous predictions, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued decline in iPhone sales in China, where Apple has faced significant competition from local brands like Huawei and Vivo. This trend is likely to negatively impact investor confidence and potentially affect Apple's overall revenue and market share. Previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling due to similar concerns. Although Apple's brand and market position might mitigate some adverse effects, the current news signals a deteriorating situation in a key market for the company, which typically leads to a negative stock reaction.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key partner for Apple, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China.

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on negative aspects like supply chain issues or sales decline in China (though these are from different news articles), while others emphasized the positive historical performance and earnings expectations. The current article is primarily positive, focusing on past returns and expected earnings growth. Given this, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article also points out limitations in growth potential and dividend yield. The previous rounds' negative predictions, while based on different news, suggest some underlying concerns that temper the optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its enhanced Apple Pay integration, offering a 'Pay Later' option. This is positive for SYF, but the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely minimal. The announcement doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or operations.  Therefore, the probability of this news significantly influencing Apple's stock price is low. Any price movement would probably be due to broader market trends or other unrelated news.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the lack of direct impact of this news on AAPL.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the wide range of previous predictions, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change due to the lack of direct relevance.  The probabilities are adjusted slightly to reflect the overall market sentiment and the possibility of minor indirect effects.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's historical performance over the past 10 years, highlighting significant returns for investors.
