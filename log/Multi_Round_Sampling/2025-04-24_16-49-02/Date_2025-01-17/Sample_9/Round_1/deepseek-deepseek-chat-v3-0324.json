If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Apple also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nApple's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Foxconn, a key partner for Apple, is facing challenges in sending staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production capabilities, leading to concerns about future revenue and operational efficiency. As a result, the market may react negatively to this news, increasing the probability of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand and market position may mitigate some of the negative impact, leading to a lower probability of a significant rise in stock price. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher likelihood of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance, highlighting the significant returns an investor would have realized over the past 10 years. While this information is positive and showcases Apple's long-term growth potential, it doesn't directly impact the immediate short-term stock price. The article also mentions upcoming earnings with expected growth in EPS and revenue, which is a positive indicator. However, it also notes that the stock may not be attractive to growth or income-focused investors due to a modest dividend yield and limited upside potential based on analyst price targets. Considering these factors, the positive historical performance and expected earnings growth are somewhat offset by the limited short-term upside and modest dividend yield. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its expanded partnership with Apple Pay, offering a 'Pay Later' option.  While this is positive for SYF, the news is about a *partner* company, not Apple (AAPL) directly.  The article doesn't suggest any direct impact on Apple's financials or operations.  Therefore, the likelihood of this news significantly affecting Apple's stock price is low. Any price movement would likely be due to broader market factors or other news unrelated to this announcement.  The probability of a price rise or fall is therefore close to random chance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong historical performance, with a significant return on investment over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming earnings expectations, which are positive with an expected EPS increase and revenue growth. Analysts have a 'Buy' rating with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article also notes that the stock may not appeal to growth-focused or income-focused investors due to modest upside potential and low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the stock is more likely to rise, but the limited upside and low dividend yield may temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, is likely to have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. The company's performance in China is a significant contributor to its overall revenue, and a decline in sales in this region may lead to a decrease in investor confidence. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a significant decline in iPhone sales in China, which is a crucial market for Apple. This decline has led to a reduction in market share and negative market sentiment. Given these factors, it is likely that the stock price will experience downward pressure.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
