(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Arizona Setbacks: TSMC Struggles With U.S. Regulations While Prioritizing Taiwan's Chip Leadership\nNews Content: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. The fact that Apple has slipped to third place in smartphone sales in China could raise concerns among investors about its competitive position. However, the slight rebound suggests that the market may have already priced in some of this negative news, and there may be optimism regarding upcoming quarterly earnings. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a significant chance of it falling due to the underlying concerns about sales performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article provides a mixed view of Apple (AAPL). While Apple's Q3 revenue and operating income exceeded expectations, the overall consumer electronics sector faces challenges from technological change. Apple's stock has already risen 1.7% since the earnings release, suggesting some positive sentiment is already priced in. The broader market update mentions potential uncertainty in 2025 due to future rate cuts and potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes. Given the positive earnings beat, but also the potential headwinds and the fact that the stock has already seen a slight increase, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a further rise, but also acknowledging the risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on TSMC's challenges in expanding its Arizona plant, citing regulatory hurdles and labor shortages.  While TSMC produces chips for Apple, the news is indirect and doesn't directly impact Apple's financials or operations. The delays in TSMC's Arizona plant might lead to some minor supply chain concerns in the long term, but the impact on Apple is likely to be minimal, especially considering TSMC's reassurance about the Arizona facility's quality and its commitment to prioritizing Taiwan for its most advanced technology.  The news is more relevant to TSMC's stock price than Apple's.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low, with a slightly higher chance of a minor negative impact due to potential, albeit indirect, supply chain concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there is a reported steep drop in iPhone sales in China, causing Apple to slip to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings, which is a negative indicator. On the other hand, the stock rebounded slightly after this news, suggesting some resilience or possibly priced-in expectations. Additionally, upcoming quarterly earnings and concerns over proposed Trump tariffs add uncertainty. Given the competing factors, the probability of a rise or fall is balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative sentiment due to the sales slump.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Synchrony Financial's (SYF) recent announcement to offer Apple Pay's Pay Later feature to its eligible cardholders, providing them with greater flexibility and convenience at checkout. This development is expected to boost the company's purchasing power and attract new customers, potentially leading to increased interest and fees on loans. Given SYF's strong digital and analytics expertise, as well as its partnerships with leading retailers, the introduction of this feature is likely to have a positive impact on the company's stock performance. Additionally, SYF's share price has gained 89.6% in the past year, outperforming the industry's growth. However, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which might indicate a neutral or slightly positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the partnership between Synchrony Financial (SYF) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) to offer the Pay Later feature on Apple Pay. This feature provides customers with greater flexibility and choice at checkout, potentially increasing purchasing power and driving growth in interest and fees on loans for SYF. The article also highlights SYF's strong digital and analytics expertise, as well as its reputation and growth prospects. However, the article does not provide a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Considering the positive implications of the partnership for SYF and the lack of direct impact on AAPL, I estimate the probability of AAPL's stock price rising due to this news as moderate, while the probability of the stock price falling is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential disruptions to the TikTok app due to regulatory issues, which may affect its availability on Apple's App Store. While the news primarily impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, it could indirectly influence Apple's stock price if the situation leads to public concern or regulatory scrutiny affecting the broader tech sector. However, Apple itself is not directly involved in the sale or divestiture of TikTok, and the company's core business of hardware and software ecosystems remains intact.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While TSMC is a key supplier, the delays are not immediately catastrophic. TSMC assures quality and prioritizes Taiwan for advanced chips, mitigating immediate supply chain risks for Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some highlighting potential negative impacts from other news (China sales, general market uncertainty), while others see a potential for positive movement. The TSMC news is likely to have a minimal impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the indirect nature of the TSMC news on Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome (no significant change) than a rise or fall.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the overall positive sentiment around Apple in some of the previous predictions, despite the negative news about China sales.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Arizona Setbacks: TSMC Struggles With U.S. Regulations While Prioritizing Taiwan's Chip Leadership\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.48,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.42\n}\n```\n"
