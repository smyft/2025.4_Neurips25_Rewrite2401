(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. The fact that Apple has slipped to third place in smartphone sales in China could raise concerns among investors about its competitive position. However, the slight rebound suggests that the market may have already priced in some of this negative news, and there may be optimism regarding upcoming quarterly earnings. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a significant chance of it falling due to the underlying concerns about sales performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article provides a mixed view of Apple (AAPL). While Apple's Q3 revenue and operating income exceeded expectations, the overall consumer electronics sector faces challenges from technological change. Apple's stock has already risen 1.7% since the earnings release, suggesting some positive sentiment is already priced in. The broader market update mentions potential uncertainty in 2025 due to future rate cuts and potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes. Given the positive earnings beat, but also the potential headwinds and the fact that the stock has already seen a slight increase, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a further rise, but also acknowledging the risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on TSMC's challenges in expanding its Arizona plant, citing regulatory hurdles and labor shortages.  While TSMC produces chips for Apple, the news is indirect and doesn't directly impact Apple's financials or operations. The delays in TSMC's Arizona plant might lead to some minor supply chain concerns in the long term, but the impact on Apple is likely to be minimal, especially considering TSMC's reassurance about the Arizona facility's quality and its commitment to prioritizing Taiwan for its most advanced technology.  The news is more relevant to TSMC's stock price than Apple's.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly due to this news is low, with a slightly higher chance of a minor negative impact due to potential, albeit indirect, supply chain concerns.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there is a reported steep drop in iPhone sales in China, causing Apple to slip to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings, which is a negative indicator. On the other hand, the stock rebounded slightly after this news, suggesting some resilience or possibly priced-in expectations. Additionally, upcoming quarterly earnings and concerns over proposed Trump tariffs add uncertainty. Given the competing factors, the probability of a rise or fall is balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative sentiment due to the sales slump.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Synchrony Financial's (SYF) recent announcement to offer Apple Pay's Pay Later feature to its eligible cardholders, providing them with greater flexibility and convenience at checkout. This development is expected to boost the company's purchasing power and attract new customers, potentially leading to increased interest and fees on loans. Given SYF's strong digital and analytics expertise, as well as its partnerships with leading retailers, the introduction of this feature is likely to have a positive impact on the company's stock performance. Additionally, SYF's share price has gained 89.6% in the past year, outperforming the industry's growth. However, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), which might indicate a neutral or slightly positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses the partnership between Synchrony Financial (SYF) and Apple Inc. (AAPL) to offer the Pay Later feature on Apple Pay. This feature provides customers with greater flexibility and choice at checkout, potentially increasing purchasing power and driving growth in interest and fees on loans for SYF. The article also highlights SYF's strong digital and analytics expertise, as well as its reputation and growth prospects. However, the article does not provide a direct impact on AAPL's stock price. Considering the positive implications of the partnership for SYF and the lack of direct impact on AAPL, I estimate the probability of AAPL's stock price rising due to this news as moderate, while the probability of the stock price falling is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential disruptions to the TikTok app due to regulatory issues, which may affect its availability on Apple's App Store. While the news primarily impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, it could indirectly influence Apple's stock price if the situation leads to public concern or regulatory scrutiny affecting the broader tech sector. However, Apple itself is not directly involved in the sale or divestiture of TikTok, and the company's core business of hardware and software ecosystems remains intact.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. The fact that Apple has slipped to third place in smartphone sales in China raises concerns about its competitive position. However, the slight rebound suggests that the market may have already priced in some of this negative news, and there may be optimism regarding upcoming quarterly earnings. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a significant chance of it falling due to the underlying concerns about sales performance.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news article offers a mixed perspective on Apple (AAPL). While Apple's Q3 revenue and operating income exceeded expectations, the overall consumer electronics sector faces challenges from technological change. Apple's stock has already risen 1.7% since the earnings release, suggesting some positive sentiment is already priced in. The broader market update mentions potential uncertainty in 2025 due to future rate cuts and potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight tilt towards a more conservative outlook. Some models highlighted the positive earnings beat, while others focused on potential headwinds and the fact that the stock has already seen a slight increase. Given the mixed signals and the already priced-in positive sentiment, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a further rise, but also acknowledging the risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on TSMC's Arizona plant delays, indirectly impacting Apple. While TSMC is a key supplier, the delays are not immediately catastrophic. TSMC assures quality and prioritizes Taiwan for advanced chips, mitigating immediate supply chain risks for Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some highlighting potential negative impacts from other news (China sales, general market uncertainty), while others see a potential for positive movement. The TSMC news is likely to have a minimal impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the indirect nature of the TSMC news on Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome (no significant change) than a rise or fall.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the overall positive sentiment around Apple in some of the previous predictions, despite the negative news about China sales.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline reports a rebound in Apple's stock despite a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, where Apple has slipped to third place in smartphone sales rankings. This suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news, leading to a slight rebound. However, the underlying concerns about sales performance and competition in China, coupled with upcoming quarterly earnings and potential trade policy uncertainties, create a mixed sentiment. Previous predictions also reflect this mixed outlook, with probabilities slightly favoring a rise or fall depending on the model. Considering the rebound as a potential short-term reaction and the ongoing challenges, the probabilities are balanced but with a slight tilt towards a negative impact due to the sales slump and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Synchrony Financial's (SYF) recent announcement to offer Apple Pay's Pay Later feature to its eligible cardholders.

Considering the positive implications of the partnership for SYF and the lack of direct impact on AAPL, I estimate the probability of AAPL's stock price rising due to this news as moderate. The overall sentiment seems neutral to slightly positive for AAPL, given that the news does not introduce significant negative factors directly affecting Apple's business.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Synchrony Financial's (SYF) recent announcement to offer Apple Pay's Pay Later feature to its eligible cardholders, providing them with greater flexibility and convenience at checkout.
