      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok ban: Where will the app's revenue and 170M users go?\nNews Content: The US Supreme Court ruled to uphold the law banning TikTok in the US unless the company sells to a non-adversary by January 19. If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban. Kulkarni suggests that money \"would just follow the waterfall of the market share.\" Related Videos\n\n03:51\n\nCould Trump save TikTok as Supreme Court decision looms?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago 03:13\n\nTikTok ban is 'parallel' to Trump's earlier Huawei concerns\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 05:25\n\nMicrosoft unveils updated CoPilot for enterprise customers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:38\n\nTikTok calls reports of sale to Elon Musk 'pure fiction'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nIn particular, he posits, \"Google and Facebook [are] the biggest market share companies; most likely, advertisers would probably take that money away from TikTok and go back to those two.\"\n\n\"The reality is that Apple and Google will likely remove TikTok from the app store, which means in the next month or so, users are going to be in a limbo, advertisers are going to be in a limbo,\" Kulkarni explains.\n\nAdditionally, Kulkarni suggests Trump could use TikTok as leverage in US-China negotiations.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. The slight rebound suggests that investors may be reacting positively to the overall market sentiment or other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports. However, the decline in sales and loss of market position to competitors like Huawei and Vivo could weigh on investor sentiment. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a notable chance of it falling due to the negative sales report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives due to inaccuracies in its news summarization tool. While this isn't a major product recall or a fundamental flaw in their core business, it does highlight potential challenges in their AI development and deployment. The negative impact is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the feature is in beta, Apple is addressing the issue, and the summarization feature is optional. However, the negative publicity and concerns raised by news organizations and press freedom groups could create a slight negative sentiment. Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's proactive response, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is low, but a slight dip is possible. The overall market conditions and other news related to Apple will also play a role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's impressive past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting a significant return on investment. While this is positive, it's primarily historical data and doesn't directly predict future price movements.  The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the modest analyst price target and the lack of significant new information driving a substantial price change, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small rise due to the positive earnings report and analyst sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Microsoft's struggles and investments in AI, which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it mentions Apple's recent stock performance, noting a 4% drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Given this context, the news does not provide a strong positive catalyst for Apple's stock. The mention of Apple's decline and broader market concerns suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications for the tech industry could have indirect effects on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The main concern is that if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might create a short-term uncertainty for Apple. However, given that TikTok's revenue and user base are not directly attributed to Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal. The major beneficiaries of TikTok's potential ban are expected to be other social media platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). Apple's stock price movement is more likely to be influenced by other factors, and this news might not have a significant direct impact. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a neutral or positive outlook due to the minimal direct impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's production and supply chain, leading to a negative impact on the company's stock price. However, the news is not extremely severe, and Apple has diversified manufacturing partners and a strong brand reputation, which could mitigate the negative effects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential shift in advertisement spending towards competitors of TikTok, such as Meta (META) and YouTube, if TikTok faces a ban. As Apple (AAPL) does not directly compete with TikTok in the same market space, the news might not have a direct negative impact on AAPL. However, it could indirectly influence investor sentiment towards growth and tech stocks in general. The overall market reaction and specific investor behavior will determine the exact impact.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
