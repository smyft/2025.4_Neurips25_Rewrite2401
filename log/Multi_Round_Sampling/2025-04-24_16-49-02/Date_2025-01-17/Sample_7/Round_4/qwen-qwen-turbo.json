(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for the company. The slight rebound suggests that investors may be reacting positively to the overall market sentiment or other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports. However, the decline in sales and loss of market position to competitors like Huawei and Vivo could weigh on investor sentiment. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a notable chance of it falling due to the negative sales report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a temporary setback for Apple's AI initiatives due to inaccuracies in its news summarization tool. While this isn't a major product recall or a fundamental flaw in their core business, it does highlight potential challenges in their AI development and deployment. The negative impact is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the feature is in beta, Apple is addressing the issue, and the summarization feature is optional. However, the negative publicity and concerns raised by news organizations and press freedom groups could create a slight negative sentiment. Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's proactive response, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is low, but a slight dip is possible. The overall market conditions and other news related to Apple will also play a role.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's impressive past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting a significant return on investment. While this is positive, it's primarily historical data and doesn't directly predict future price movements.  The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the modest analyst price target and the lack of significant new information driving a substantial price change, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small rise due to the positive earnings report and analyst sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Microsoft's struggles and investments in AI, which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it mentions Apple's recent stock performance, noting a 4% drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Given this context, the news does not provide a strong positive catalyst for Apple's stock. The mention of Apple's decline and broader market concerns suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications for the tech industry could have indirect effects on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The main concern is that if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might create a short-term uncertainty for Apple. However, given that TikTok's revenue and user base are not directly attributed to Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal. The major beneficiaries of TikTok's potential ban are expected to be other social media platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). Apple's stock price movement is more likely to be influenced by other factors, and this news might not have a significant direct impact. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a neutral or positive outlook due to the minimal direct impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's production and supply chain, leading to a negative impact on the company's stock price. However, the news is not extremely severe, and Apple has diversified manufacturing partners and a strong brand reputation, which could mitigate the negative effects. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates a potential shift in advertisement spending towards competitors of TikTok, such as Meta (META) and YouTube, if TikTok faces a ban. As Apple (AAPL) does not directly compete with TikTok in the same market space, the news might not have a direct negative impact on AAPL. However, it could indirectly influence investor sentiment towards growth and tech stocks in general. The overall market reaction and specific investor behavior will determine the exact impact.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a slight rebound in Apple's stock despite a reported slump in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for the company.

However, the feature is in beta, Apple is addressing the issue, and the summarization feature is optional, which mitigates the negative impact. Concerns raised by news organizations and press freedom groups could create a slight negative sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of slightly negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is low, but a slight dip is possible.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news article is primarily a retrospective analysis of Apple's stock performance over the past 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it offers little predictive power for future price movements. The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, suggesting a modest 4% upside. This, combined with a low dividend yield (0.43%), indicates limited appeal to growth or income-focused investors.  Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but this is already factored into the current price. The lack of significant new information, coupled with the modest analyst target and the historical nature of the main content, suggests a low probability of significant price movement in either direction. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects. Considering the overall information, a slightly higher probability of a small price increase is assigned due to the positive earnings report and analyst sentiment, but the overall probability of significant change is low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Microsoft's AI investments and stock performance, with only a brief mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) regarding a 4% drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. This suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the broader market sentiment and other factors not covered in the news could influence the stock. Given the mixed signals and the lack of strong positive catalysts, the probabilities are balanced with a slight edge towards a potential fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for the tech industry.

(AAPL). The news suggests that TikTok's potential downfall could redistribute advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META) and YouTube, potentially benefiting these companies at the expense of TikTok. Since Apple operates in a different market segment, the direct impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal. However, the broader implications of shifts in digital advertising revenue and potential changes in consumer behavior could create some market uncertainty.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of slightly negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is low, but a slight dip is possible.

While this is positive, it doesn't offer strong predictive power for future price movements. The analyst consensus price target of $245.17 suggests a modest 4% upside, but this is a relatively small potential gain.  The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income-focused investors.

The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects.
