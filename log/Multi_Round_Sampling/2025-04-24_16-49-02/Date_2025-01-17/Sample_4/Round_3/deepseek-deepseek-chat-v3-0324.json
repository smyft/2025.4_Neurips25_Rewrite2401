(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and its implications for tech giants like Apple creates uncertainty in the market. While Apple may not be directly affected by the ban itself, the removal of TikTok from its app store could impact user engagement and app ecosystem dynamics. Additionally, the potential for legal complications and the involvement of political figures like Trump could create volatility. Given these factors, there is a moderate probability of a stock price decline due to the uncertainty and potential negative sentiment surrounding the tech sector.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple Pay through increased flexibility offered by Synchrony Financial's Pay Later feature. This could lead to increased Apple Pay adoption and usage, potentially boosting Apple's revenue. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate as Apple Pay is just one of many revenue streams for Apple. The news primarily benefits Synchrony Financial. The article focuses more on SYF than AAPL. Therefore, the positive impact on AAPL is likely to be small. Given the overall market conditions and other factors influencing Apple's stock, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential ban of TikTok from US app stores on January 19th.  This directly impacts Apple, as it would be legally required to remove TikTok from its App Store. While the article mentions several potential scenarios, including a delay or sale of TikTok, the immediate impact is the potential loss of revenue from TikTok's presence on the App Store.  The uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for legal challenges adds to the risk.  However, the overall impact on Apple's vast business is likely to be relatively small, considering its diverse revenue streams.  The probability of a significant stock price movement is therefore low, with a slightly higher chance of a minor negative impact due to the immediate removal of TikTok from the App Store, if it happens.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the US ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face operational challenges as it would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially affecting its service revenue. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple indirectly by reducing competition in the social media space, possibly leading to increased usage of other apps available on Apple devices. Additionally, the uncertainty around enforcement and potential executive actions by President-elect Trump adds complexity. Overall, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive, given its diversified revenue streams and the potential for increased engagement on other platforms.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news about Synchrony Financial (SYF) introducing the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay for its eligible cardholders could have a positive impact on the company's stock price. The introduction of this feature provides greater flexibility and choice to customers, potentially increasing the usage and popularity of Synchrony's credit cards. This move could lead to increased interest and fees on loans, which is a primary revenue source for SYF. Additionally, the partnership with Apple and the integration of Apple Pay with Synchrony's credit cards could enhance customer experience, leading to increased loyalty and spending. However, the stock's performance also depends on various other factors such as overall market conditions, competition, and the company's ability to manage risks associated with its lending business. The recent performance of SYF, with shares gaining 89.6% in the past year, indicates a strong growth trajectory. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for SYF and the positive outlook for its earnings and revenue growth suggest that the stock might have a stable or positive movement in the near term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc., with a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, a solid quarter expected, and emerging market growth. The potential for a major redesign with the iPhone 17 and the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March could keep demand strong. Additionally, Apple's ability to gain market share due to Huawei's chip supply issues and the overall stable demand for iPhones despite some discounts in China contribute to the positive sentiment. The article concludes that the setup looks 'asymmetrically interesting' for investors looking for upside, implying a higher potential for the stock price to rise than to fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok and its implications for Apple creates a complex scenario. While Apple is not directly responsible for TikTok's operations, the requirement to remove the app from its App Store could lead to a decrease in user engagement and app ecosystem dynamics. The uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the ban and the potential for political intervention adds to the volatility. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and the possibility of increased engagement on other platforms may mitigate the negative impact. Overall, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight inclination towards a stock price decline due to the immediate implications of the TikTok ban.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive development for Apple Pay through increased flexibility offered by Synchrony Financial's Pay Later feature.

The immediate negative impact is the potential loss of revenue from TikTok's presence on the App Store and the associated operational challenges of removing it. However, this impact is likely to be relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue streams.  The uncertainty surrounding the situation and potential legal challenges could create market volatility, but the possibility of a delay or sale of TikTok, or even President-elect Trump's potential intervention, mitigates the negative impact.  Furthermore, the removal of TikTok could potentially lead to increased usage of other apps on Apple's platform. Considering the diverse revenue streams of Apple and the various potential outcomes, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is relatively low. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  Given the relatively small direct impact on Apple and the potential for mitigating factors, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a minor price increase due to the overall market conditions and Apple's strong financial position, rather than a significant drop.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the Supreme Court upholding the US ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner has mixed implications for Apple Inc.

Additionally, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong market position mitigate some of the negative impacts. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price decline is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate given Apple's resilience and the broader market context.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Synchrony Financial (SYF) offering greater flexibility with Apple Pay's Pay Later feature, which is more directly related to SYF than AAPL. However, the increased flexibility and payment options could potentially boost Apple Pay usage, thereby indirectly benefiting Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple Pay is just one of many revenue streams for Apple and the news primarily focuses on SYF, the direct impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be moderate. The overall market conditions and other factors influencing Apple's stock will play a more significant role. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article presents a positive outlook for Apple Inc., with a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, a solid quarter expected, and emerging market growth.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism about Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of a rise. However, it's essential to note that the stock market can be volatile, and various factors can influence the stock price. Based on the analysis, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations.

However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis. Considering the mixed signals and the historical performance of Apple, along with the diversification of its revenue streams, the overall impact on Apple's stock price appears to be moderate.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok and its implications for Apple creates a complex scenario.

While this is a positive development for SYF, its impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect. Increased Apple Pay adoption could slightly boost Apple's revenue, but Apple Pay is just one of many revenue streams. The previous round of predictions shows a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning slightly towards a positive impact. Considering the limited direct impact on Apple and the overall market conditions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not significantly so. The trend of previous predictions also shows a slight increase in optimism.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple.  While the direct impact on Apple's revenue from losing TikTok from its App Store is likely relatively small compared to its overall revenue streams, the uncertainty surrounding the situation and potential legal challenges could create market volatility.  The possibility of a delay, sale of TikTok, or President-elect Trump's intervention are mitigating factors.  Furthermore, the removal of TikTok could potentially lead to increased usage of other apps on Apple's platform.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong financial position, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is relatively low.  However, the immediate negative impact of removing TikTok, coupled with the general uncertainty, slightly favors a higher probability of a minor price decrease.  The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the immediate uncertainty and potential for negative market reaction, but the impact is likely to be short-lived and relatively small given Apple's overall strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about the Supreme Court upholding the US ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner has mixed implications for Apple Inc.
