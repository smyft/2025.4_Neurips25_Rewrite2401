If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Apple also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nApple's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and its implications for tech giants like Apple creates uncertainty in the market. While Apple may not be directly affected by the ban itself, the potential for decreased app downloads and updates could impact user engagement and revenue from the App Store. Additionally, the involvement of political figures like Trump adds further unpredictability. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline due to the negative sentiment surrounding regulatory risks and potential impacts on revenue streams.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential negative publicity if it removes TikTok from its app store, potentially impacting user sentiment and brand image. This could lead to a slight negative impact on the stock. On the other hand, the removal of TikTok could indirectly benefit Apple by increasing user engagement and app downloads for competing platforms available on the App Store, potentially driving revenue. However, this benefit is indirect and less certain. The analyst's comments highlight the uncertainty and potential limbo period for users and advertisers, which could create short-term volatility. Given these factors, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely to be slightly negative or neutral in the short term. The negative sentiment associated with potential legal risks and the uncertainty surrounding the transition of users and ad revenue outweigh the potential indirect benefits.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's impressive past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting a substantial return on investment. While this is positive, it's primarily historical data and doesn't directly predict future price movements.  The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the relatively low projected upside and the lack of significant new information driving a substantial price change, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small increase due to the analyst price target.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there is a reported steep drop in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for Apple, leading to a slip in rankings behind competitors like Huawei and Vivo. This negative news could pressure the stock. On the other hand, the stock rebounded slightly after the report, suggesting some resilience or perhaps investor optimism ahead of the upcoming quarterly earnings report. The rebound might also indicate that the market had already priced in the sales slump or that other factors (e.g., broader market trends, earnings anticipation) are outweighing the negative news. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative impact due to the sales slump.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which is directed by Greta Gerwig. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it mentions Apple in the context of allowing movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services, similar to Netflix's recent actions. Since the news does not provide any specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively, we can infer that the impact on AAPL is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, given that Netflix and other streaming services are investing in exclusive content and theatrical releases, it could imply a competitive landscape for Apple TV+, which might have a slightly negative implication for AAPL in the long run if Apple TV+ fails to keep up with similar strategies. But based on the information given, the probabilities are more aligned with a neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news. However, Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may help mitigate the impact of this decline. Therefore, while the probability of a stock price fall is higher, it is not a certainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok and its implications for tech giants like Apple introduces significant uncertainty. While Apple may not be directly impacted by the ban itself, the potential for decreased app downloads and updates could negatively affect user engagement and revenue from the App Store. The involvement of political figures and the possibility of legal challenges add to the unpredictability. Given these factors, the overall sentiment leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decline due to regulatory risks and potential impacts on revenue streams.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). While Apple doesn't directly benefit from TikTok's revenue, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could create a negative perception and potentially lead to user dissatisfaction. The analyst's comments highlight the uncertainty and potential limbo period for users and advertisers, which could create short-term volatility. The previous rounds of predictions show a generally negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty surrounding the TikTok ban. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is primarily a retrospective analysis of Apple's stock performance over the past 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it offers little predictive power for future price movements. The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, suggesting a modest 4% upside. This is a mildly bullish signal, but not strong enough to significantly influence the probability of a price rise.  The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income investors. Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive. However, the overall lack of significant new information impacting Apple's fundamentals makes a substantial price change unlikely in the short term. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock prices. Considering the limited predictive value of the news and the modest analyst target, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports a steep drop in iPhone sales in China, with Apple slipping to third place behind Huawei and Vivo. This is a significant negative indicator for Apple, as China is a major market for iPhone sales. However, the stock rebounded slightly after the report, suggesting some investor resilience or anticipation of the upcoming quarterly earnings. Given the mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative impact due to the sales slump. The slight rebound might be due to short-term optimism or other factors, but the underlying sales decline is a strong negative signal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia'.

This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. Considering the previous predictions, most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The decline in sales and loss of market share are significant indicators of potential financial impact. While Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may help mitigate the impact of this decline, the overall trend suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news regarding the potential ban on TikTok and its implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL) creates significant uncertainty. While the direct impact on Apple may be limited since the company is more focused on hardware and services rather than the app itself, there is a concern about potential regulatory risks and the impact on user engagement and revenue streams from the App Store. The mixed signals from various predictions suggest a cautious approach. Previous predictions indicate a higher probability of a stock price decline due to regulatory risks and the potential for negative sentiment. However, considering Apple's strong brand and diversified product offerings, the impact may not be severe.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok introduces significant uncertainty for Apple Inc.

However, the stock rebounded slightly after the report, suggesting some investor resilience or anticipation of the upcoming quarterly earnings. Previous predictions from other models generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the sales slump, though some models noted the rebound as a mitigating factor.
