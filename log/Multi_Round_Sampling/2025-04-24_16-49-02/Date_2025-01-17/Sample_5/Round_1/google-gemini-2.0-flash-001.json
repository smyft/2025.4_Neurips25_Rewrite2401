      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok ban: Where will the app's revenue and 170M users go?\nNews Content: The US Supreme Court ruled to uphold the law banning TikTok in the US unless the company sells to a non-adversary by January 19. If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban. Kulkarni suggests that money \"would just follow the waterfall of the market share.\" Related Videos\n\n03:51\n\nCould Trump save TikTok as Supreme Court decision looms?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago 03:13\n\nTikTok ban is 'parallel' to Trump's earlier Huawei concerns\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 05:25\n\nMicrosoft unveils updated CoPilot for enterprise customers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:38\n\nTikTok calls reports of sale to Elon Musk 'pure fiction'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nIn particular, he posits, \"Google and Facebook [are] the biggest market share companies; most likely, advertisers would probably take that money away from TikTok and go back to those two.\"\n\n\"The reality is that Apple and Google will likely remove TikTok from the app store, which means in the next month or so, users are going to be in a limbo, advertisers are going to be in a limbo,\" Kulkarni explains.\n\nAdditionally, Kulkarni suggests Trump could use TikTok as leverage in US-China negotiations.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and its implications for tech giants like Apple creates uncertainty in the market. While Apple may not be directly affected by the ban itself, the potential for decreased app downloads and updates could impact user engagement and revenue from the App Store. Additionally, the involvement of political figures like Trump adds further unpredictability. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline due to the negative sentiment surrounding regulatory risks and potential impacts on revenue streams.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential negative publicity if it removes TikTok from its app store, potentially impacting user sentiment and brand image. This could lead to a slight negative impact on the stock. On the other hand, the removal of TikTok could indirectly benefit Apple by increasing user engagement and app downloads for competing platforms available on the App Store, potentially driving revenue. However, this benefit is indirect and less certain. The analyst's comments highlight the uncertainty and potential limbo period for users and advertisers, which could create short-term volatility. Given these factors, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely to be slightly negative or neutral in the short term. The negative sentiment associated with potential legal risks and the uncertainty surrounding the transition of users and ad revenue outweigh the potential indirect benefits.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's impressive past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting a substantial return on investment. While this is positive, it's primarily historical data and doesn't directly predict future price movements.  The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the relatively low projected upside and the lack of significant new information driving a substantial price change, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small increase due to the analyst price target.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there is a reported steep drop in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for Apple, leading to a slip in rankings behind competitors like Huawei and Vivo. This negative news could pressure the stock. On the other hand, the stock rebounded slightly after the report, suggesting some resilience or perhaps investor optimism ahead of the upcoming quarterly earnings report. The rebound might also indicate that the market had already priced in the sales slump or that other factors (e.g., broader market trends, earnings anticipation) are outweighing the negative news. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative impact due to the sales slump.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which is directed by Greta Gerwig. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it mentions Apple in the context of allowing movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services, similar to Netflix's recent actions. Since the news does not provide any specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively, we can infer that the impact on AAPL is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, given that Netflix and other streaming services are investing in exclusive content and theatrical releases, it could imply a competitive landscape for Apple TV+, which might have a slightly negative implication for AAPL in the long run if Apple TV+ fails to keep up with similar strategies. But based on the information given, the probabilities are more aligned with a neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news. However, Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may help mitigate the impact of this decline. Therefore, while the probability of a stock price fall is higher, it is not a certainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
