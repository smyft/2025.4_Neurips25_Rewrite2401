(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Jan. 19\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding TikTok's potential ban and its implications for tech giants like Apple creates uncertainty in the market. While Apple may not be directly affected by the ban itself, the potential for decreased app downloads and updates could impact user engagement and revenue from the App Store. Additionally, the involvement of political figures like Trump adds further unpredictability. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of a stock price decline due to the negative sentiment surrounding regulatory risks and potential impacts on revenue streams.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential negative publicity if it removes TikTok from its app store, potentially impacting user sentiment and brand image. This could lead to a slight negative impact on the stock. On the other hand, the removal of TikTok could indirectly benefit Apple by increasing user engagement and app downloads for competing platforms available on the App Store, potentially driving revenue. However, this benefit is indirect and less certain. The analyst's comments highlight the uncertainty and potential limbo period for users and advertisers, which could create short-term volatility. Given these factors, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely to be slightly negative or neutral in the short term. The negative sentiment associated with potential legal risks and the uncertainty surrounding the transition of users and ad revenue outweigh the potential indirect benefits.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Apple's impressive past performance over the last 10 years, highlighting a substantial return on investment. While this is positive, it's primarily historical data and doesn't directly predict future price movements.  The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the relatively low projected upside and the lack of significant new information driving a substantial price change, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small increase due to the analyst price target.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a mixed scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there is a reported steep drop in iPhone sales in China, which is a significant market for Apple, leading to a slip in rankings behind competitors like Huawei and Vivo. This negative news could pressure the stock. On the other hand, the stock rebounded slightly after the report, suggesting some resilience or perhaps investor optimism ahead of the upcoming quarterly earnings report. The rebound might also indicate that the market had already priced in the sales slump or that other factors (e.g., broader market trends, earnings anticipation) are outweighing the negative news. Given these mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative impact due to the sales slump.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia', which is directed by Greta Gerwig. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, it mentions Apple in the context of allowing movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services, similar to Netflix's recent actions. Since the news does not provide any specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively, we can infer that the impact on AAPL is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, given that Netflix and other streaming services are investing in exclusive content and theatrical releases, it could imply a competitive landscape for Apple TV+, which might have a slightly negative implication for AAPL in the long run if Apple TV+ fails to keep up with similar strategies. But based on the information given, the probabilities are more aligned with a neutral stance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news. However, Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may help mitigate the impact of this decline. Therefore, while the probability of a stock price fall is higher, it is not a certainty.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok and its implications for tech giants like Apple introduces significant uncertainty. While Apple may not be directly impacted by the ban itself, the potential for decreased app downloads and updates could negatively affect user engagement and revenue from the App Store. The involvement of political figures and the possibility of legal challenges add to the unpredictability. Given these factors, the overall sentiment leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decline due to regulatory risks and potential impacts on revenue streams.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). While Apple doesn't directly benefit from TikTok's revenue, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could create a negative perception and potentially lead to user dissatisfaction. The analyst's comments highlight the uncertainty and potential limbo period for users and advertisers, which could create short-term volatility. The previous rounds of predictions show a generally negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty surrounding the TikTok ban. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article is primarily a retrospective analysis of Apple's stock performance over the past 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it offers little predictive power for future price movements. The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, suggesting a modest 4% upside. This is a mildly bullish signal, but not strong enough to significantly influence the probability of a price rise.  The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income investors. Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive. However, the overall lack of significant new information impacting Apple's fundamentals makes a substantial price change unlikely in the short term. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock prices.

This is a significant negative indicator for Apple, as China is a major market for iPhone sales. However, the stock rebounded slightly after the report, suggesting some investor resilience or anticipation of the upcoming quarterly earnings. Given the mixed signals, the probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative impact due to the sales slump. The slight rebound might be due to short-term optimism or other factors, but the underlying sales decline is a strong negative signal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses a deal between IMAX and Netflix for the exclusive theatrical release of 'Narnia'.

This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. Considering the previous predictions, most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The decline in sales and loss of market share are significant indicators of potential financial impact. While Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may help mitigate the impact of this decline, the overall trend suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news regarding the potential ban on TikTok and its implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL) creates significant uncertainty. While the direct impact on Apple may be limited since the company is more focused on hardware and services rather than the app itself, there is a concern about potential regulatory risks and the impact on user engagement and revenue streams from the App Store.
