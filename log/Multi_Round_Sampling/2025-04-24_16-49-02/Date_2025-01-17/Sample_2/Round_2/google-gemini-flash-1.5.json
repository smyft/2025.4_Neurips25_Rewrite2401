(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock rebounds after report of iPhone sales slump in China\nNews Content: Apple's (AAPL) stock rebounded slightly Friday morning after Canalys reported a steep drop in iPhone sales in China, prompting Apple to slip to third place in Chinese smartphone sales rankings behind Huawei and Vivo.\n\nMorning Brief hosts Brad Smith and Seana Smith detail Big Tech's concerns over proposed Trump tariffs and persistent competition from Asian manufacturer, as Apple plans to report quarterly earnings on Thursday, January 30.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n01:26\n\nApple stock falls after losing top smartphone spot in China: RPT\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:25\n\nApple's global iPhone sales decline 5% in holiday quarter: Report\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 4 days ago 06:55\n\nInvestors should 'get excited' about Meta if TikTok is banned\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:45\n\nBill Gates and Donald Trump Had a Three-Hour Dinner\n\nWSJ \u2022 1 hour ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 6.1%, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite being labeled as the weakest performer among its peers, the stock has seen a modest increase of 1.7% since the earnings announcement. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, as indicated by the average 1.4% rise in stock prices of peers, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the market's cautious outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance of the stock price rising, the potential for a decline remains due to broader market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the ban itself doesn't directly harm Apple. In fact, it could be argued that it indirectly benefits Apple as it removes a competitor from the app store and potentially increases usage of other apps on iOS devices. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. The article mentions that Apple could face legal dilemmas if Trump delays enforcement of the law. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment. The article also mentions that Apple and Google could face penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, a key market for Apple. This is negative news and would typically lead to a stock price decline. However, the headline also mentions a slight rebound in the stock price *after* the initial report. This suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports.  The mention of Trump tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty.  The rebound suggests the market's reaction is not solely driven by the China sales slump.  Given the mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, which could significantly impact the stock price regardless of the China sales figures, predicting a definitive price movement is difficult.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the negative sales data but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to other market factors and the potential for positive earnings news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. However, the extent of the impact depends on how quickly Foxconn can resolve these issues and whether Apple has alternative suppliers or contingency plans in place. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative impact on production, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news discusses Microsoft's AI investments and the potential impact on its stock price. However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The information about Microsoft's AI spending and its stock performance does not have a direct correlation with Apple's stock price movement. Apple's recent stock performance has been influenced by concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, as mentioned in the article. Given that the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, we should consider the probabilities of stock price movement based on the context provided. Apple's stock has already faced downward pressure due to its own issues, and without any directly related negative news, the probability of a further fall might be relatively lower compared to a rise, which is speculative without a clear positive catalyst.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in some of this decline, and the actual impact on the stock price may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 6.1%, which exceeded analysts' expectations, indicating a solid performance despite being labeled the weakest among its peers. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, with an average rise of 1.4% in peer stock prices, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the cautious market outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the potential for a decline due to broader market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Supreme Court upholding a potential TikTok ban in the US, which has indirect implications for Apple. While Apple isn't directly targeted, the ban affects its App Store and could create legal dilemmas if enforcement is delayed. The article suggests that Apple could face penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions that the ban could benefit Meta and YouTube, which are competitors to TikTok. The uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment towards Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture.  A decline in iPhone sales in China is undeniably negative, and several previous models correctly pointed out the potential for a stock price drop due to this. However, the headline also notes a slight rebound after the initial report. This suggests the market may have already partially priced in the bad news, or that other factors are at play.  The upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard; strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative China sales data.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  While the China sales slump is a concern, the rebound and upcoming earnings report make a definitive prediction difficult.  I'm leaning slightly towards a rise, acknowledging the risk of a fall, but giving more weight to the potential for positive earnings news to offset the negative sales data and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news already.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, potentially leading to delays or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. While the extent of the impact depends on Foxconn's ability to resolve these issues and Apple's contingency plans, the uncertainty and potential for negative impact on production suggest downward pressure on the stock price. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure due to this news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content primarily focus on Microsoft's AI investments and stock performance, which does not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article mentions that Apple fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop since August, due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Given that the news does not provide any directly related information about Apple's future performance, we must consider the context of Apple's recent stock performance and market concerns. Apple's stock has been under pressure due to its own issues, and without any directly related negative news, the probability of a further fall might be relatively lower compared to a rise, which is speculative without a clear positive catalyst. Considering the overall market sentiment and the lack of direct correlation between Microsoft's AI investments and Apple's stock performance, I estimate the probabilities based on the existing market concerns and potential for rebound.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall due to this news. However, the market's reaction may be limited as it may have already factored in some of this decline. The overall sentiment from the previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models assigning a probability of stock price fall as high as 0.8. Given this information, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis. Considering the mixed signals, the historical performance of Apple, and the conflicting opinions of previous predictions, the stock price movement is uncertain.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
