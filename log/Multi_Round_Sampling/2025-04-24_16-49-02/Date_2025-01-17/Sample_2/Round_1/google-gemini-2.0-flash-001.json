(AAPL)\nNews Headline: TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban\nNews Content: The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 6.1%, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite being labeled as the weakest performer among its peers, the stock has seen a modest increase of 1.7% since the earnings announcement. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, as indicated by the average 1.4% rise in stock prices of peers, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the market's cautious outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance of the stock price rising, the potential for a decline remains due to broader market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the ban itself doesn't directly harm Apple. In fact, it could be argued that it indirectly benefits Apple as it removes a competitor from the app store and potentially increases usage of other apps on iOS devices. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. The article mentions that Apple could face legal dilemmas if Trump delays enforcement of the law. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment. The article also mentions that Apple and Google could face penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, a key market for Apple. This is negative news and would typically lead to a stock price decline. However, the headline also mentions a slight rebound in the stock price *after* the initial report. This suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports.  The mention of Trump tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty.  The rebound suggests the market's reaction is not solely driven by the China sales slump.  Given the mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, which could significantly impact the stock price regardless of the China sales figures, predicting a definitive price movement is difficult.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the negative sales data but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to other market factors and the potential for positive earnings news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. However, the extent of the impact depends on how quickly Foxconn can resolve these issues and whether Apple has alternative suppliers or contingency plans in place. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative impact on production, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news discusses Microsoft's AI investments and the potential impact on its stock price. However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The information about Microsoft's AI spending and its stock performance does not have a direct correlation with Apple's stock price movement. Apple's recent stock performance has been influenced by concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, as mentioned in the article. Given that the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, we should consider the probabilities of stock price movement based on the context provided. Apple's stock has already faced downward pressure due to its own issues, and without any directly related negative news, the probability of a further fall might be relatively lower compared to a rise, which is speculative without a clear positive catalyst.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in some of this decline, and the actual impact on the stock price may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
