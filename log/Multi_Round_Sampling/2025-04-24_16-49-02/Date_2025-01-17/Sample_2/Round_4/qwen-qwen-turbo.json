      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: What could happen to your TikTok app on Jan. 19\nNews Content: What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 6.1%, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite being labeled as the weakest performer among its peers, the stock has seen a modest increase of 1.7% since the earnings announcement. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, as indicated by the average 1.4% rise in stock prices of peers, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the market's cautious outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance of the stock price rising, the potential for a decline remains due to broader market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the ban itself doesn't directly harm Apple. In fact, it could be argued that it indirectly benefits Apple as it removes a competitor from the app store and potentially increases usage of other apps on iOS devices. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. The article mentions that Apple could face legal dilemmas if Trump delays enforcement of the law. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment. The article also mentions that Apple and Google could face penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, a key market for Apple. This is negative news and would typically lead to a stock price decline. However, the headline also mentions a slight rebound in the stock price *after* the initial report. This suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports.  The mention of Trump tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty.  The rebound suggests the market's reaction is not solely driven by the China sales slump.  Given the mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, which could significantly impact the stock price regardless of the China sales figures, predicting a definitive price movement is difficult.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the negative sales data but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to other market factors and the potential for positive earnings news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. However, the extent of the impact depends on how quickly Foxconn can resolve these issues and whether Apple has alternative suppliers or contingency plans in place. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative impact on production, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news discusses Microsoft's AI investments and the potential impact on its stock price. However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The information about Microsoft's AI spending and its stock performance does not have a direct correlation with Apple's stock price movement. Apple's recent stock performance has been influenced by concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, as mentioned in the article. Given that the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, we should consider the probabilities of stock price movement based on the context provided. Apple's stock has already faced downward pressure due to its own issues, and without any directly related negative news, the probability of a further fall might be relatively lower compared to a rise, which is speculative without a clear positive catalyst.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in some of this decline, and the actual impact on the stock price may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 6.1%, which exceeded analysts' expectations, indicating a solid performance despite being labeled the weakest among its peers. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, with an average rise of 1.4% in peer stock prices, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the cautious market outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the potential for a decline due to broader market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Supreme Court upholding a potential TikTok ban in the US, which has indirect implications for Apple. While Apple isn't directly targeted, the ban affects its App Store and could create legal dilemmas if enforcement is delayed. The article suggests that Apple could face penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions that the ban could benefit Meta and YouTube, which are competitors to TikTok. The uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment towards Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture.  A decline in iPhone sales in China is undeniably negative, and several previous models correctly pointed out the potential for a stock price drop due to this. However, the headline also notes a slight rebound after the initial report. This suggests the market may have already partially priced in the bad news, or that other factors are at play.  The upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard; strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative China sales data.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  While the China sales slump is a concern, the rebound and upcoming earnings report make a definitive prediction difficult.  I'm leaning slightly towards a rise, acknowledging the risk of a fall, but giving more weight to the potential for positive earnings news to offset the negative sales data and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news already.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China.

(AAPL). However, the article mentions that Apple fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop since August, due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Given that the news does not provide any directly related information about Apple's future performance, we must consider the context of Apple's recent stock performance and market concerns. Apple's stock has been under pressure due to its own issues, and without any directly related negative news, the probability of a further fall might be relatively lower compared to a rise, which is speculative without a clear positive catalyst. Considering the overall market sentiment and the lack of direct correlation between Microsoft's AI investments and Apple's stock performance, I estimate the probabilities based on the existing market concerns and potential for rebound.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall due to this news. However, the market's reaction may be limited as it may have already factored in some of this decline. The overall sentiment from the previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models assigning a probability of stock price fall as high as 0.8. Given this information, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations.
