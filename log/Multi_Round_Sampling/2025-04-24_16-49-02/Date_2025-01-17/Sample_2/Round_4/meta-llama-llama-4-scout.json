(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Microsoft\u2019s Stock Revival Hinges on Showing Growth From AI Binge\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 6.1%, which exceeded analysts' expectations by 0.5%. Despite being labeled as the weakest performer among its peers, the stock has seen a modest increase of 1.7% since the earnings announcement. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, as indicated by the average 1.4% rise in stock prices of peers, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the market's cautious outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance of the stock price rising, the potential for a decline remains due to broader market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the ban itself doesn't directly harm Apple. In fact, it could be argued that it indirectly benefits Apple as it removes a competitor from the app store and potentially increases usage of other apps on iOS devices. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. The article mentions that Apple could face legal dilemmas if Trump delays enforcement of the law. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment. The article also mentions that Apple and Google could face penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news reports a significant drop in iPhone sales in China, a key market for Apple. This is negative news and would typically lead to a stock price decline. However, the headline also mentions a slight rebound in the stock price *after* the initial report. This suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports.  The mention of Trump tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty.  The rebound suggests the market's reaction is not solely driven by the China sales slump.  Given the mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, which could significantly impact the stock price regardless of the China sales figures, predicting a definitive price movement is difficult.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the negative sales data but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to other market factors and the potential for positive earnings news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's key assembly partner, Foxconn, is facing challenges in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China. This could potentially disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, leading to delays in product releases or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability. However, the extent of the impact depends on how quickly Foxconn can resolve these issues and whether Apple has alternative suppliers or contingency plans in place. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative impact on production, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news discusses Microsoft's AI investments and the potential impact on its stock price. However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The information about Microsoft's AI spending and its stock performance does not have a direct correlation with Apple's stock price movement. Apple's recent stock performance has been influenced by concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, as mentioned in the article. Given that the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, we should consider the probabilities of stock price movement based on the context provided. Apple's stock has already faced downward pressure due to its own issues, and without any directly related negative news, the probability of a further fall might be relatively lower compared to a rise, which is speculative without a clear positive catalyst.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news reports a decline in Apple's iPhone sales in China, with a 17% drop in annual shipments and a 25% drop in Q4 sales. This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. As a result, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in some of this decline, and the actual impact on the stock price may be limited.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations. Apple, as a primary distributor through its App Store, may face operational adjustments if TikTok is banned. However, the news also suggests that there are ongoing negotiations and possibilities for TikTok to remain operational, thereby reducing immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The broader implications and potential long-term effects need further analysis.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 6.1%, which exceeded analysts' expectations, indicating a solid performance despite being labeled the weakest among its peers. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, with an average rise of 1.4% in peer stock prices, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the cautious market outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the potential for a decline due to broader market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Supreme Court upholding a potential TikTok ban in the US, which has indirect implications for Apple. While Apple isn't directly targeted, the ban affects its App Store and could create legal dilemmas if enforcement is delayed. The article suggests that Apple could face penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the article also mentions that the ban could benefit Meta and YouTube, which are competitors to TikTok. The uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment towards Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture.  A decline in iPhone sales in China is undeniably negative, and several previous models correctly pointed out the potential for a stock price drop due to this. However, the headline also notes a slight rebound after the initial report. This suggests the market may have already partially priced in the bad news, or that other factors are at play.  The upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard; strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative China sales data.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  While the China sales slump is a concern, the rebound and upcoming earnings report make a definitive prediction difficult.  I'm leaning slightly towards a rise, acknowledging the risk of a fall, but giving more weight to the potential for positive earnings news to offset the negative sales data and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news already.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China.

This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall due to this news. However, the market's reaction may be limited as it may have already factored in some of this decline. The overall sentiment from the previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models assigning a probability of stock price fall as high as 0.8. Given this information, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news discusses potential regulatory changes and legal challenges surrounding TikTok, which could affect its operations.

Additionally, concerns over iPhone sales in China and the potential impact of regulatory changes related to TikTok create a mixed sentiment. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the potential for a decline due to broader market conditions and specific challenges Apple faces.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news focuses on the Supreme Court upholding a potential TikTok ban in the US, which has indirect implications for Apple. While Apple isn't directly targeted, the ban affects its App Store. The law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle host the app. Penalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user. Any executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect. Trump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take. This creates uncertainty and potential legal risks for Apple, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the impact is likely to be limited. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment towards Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future movement.  While the China sales slump is a concern, the rebound, the upcoming earnings report, and the fact that the stock has already experienced a significant drop, lead me to believe that the probability of a further significant drop is lower than a rise or sideways movement.  The probabilities are weighted to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the potential for positive earnings news and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China.

The reported slump in iPhone sales in China is a significant negative factor, and this is reflected in the initial market reaction and the consensus of previous model predictions leaning towards a price fall. However, the subsequent rebound in the stock price suggests that the market may have already partially priced in this negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors, such as the upcoming earnings report.  The earnings report is a crucial wildcard; strong earnings could easily offset the negative China sales data.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. While the China sales slump is a concern, the rebound, the upcoming earnings report, and the potential for other positive news (e.g., strong performance in other markets) make a definitive prediction difficult.  Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, acknowledging the risk of a fall, but giving more weight to the potential for positive earnings news and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news.  The consistent prediction of a price fall by several models, however, warrants caution and a probability that reflects the significant negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights challenges faced by Foxconn, Apple's key assembly partner, in deploying Chinese staff to India and importing machinery from China.
