This is generally considered neutral news.  While meeting expectations is positive in that it avoids a negative surprise, it doesn't provide a significant catalyst for a large price increase.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the positive aspect of meeting expectations, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal in the short term.  Other factors, such as overall market sentiment and broader economic conditions, will likely have a much larger impact on the stock price than this specific news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Poised for Largely In-Line First-Quarter Revenue, Morgan Stanley Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
