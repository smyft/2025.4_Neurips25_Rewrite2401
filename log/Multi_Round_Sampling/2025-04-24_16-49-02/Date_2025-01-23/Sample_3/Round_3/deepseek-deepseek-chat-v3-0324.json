(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing battle with Apple over app store fees and the introduction of third-party games to its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially increase competition and pressure on Apple's app store revenue, the current legal landscape shows that Apple has largely maintained its position, with a recent court ruling favoring them. Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's core business or financials. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates potential regulatory pressure from India on Apple and Google regarding their app store policies. This could lead to increased compliance costs, changes in business models, and potentially reduced revenue in a significant market like India. The inability to read the full article limits the depth of the analysis, but the headline suggests a negative impact. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations.  This is generally considered neutral news.  While meeting expectations is positive in that it avoids a negative surprise, it doesn't provide a significant catalyst for a large price increase.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the positive aspect of meeting expectations, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal in the short term.  Other factors, such as overall market sentiment and broader economic conditions, will likely have a much larger impact on the stock price than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust fines, which could signal a more favorable regulatory environment under his administration. However, the EU's aggressive stance and recent fines have already impacted Apple's earnings, as seen in the Q4 earnings per share drop. The market may react positively to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure in the future, but the immediate financial impact of the fines and ongoing legal battles could weigh on the stock. The balance between these factors suggests a slightly higher probability of a positive reaction due to political support outweighing the negative impact of fines.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store and potentially competing with Apple's App Store could be seen as a threat to Apple's business model. However, it's worth noting that this development is currently limited to the European Union and involves a relatively small number of games. Additionally, Epic Games' mobile store has only reached 29 million users by the end of 2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users. Given these factors, the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited. However, investors might be concerned about the potential erosion of Apple's App Store dominance and the possible implications for its revenue.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current stock price decline and analyst expectations for the company's future performance. Despite some analysts downgrading Apple's rating due to expected weak iPhone sales, Wedbush analysts maintain an 'Outperform' rating and $325 price target, citing the potential for Apple's AI strategy to drive growth. The article suggests that 2025 will be a 'fork in the road year' for Apple, with the company's AI strategy potentially transforming its consumer growth narrative. Given the mixed analyst opinions and the potential for Apple's AI strategy to drive growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite in its app store. Apple is reportedly reluctant to comply, similar to its stance in Russia in 2021. This situation may lead to potential legal challenges or policy changes that could affect Apple's operations in India. However, there is no immediate indication that this news alone would significantly impact the stock price positively or negatively. The market reaction would depend on how the situation unfolds and whether it leads to long-term consequences for Apple's business operations.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games ramping up its competition against Apple and Google by introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace suggests potential pressure on Apple's App Store revenue. While this could indicate a threat to Apple's business model, the current legal landscape shows that Apple has largely maintained its position, with recent court rulings favoring them. Additionally, the impact of this news appears to be limited to Europe and involves a small number of games. Given these factors, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement in either direction. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the competitive pressure, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates potential regulatory pressure from India on Apple regarding its app store policies. This could lead to increased compliance costs, changes in business models, and potentially reduced revenue in a significant market like India. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price decrease due to regulatory concerns and others suggesting a potential rise based on other factors. Given the specific news about India and the potential negative impact on Apple's app store revenue, I'm slightly increasing the probability of a stock price fall compared to the initial predictions, while still acknowledging the uncertainty due to the limited information available in the headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations. This is generally considered neutral news, as it avoids a negative surprise but doesn't provide a significant catalyst for a large price increase.  The lack of detail in the available news snippet prevents a deeper analysis.  However, considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions. Some models lean towards a slight increase due to meeting expectations, while others predict a slight decrease due to potential unseen negative factors hinted at in the premium content.  Given the neutral headline and the uncertainty introduced by the inaccessible premium content, I'm assigning probabilities closer to even odds, slightly favoring a neutral outcome (no significant change). The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock price movements based on limited information.  My prediction reflects a cautious approach, acknowledging the lack of strong directional signals from the available news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust fines, which could signal a more favorable regulatory environment under his administration. This political support may be viewed positively by investors, potentially offsetting some of the negative impact from the EU's aggressive stance and recent fines. However, the immediate financial impact of the fines, such as the Q4 earnings per share drop, and ongoing legal battles could weigh on the stock. Additionally, the broader context of antitrust scrutiny in both the EU and the US adds uncertainty. Balancing these factors, the potential for reduced regulatory pressure in the future may slightly outweigh the immediate negative financial impact, leading to a modestly higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store and potentially competing with Apple's App Store could be seen as a threat to Apple's business model, particularly in the European Union. However, the impact might be limited due to the relatively small number of games and users involved. Additionally, Epic Games' mobile store has only reached 29 million users by the end of 2024, which is below its target. The company's plan to offer free games and its program to cover core technology fees for developers might put some pressure on Apple's revenue but doesn't seem to pose an immediate significant threat. The introduction of third-party games on Epic's mobile store might increase competition but also presents an opportunity for Apple to adapt and potentially innovate in response. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise seems slightly higher than a fall, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current stock price decline and analyst expectations for the company's future performance.

Considering the mixed analyst opinions and the potential for Apple's AI strategy to drive growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The previous predictions from other models also show a trend of increasing optimism, with some models assigning a higher probability to the stock price rising. However, the current decline in stock price and concerns about iPhone sales should not be ignored, and therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is still significant.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential regulatory challenge for Apple in India related to hosting the GOV.in app suite. While the company is reportedly reluctant to comply, similar situations in Russia did not seem to cause significant stock price movements. The news does not suggest any immediate financial harm to Apple's core business, but the possibility of legal or policy challenges remains. Previous predictions vary widely, indicating mixed sentiments among analysts. Considering the mixed signals and lack of immediate financial impact, the stock price is likely to experience minor movements.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games ramping up competition against Apple by introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace suggests potential pressure on Apple's App Store revenue.

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price decrease due to regulatory concerns and others suggesting a potential rise based on other factors.

The trend of previous predictions seems to be stabilizing around a slightly negative outlook. Therefore, I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The headline indicates that Apple's Q1 revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations. This is generally considered neutral news, as it avoids a negative surprise but doesn't offer a strong catalyst for a significant price increase.  The lack of detail in the available news is a major limitation.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, with probabilities for a price rise ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 and probabilities for a price fall ranging from 0.35 to 0.6.  This divergence highlights the uncertainty surrounding the stock's movement based solely on this limited information.  The absence of specific details about the factors contributing to the 'largely in-line' revenue prediction prevents a more precise assessment.  Considering the neutral headline and the uncertainty reflected in previous predictions, I'm assigning probabilities close to even odds, slightly favoring a neutral outcome (no significant change).  Other market factors and broader economic conditions will likely have a much larger impact on the stock price than this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust fines, which could signal a more favorable regulatory environment under his administration.
