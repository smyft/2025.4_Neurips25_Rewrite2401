(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Epic Games' ongoing battle with Apple over app store fees and the introduction of third-party games to its mobile marketplace. While this could potentially increase competition and pressure on Apple's app store revenue, the current legal landscape shows that Apple has largely maintained its position, with a recent court ruling favoring them. Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's core business or financials. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook, with a slight inclination towards stability rather than significant movement in either direction.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates potential regulatory pressure from India on Apple and Google regarding their app store policies. This could lead to increased compliance costs, changes in business models, and potentially reduced revenue in a significant market like India. The inability to read the full article limits the depth of the analysis, but the headline suggests a negative impact. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's first-quarter revenue is expected to be in line with market expectations.  This is generally considered neutral news.  While meeting expectations is positive in that it avoids a negative surprise, it doesn't provide a significant catalyst for a large price increase.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the positive aspect of meeting expectations, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal in the short term.  Other factors, such as overall market sentiment and broader economic conditions, will likely have a much larger impact on the stock price than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights President Trump's defense of American tech giants, including Apple, against EU antitrust fines, which could signal a more favorable regulatory environment under his administration. However, the EU's aggressive stance and recent fines have already impacted Apple's earnings, as seen in the Q4 earnings per share drop. The market may react positively to the potential for reduced regulatory pressure in the future, but the immediate financial impact of the fines and ongoing legal battles could weigh on the stock. The balance between these factors suggests a slightly higher probability of a positive reaction due to political support outweighing the negative impact of fines.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store and potentially competing with Apple's App Store could be seen as a threat to Apple's business model. However, it's worth noting that this development is currently limited to the European Union and involves a relatively small number of games. Additionally, Epic Games' mobile store has only reached 29 million users by the end of 2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users. Given these factors, the impact on Apple's stock price may be limited. However, investors might be concerned about the potential erosion of Apple's App Store dominance and the possible implications for its revenue.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current stock price decline and analyst expectations for the company's future performance. Despite some analysts downgrading Apple's rating due to expected weak iPhone sales, Wedbush analysts maintain an 'Outperform' rating and $325 price target, citing the potential for Apple's AI strategy to drive growth. The article suggests that 2025 will be a 'fork in the road year' for Apple, with the company's AI strategy potentially transforming its consumer growth narrative. Given the mixed analyst opinions and the potential for Apple's AI strategy to drive growth, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing pressure from the Indian government to host the GOV.in app suite in its app store. Apple is reportedly reluctant to comply, similar to its stance in Russia in 2021. This situation may lead to potential legal challenges or policy changes that could affect Apple's operations in India. However, there is no immediate indication that this news alone would significantly impact the stock price positively or negatively. The market reaction would depend on how the situation unfolds and whether it leads to long-term consequences for Apple's business operations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
