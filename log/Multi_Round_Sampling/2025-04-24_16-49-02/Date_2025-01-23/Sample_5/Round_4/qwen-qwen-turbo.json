(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games launching a mobile store with third-party games could have mixed implications for Apple. On one hand, it highlights competition in the app marketplace, which could pressure Apple's App Store revenue model. On the other hand, Apple's existing user base and ecosystem remain strong, and the impact of Epic's new store may be limited in the short term. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate, while the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to potential concerns about competition and revenue impact.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline is very generic and clickbait-y. It doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's performance, new products, or any concrete reason why its stock price would significantly rise or fall. The phrase 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' is a common marketing tactic and lacks substance. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be negligible. A bull market generally suggests a positive trend, but this headline doesn't offer any Apple-specific catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI demand and superior margins compared to Apple.  Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US, impacting its growth prospects. While Apple maintains significant market share and profitability, Nvidia's current momentum and future outlook in the rapidly expanding AI sector suggest a higher probability of it surpassing Apple's market capitalization. However, the article's focus is on market cap comparison, not necessarily on individual stock price movements.  A rise in Nvidia's market cap doesn't automatically translate to a fall in Apple's stock price; both could theoretically rise or fall independently.  The probability of Apple's stock price falling is therefore lower than the probability of it remaining relatively stable or even slightly rising, given its established market position and brand strength.  The overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will also influence both stock prices.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's future stock performance. On one hand, analysts at Wedbush maintain a bullish stance, citing the potential of Apple's AI strategy and the upcoming iPhone 16 upgrade cycle as catalysts for growth. They also downplay concerns about China's market impact and maintain an 'Outperform' rating with a $325 price target. On the other hand, Jefferies has downgraded Apple due to expectations of weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales and cautious demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4. The stock has already seen an 8% decline this year, and Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the most valuable company. Given the conflicting analyst opinions and the current downward trend, the probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall, but the bullish long-term outlook from Wedbush provides some counterbalance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store and potentially competing with Apple's App Store could have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Epic Games' move to offer a mobile store with lower fees and more competitive offerings might reduce Apple's revenue from its App Store, which is a significant contributor to the company's overall income. Additionally, the fact that Epic Games will temporarily cover core technology fees for developers in Europe could further pressure Apple's business model. However, it's worth noting that Apple's App Store still maintains a significant advantage in terms of user base and brand loyalty. The impact on Apple's stock price might be limited as the company has a diversified business and a strong financial position. Nevertheless, the potential threat to its App Store dominance could lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple and other smartphone makers are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This could potentially lead to increased competition and reduced revenue for Apple, which might negatively impact its stock price. However, the actual impact depends on various factors, including the specifics of the Indian government's demands and Apple's response. Given the limited information available, I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute could potentially increase competition for Apple's App Store, which may impact its revenue negatively. However, Apple has shown resilience and has already seen partial success in court. The stock price movement could be influenced by investor sentiment towards Apple's ability to handle such challenges, but it is also important to consider other factors like overall market conditions, product releases, and broader economic trends.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games launching a mobile store with third-party games introduces increased competition for Apple's App Store, which could negatively impact Apple's revenue from app store fees. While Apple has a strong user base and brand loyalty, the potential for reduced revenue and the ongoing legal battles with Epic Games create uncertainty. Previous predictions show a trend of cautious sentiment towards Apple's stock, with many analysts highlighting the competitive pressures and mixed outlooks. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these competitive threats, while the probability of a rise is lower given the current market dynamics.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline is extremely generic and clickbait. It doesn't provide any specific information about Apple. The previous rounds of predictions also reflect this sentiment, with most models assigning a near-equal or slightly negative probability to the stock price rising. Given the lack of concrete information and the previous predictions, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable, but with a slight lean towards a potential rise due to the 'bull market' mention, even though it's vague.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's potential to surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company, primarily due to Nvidia's strong growth in the AI sector and Apple's facing headwinds in China and regulatory pressures.  While Nvidia's impressive growth is highlighted, the article doesn't directly predict a *fall* in Apple's stock price.  Apple's strong brand, existing market share, and profitability are acknowledged.  The comparison is about market capitalization, not necessarily individual stock price movements.  Therefore, a significant drop in Apple's stock price is less likely than a relatively stable or slightly negative movement. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a higher probability of a fall, but none strongly suggesting a significant drop. Considering the overall context, a slight decrease in Apple's stock price is more probable than a significant rise, given the competitive pressure from Nvidia and the challenges Apple faces. However, the probability of a fall is tempered by Apple's inherent strength and resilience.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's future stock performance.

Epic Games' move to offer a mobile store with lower fees and more competitive offerings might reduce Apple's revenue from its App Store, which is a significant contributor to the company's overall income. However, Apple's existing user base and ecosystem remain strong, and the impact of Epic's new store may be limited in the short term. Considering the mixed implications and the competitive landscape, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate, while the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to potential concerns about competition and revenue impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about India pressuring Apple and other smartphone makers to open up their app stores could have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. This is because increased competition and potential changes to Apple's revenue model from its App Store could lead to reduced profits. However, considering the company's strong brand, diversified business, and previous resilience to similar challenges, the impact might be limited. Given the mixed implications and the lack of specific details on how India's demands will be implemented, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling and a slightly lower probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees.

While Apple has shown resilience and partially succeeded in court, the ongoing competition and potential revenue impact could lead to decreased investor confidence. The previous predictions show a mix of sentiments with some considering the impact limited due to Apple's diversified business and strong financial position. Considering the mixed signals and the potential risk to App Store revenue, the likelihood of a stock price fall appears slightly higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games launching a mobile store with third-party games introduces increased competition for Apple's App Store, which could negatively impact Apple's revenue from app store fees.

While Nvidia's growth is impressive, the article doesn't directly predict a fall in Apple's stock price. Apple's strong brand, market share, and profitability are acknowledged. The comparison is about market capitalization, not necessarily individual stock price movements.  A direct correlation between Nvidia's rise and Apple's fall isn't guaranteed.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a higher probability of a fall for Apple, but none strongly suggesting a significant drop. Considering the overall context, a slight decrease in Apple's stock price is more probable than a significant rise, given the competitive pressure from Nvidia and the challenges Apple faces. However, the probability of a fall is tempered by Apple's inherent strength and resilience.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the consensus of previous predictions, leaning slightly towards a fall, but acknowledging Apple's inherent strength.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

The article also points out Apple's higher sales and gross profit compared to Nvidia, despite Nvidia's higher gross margin.  Apple's challenges are real, but its overall financial strength and established market position suggest a less dramatic price movement than might be implied by the headline. Considering the overall context and the previous predictions, a slight decrease in Apple's stock price is more probable than a significant rise, given the competitive pressure from Nvidia and the challenges Apple faces. However, the probability of a fall is tempered by Apple's inherent strength and resilience.  The probability of a rise is also influenced by the possibility that the market may not fully react to the Nvidia comparison, especially given Apple's continued strong performance in other areas.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
