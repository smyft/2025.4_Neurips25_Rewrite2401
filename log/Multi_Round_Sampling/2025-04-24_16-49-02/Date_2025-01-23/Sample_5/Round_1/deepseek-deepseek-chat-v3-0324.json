(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple faces a 'fork in the road year,' analysts say\nNews Content: Photo: Cheng Xin (Getty Images)\n\nAs Apple (AAPL) stock takes a tumble to kick off 2025, analysts at Wedbush don\u2019t see cause for concern.\n\n\u201cWe believe the panic and bear frenzy around Apple is way overdone\u201d heading into next week\u2019s December earnings report, analysts led by Dan Ives said in a research note Wednesday.\n\nSo far this year, shares of the Cupertino, California-based company are down more than 8% as expectations around sales for the 2025 fiscal year fall short. Last week, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance.\n\nShares of Apple were up 0.25% Wednesday morning, after closing at $223.83 Tuesday.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies also said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March.\n\nThis slide in stock price caused chipmaker Nvidia to overtake Apple as the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.\n\nBut analysts at Wedbush said that overall unit declines in China are \u201cmanageable,\u201d and that investors will get a better understanding of Apple\u2019s China turnaround once it announces its regional AI partner, which will likely be Baidu (BIDU). Tencent (TCEHY) and ByteDance are also in the running, Ives said.\n\nAs a result, the securities firm maintained its \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and $325 price target\n\n\u201cWith Apple Intelligence being rolled out in a phased strategy the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle is the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world\u2019s population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nAlthough Jefferies and others have raised concerns about Apple\u2019s AI strategy, which came late in the game compared with competitors and is being rolled out in phases through the tech giant\u2019s latest models, Ives believes 2025 will be a \u201cfork in the road year\u201d for Apple.\n\n\u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither will Apple\u2019s AI strategy,\u201d Ives said. \u201cbut the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.\u201d\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games launching a mobile store with third-party games could have mixed implications for Apple. On one hand, it highlights competition in the app marketplace, which could pressure Apple's App Store revenue model. On the other hand, Apple's existing user base and ecosystem remain strong, and the impact of Epic's new store may be limited in the short term. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate, while the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to potential concerns about competition and revenue impact.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline is very generic and clickbait-y. It doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's performance, new products, or any concrete reason why its stock price would significantly rise or fall. The phrase 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' is a common marketing tactic and lacks substance. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be negligible. A bull market generally suggests a positive trend, but this headline doesn't offer any Apple-specific catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI demand and superior margins compared to Apple.  Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US, impacting its growth prospects. While Apple maintains significant market share and profitability, Nvidia's current momentum and future outlook in the rapidly expanding AI sector suggest a higher probability of it surpassing Apple's market capitalization. However, the article's focus is on market cap comparison, not necessarily on individual stock price movements.  A rise in Nvidia's market cap doesn't automatically translate to a fall in Apple's stock price; both could theoretically rise or fall independently.  The probability of Apple's stock price falling is therefore lower than the probability of it remaining relatively stable or even slightly rising, given its established market position and brand strength.  The overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will also influence both stock prices.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's future stock performance. On one hand, analysts at Wedbush maintain a bullish stance, citing the potential of Apple's AI strategy and the upcoming iPhone 16 upgrade cycle as catalysts for growth. They also downplay concerns about China's market impact and maintain an 'Outperform' rating with a $325 price target. On the other hand, Jefferies has downgraded Apple due to expectations of weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales and cautious demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4. The stock has already seen an 8% decline this year, and Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the most valuable company. Given the conflicting analyst opinions and the current downward trend, the probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall, but the bullish long-term outlook from Wedbush provides some counterbalance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store and potentially competing with Apple's App Store could have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Epic Games' move to offer a mobile store with lower fees and more competitive offerings might reduce Apple's revenue from its App Store, which is a significant contributor to the company's overall income. Additionally, the fact that Epic Games will temporarily cover core technology fees for developers in Europe could further pressure Apple's business model. However, it's worth noting that Apple's App Store still maintains a significant advantage in terms of user base and brand loyalty. The impact on Apple's stock price might be limited as the company has a diversified business and a strong financial position. Nevertheless, the potential threat to its App Store dominance could lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple and other smartphone makers are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This could potentially lead to increased competition and reduced revenue for Apple, which might negatively impact its stock price. However, the actual impact depends on various factors, including the specifics of the Indian government's demands and Apple's response. Given the limited information available, I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute could potentially increase competition for Apple's App Store, which may impact its revenue negatively. However, Apple has shown resilience and has already seen partial success in court. The stock price movement could be influenced by investor sentiment towards Apple's ability to handle such challenges, but it is also important to consider other factors like overall market conditions, product releases, and broader economic trends.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
