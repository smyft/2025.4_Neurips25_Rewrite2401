(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games launching a mobile store with third-party games could have mixed implications for Apple. On one hand, it highlights competition in the app marketplace, which could pressure Apple's App Store revenue model. On the other hand, Apple's existing user base and ecosystem remain strong, and the impact of Epic's new store may be limited in the short term. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate, while the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to potential concerns about competition and revenue impact.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline is very generic and clickbait-y. It doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's performance, new products, or any concrete reason why its stock price would significantly rise or fall. The phrase 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' is a common marketing tactic and lacks substance. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be negligible. A bull market generally suggests a positive trend, but this headline doesn't offer any Apple-specific catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The article highlights Nvidia's strong growth driven by AI demand and superior margins compared to Apple.  Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US, impacting its growth prospects. While Apple maintains significant market share and profitability, Nvidia's current momentum and future outlook in the rapidly expanding AI sector suggest a higher probability of it surpassing Apple's market capitalization. However, the article's focus is on market cap comparison, not necessarily on individual stock price movements.  A rise in Nvidia's market cap doesn't automatically translate to a fall in Apple's stock price; both could theoretically rise or fall independently.  The probability of Apple's stock price falling is therefore lower than the probability of it remaining relatively stable or even slightly rising, given its established market position and brand strength.  The overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will also influence both stock prices.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed view of Apple's future stock performance. On one hand, analysts at Wedbush maintain a bullish stance, citing the potential of Apple's AI strategy and the upcoming iPhone 16 upgrade cycle as catalysts for growth. They also downplay concerns about China's market impact and maintain an 'Outperform' rating with a $325 price target. On the other hand, Jefferies has downgraded Apple due to expectations of weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales and cautious demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4. The stock has already seen an 8% decline this year, and Nvidia has overtaken Apple as the most valuable company. Given the conflicting analyst opinions and the current downward trend, the probability of a rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall, but the bullish long-term outlook from Wedbush provides some counterbalance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games adding third-party games to its mobile store and potentially competing with Apple's App Store could have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Epic Games' move to offer a mobile store with lower fees and more competitive offerings might reduce Apple's revenue from its App Store, which is a significant contributor to the company's overall income. Additionally, the fact that Epic Games will temporarily cover core technology fees for developers in Europe could further pressure Apple's business model. However, it's worth noting that Apple's App Store still maintains a significant advantage in terms of user base and brand loyalty. The impact on Apple's stock price might be limited as the company has a diversified business and a strong financial position. Nevertheless, the potential threat to its App Store dominance could lead to a slight decrease in investor confidence.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple and other smartphone makers are facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This could potentially lead to increased competition and reduced revenue for Apple, which might negatively impact its stock price. However, the actual impact depends on various factors, including the specifics of the Indian government's demands and Apple's response. Given the limited information available, I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute could potentially increase competition for Apple's App Store, which may impact its revenue negatively. However, Apple has shown resilience and has already seen partial success in court. The stock price movement could be influenced by investor sentiment towards Apple's ability to handle such challenges, but it is also important to consider other factors like overall market conditions, product releases, and broader economic trends.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
