(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Oracle Takes Run at Cloud\u2019s Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. If consumers prefer Epic's platform, it could lead to reduced revenue for Apple from its App Store. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a potential for a negative impact, it may not be significant enough to cause a drastic drop in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Perplexity's entry might pose a minor threat to Apple's Siri, Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. This suggests a general trend of innovation and competition in the AI assistant space, which is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant. The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple's market position. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low. The probability of a rise is also not significantly impacted as the news doesn't present a clear positive catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting perspectives on Apple's future.  Jefferies downgrades Apple due to weak iPhone sales expectations and concerns about the AI strategy rollout.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, highlighting manageable China unit declines, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The disagreement between these reputable firms suggests significant uncertainty. While the short-term outlook appears bearish due to immediate sales concerns, the long-term potential of AI integration and the Wedbush's bullish price target of $325 (significantly higher than the current price) suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long term.  The current market reaction is mixed, with a slight upward movement after a recent drop.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish sentiment, but acknowledge the significant short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price. Positive aspects include Apple's CEO Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump, which may help avoid tariffs and reduce antitrust regulations, potentially benefiting Apple's bottom line. Additionally, the focus on AI and potential relaxed regulations could spur growth. However, uncertainties around the CHIPS Act and broader market reactions to Big Tech earnings could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong position and historical resilience, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Mark Zuckerberg may have doubts about Apple's innovation, but the article argues that this shouldn't matter to investors. This implies that the news may not have a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price. In fact, the article's tone seems to downplay the concerns about Apple's innovation, which could lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction from investors. As a result, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases against these companies in the US, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering Trump's support and the potential for a more forgiving regulatory environment, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's ambitious plans involving a significant joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud business with the backing of SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI. While this news is positive and indicates potential growth for Oracle, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the news may indirectly influence investor sentiment towards cloud computing stocks. Apple Inc. has faced recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, leading to a decline in stock price. The indirect impact of Oracle's news on Apple's stock price is likely minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector, which could lead to reduced revenue from the App Store. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings may mitigate the potential negative impact. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some indicating a bearish outlook due to competition and others highlighting Apple's resilience and long-term growth potential. Given the mixed signals and the competitive landscape, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to immediate concerns, but not significantly so due to Apple's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. Perplexity's entry, while backed by significant players like Nvidia and Jeff Bezos, is unlikely to pose a significant threat to Apple's Siri in the short term. Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. The article mentions Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant.

Jefferies' downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales and concerns about the AI strategy, suggests a bearish short-term outlook.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, emphasizing manageable China issues, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The $325 price target from Wedbush is significantly higher than the current price, indicating substantial upside potential.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning bullish and others bearish.  Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the uncertainty surrounding the success of Apple's AI strategy and the iPhone sales, a neutral stance is warranted.  The short-term outlook is clouded by weak sales, but the long-term potential is significant.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a rise, reflecting the long-term bullish potential, but acknowledging the short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price.

In fact, the article's tone seems to downplay the concerns about Apple's innovation, which could lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction from investors. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment but with a slight inclination towards a positive outlook. Several models have predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, citing factors such as Apple's strong position, potential AI integration benefits, and a favorable regulatory environment. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases against these companies in the US, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering Trump's support and the potential for a more forgiving regulatory environment, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. Additionally, the fact that Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, are seeking to cozy up to Trump and have donated to his inauguration campaign, suggests a potential for a more favorable business environment for these companies. This, combined with the overall trend of others' predictions, which indicate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, leads to the conclusion that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Oracle and its joint venture in the cloud computing space, backed by SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI. While Oracle's aggressive move into cloud computing could create competitive dynamics in the market, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple has been facing recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, which led to a decline in stock price. The provided news does not provide any direct information that would significantly change the market perception of Apple. Investors' focus on recent weak sales and the absence of direct positive news for Apple suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
