      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors\nNews Content: Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025.

The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. If consumers prefer Epic's platform, it could lead to reduced revenue for Apple from its App Store. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a potential for a negative impact, it may not be significant enough to cause a drastic drop in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Perplexity's entry might pose a minor threat to Apple's Siri, Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. This suggests a general trend of innovation and competition in the AI assistant space, which is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant. The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple's market position. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low. The probability of a rise is also not significantly impacted as the news doesn't present a clear positive catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting perspectives on Apple's future.  Jefferies downgrades Apple due to weak iPhone sales expectations and concerns about the AI strategy rollout.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, highlighting manageable China unit declines, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The disagreement between these reputable firms suggests significant uncertainty. While the short-term outlook appears bearish due to immediate sales concerns, the long-term potential of AI integration and the Wedbush's bullish price target of $325 (significantly higher than the current price) suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long term.  The current market reaction is mixed, with a slight upward movement after a recent drop.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish sentiment, but acknowledge the significant short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price. Positive aspects include Apple's CEO Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump, which may help avoid tariffs and reduce antitrust regulations, potentially benefiting Apple's bottom line. Additionally, the focus on AI and potential relaxed regulations could spur growth. However, uncertainties around the CHIPS Act and broader market reactions to Big Tech earnings could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong position and historical resilience, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Mark Zuckerberg may have doubts about Apple's innovation, but the article argues that this shouldn't matter to investors. This implies that the news may not have a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price. In fact, the article's tone seems to downplay the concerns about Apple's innovation, which could lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction from investors. As a result, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases against these companies in the US, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering Trump's support and the potential for a more forgiving regulatory environment, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's ambitious plans involving a significant joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud business with the backing of SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI. While this news is positive and indicates potential growth for Oracle, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the news may indirectly influence investor sentiment towards cloud computing stocks. Apple Inc. has faced recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, leading to a decline in stock price. The indirect impact of Oracle's news on Apple's stock price is likely minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector, which could lead to reduced revenue from the App Store. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings may mitigate the potential negative impact. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some indicating a bearish outlook due to competition and others highlighting Apple's resilience and long-term growth potential. Given the mixed signals and the competitive landscape, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to immediate concerns, but not significantly so due to Apple's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. Perplexity's entry, while backed by significant players like Nvidia and Jeff Bezos, is unlikely to pose a significant threat to Apple's Siri in the short term. Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. The article mentions Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant. The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple's market position. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is no strong signal indicating a significant price movement. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low. The probability of a rise is also not significantly impacted as the news doesn't present a clear positive catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Jefferies' downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales and concerns about the AI strategy, suggests a bearish short-term outlook.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, emphasizing manageable China issues, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The $325 price target from Wedbush is significantly higher than the current price, indicating substantial upside potential.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning bullish and others bearish.  Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the uncertainty surrounding the success of Apple's AI strategy and the iPhone sales, a neutral stance is warranted.  The short-term outlook is clouded by weak sales, but the long-term potential is significant.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a rise, reflecting the long-term bullish potential, but acknowledging the short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price.

In fact, the article's tone seems to downplay the concerns about Apple's innovation, which could lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction from investors. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment but with a slight inclination towards a positive outlook. Several models have predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, citing factors such as Apple's strong position, potential AI integration benefits, and a favorable regulatory environment. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases against these companies in the US, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering Trump's support and the potential for a more forgiving regulatory environment, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. Additionally, the fact that Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, are seeking to cozy up to Trump and have donated to his inauguration campaign, suggests a potential for a more favorable business environment for these companies. This, combined with the overall trend of others' predictions, which indicate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, leads to the conclusion that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Oracle and its joint venture in the cloud computing space, backed by SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI. While Oracle's aggressive move into cloud computing could create competitive dynamics in the market, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple has been facing recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, which led to a decline in stock price. The provided news does not provide any direct information that would significantly change the market perception of Apple. Investors' focus on recent weak sales and the absence of direct positive news for Apple suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector, which could lead to reduced revenue from the App Store.

While this introduces more competition, Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI for ChatGPT. The news suggests a general trend of innovation in the AI assistant space. Considering Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships, the impact of Perplexity's assistant might be limited. The previous rounds of predictions show mixed sentiments, with some leaning towards a slight negative impact due to competition, while others highlight Apple's resilience.

Jefferies' downgrade highlights concerns about weak iPhone sales and a late-to-market AI strategy.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, citing manageable China issues, potential for a significant AI partnership (potentially with Baidu), and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The $325 price target from Wedbush is significantly higher than the current price, suggesting substantial upside potential.  The previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities of a price rise ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 and probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.2 to 0.7.  This divergence reflects the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance and the long-term impact of its AI strategy.  While the short-term outlook is clouded by weak iPhone sales, the potential for a successful AI partnership and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long run.  Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish potential, but acknowledging the significant short-term risks. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, which I am also incorporating into my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings season, with a focus on how President Trump's policies might impact companies like Apple.

Given Apple's strong position and historical resilience, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. Previous predictions also show a mixed sentiment but with a slight inclination towards a positive outlook, supporting this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Mark Zuckerberg's doubts about Apple's innovation but argues that this shouldn't impact investors significantly. Several previous predictions indicate a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models leaning bullish due to long-term growth potential and others bearish due to immediate sales concerns and competition. The overall sentiment seems to suggest that while there are concerns about Apple's innovation and iPhone sales, there is also a significant amount of resilience and potential for growth, especially considering the company's strong position and historical performance. Given the information and previous predictions, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, reflecting both the short-term challenges and the long-term potential of Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles, which could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration.
