(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. If consumers prefer Epic's platform, it could lead to reduced revenue for Apple from its App Store. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a potential for a negative impact, it may not be significant enough to cause a drastic drop in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Perplexity's entry might pose a minor threat to Apple's Siri, Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. This suggests a general trend of innovation and competition in the AI assistant space, which is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant. The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple's market position. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low. The probability of a rise is also not significantly impacted as the news doesn't present a clear positive catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting perspectives on Apple's future.  Jefferies downgrades Apple due to weak iPhone sales expectations and concerns about the AI strategy rollout.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, highlighting manageable China unit declines, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The disagreement between these reputable firms suggests significant uncertainty. While the short-term outlook appears bearish due to immediate sales concerns, the long-term potential of AI integration and the Wedbush's bullish price target of $325 (significantly higher than the current price) suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long term.  The current market reaction is mixed, with a slight upward movement after a recent drop.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish sentiment, but acknowledge the significant short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price. Positive aspects include Apple's CEO Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump, which may help avoid tariffs and reduce antitrust regulations, potentially benefiting Apple's bottom line. Additionally, the focus on AI and potential relaxed regulations could spur growth. However, uncertainties around the CHIPS Act and broader market reactions to Big Tech earnings could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong position and historical resilience, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Mark Zuckerberg may have doubts about Apple's innovation, but the article argues that this shouldn't matter to investors. This implies that the news may not have a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price. In fact, the article's tone seems to downplay the concerns about Apple's innovation, which could lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction from investors. As a result, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases against these companies in the US, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering Trump's support and the potential for a more forgiving regulatory environment, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's ambitious plans involving a significant joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud business with the backing of SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI. While this news is positive and indicates potential growth for Oracle, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the news may indirectly influence investor sentiment towards cloud computing stocks. Apple Inc. has faced recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, leading to a decline in stock price. The indirect impact of Oracle's news on Apple's stock price is likely minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector, which could lead to reduced revenue from the App Store. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings may mitigate the potential negative impact. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some indicating a bearish outlook due to competition and others highlighting Apple's resilience and long-term growth potential. Given the mixed signals and the competitive landscape, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to immediate concerns, but not significantly so due to Apple's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. Perplexity's entry, while backed by significant players like Nvidia and Jeff Bezos, is unlikely to pose a significant threat to Apple's Siri in the short term. Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. The article mentions Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant. The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple's market position.

However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, emphasizing manageable China issues, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The $325 price target from Wedbush is significantly higher than the current price, indicating substantial upside potential.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning bullish and others bearish.  Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the uncertainty surrounding the success of Apple's AI strategy and the iPhone sales, a neutral stance is warranted.  The short-term outlook is clouded by weak sales, but the long-term potential is significant.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a rise, reflecting the long-term bullish potential, but acknowledging the short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment but with a slight inclination towards a positive outlook. Several models have predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, citing factors such as Apple's strong position, potential AI integration benefits, and a favorable regulatory environment. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles.

While Oracle's aggressive move into cloud computing could create competitive dynamics in the market, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple has been facing recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, which led to a decline in stock price. The provided news does not provide any direct information that would significantly change the market perception of Apple. Investors' focus on recent weak sales and the absence of direct positive news for Apple suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector, which could lead to reduced revenue from the App Store.

While this introduces more competition, Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI for ChatGPT. The news suggests a general trend of innovation in the AI assistant space. Considering Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships, the impact of Perplexity's assistant might be limited. The previous rounds of predictions show mixed sentiments, with some leaning towards a slight negative impact due to competition, while others highlight Apple's resilience.

Jefferies' downgrade highlights concerns about weak iPhone sales and a late-to-market AI strategy.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, citing manageable China issues, potential for a significant AI partnership (potentially with Baidu), and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The $325 price target from Wedbush is significantly higher than the current price, suggesting substantial upside potential.  The previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities of a price rise ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 and probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.2 to 0.7.  This divergence reflects the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance and the long-term impact of its AI strategy.  While the short-term outlook is clouded by weak iPhone sales, the potential for a successful AI partnership and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long run.  Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish potential, but acknowledging the significant short-term risks. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, which I am also incorporating into my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings season, with a focus on how President Trump's policies might impact companies like Apple.

Several previous predictions indicate a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models leaning bullish due to long-term growth potential and others bearish due to immediate sales concerns and competition. The overall sentiment seems to suggest that while there are concerns about Apple's innovation and iPhone sales, there is also a significant amount of resilience and potential for growth, especially considering the company's strong position and historical performance.
