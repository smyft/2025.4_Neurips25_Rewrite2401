      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Takes on Google, Apple With Third-Party Games on Company's Own App Marketplace\nNews Content: Epic Games is planning to introduce 19 third-party games to its mobile marketplace on Alphabet's (GO\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription? Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. If consumers prefer Epic's platform, it could lead to reduced revenue for Apple from its App Store. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a potential for a negative impact, it may not be significant enough to cause a drastic drop in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. While Perplexity's entry might pose a minor threat to Apple's Siri, Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. This suggests a general trend of innovation and competition in the AI assistant space, which is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant. The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple's market position. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low. The probability of a rise is also not significantly impacted as the news doesn't present a clear positive catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting perspectives on Apple's future.  Jefferies downgrades Apple due to weak iPhone sales expectations and concerns about the AI strategy rollout.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, highlighting manageable China unit declines, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The disagreement between these reputable firms suggests significant uncertainty. While the short-term outlook appears bearish due to immediate sales concerns, the long-term potential of AI integration and the Wedbush's bullish price target of $325 (significantly higher than the current price) suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long term.  The current market reaction is mixed, with a slight upward movement after a recent drop.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish sentiment, but acknowledge the significant short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price. Positive aspects include Apple's CEO Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump, which may help avoid tariffs and reduce antitrust regulations, potentially benefiting Apple's bottom line. Additionally, the focus on AI and potential relaxed regulations could spur growth. However, uncertainties around the CHIPS Act and broader market reactions to Big Tech earnings could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong position and historical resilience, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Mark Zuckerberg may have doubts about Apple's innovation, but the article argues that this shouldn't matter to investors. This implies that the news may not have a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price. In fact, the article's tone seems to downplay the concerns about Apple's innovation, which could lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction from investors. As a result, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases against these companies in the US, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering Trump's support and the potential for a more forgiving regulatory environment, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses Oracle's ambitious plans involving a significant joint venture aimed at expanding its cloud business with the backing of SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI. While this news is positive and indicates potential growth for Oracle, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the news may indirectly influence investor sentiment towards cloud computing stocks. Apple Inc. has faced recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, leading to a decline in stock price. The indirect impact of Oracle's news on Apple's stock price is likely minimal.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector, which could lead to reduced revenue from the App Store. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings may mitigate the potential negative impact. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some indicating a bearish outlook due to competition and others highlighting Apple's resilience and long-term growth potential. Given the mixed signals and the competitive landscape, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to immediate concerns, but not significantly so due to Apple's overall strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market. Perplexity's entry, while backed by significant players like Nvidia and Jeff Bezos, is unlikely to pose a significant threat to Apple's Siri in the short term. Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI to incorporate ChatGPT. Furthermore, Amazon is also developing a refreshed Alexa. The article mentions Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships mitigate the potential negative impact of Perplexity's new assistant. The news is more of a general industry trend than a specific threat to Apple's market position. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is no strong signal indicating a significant price movement. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low. The probability of a rise is also not significantly impacted as the news doesn't present a clear positive catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Jefferies' downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales and concerns about the AI strategy, suggests a bearish short-term outlook.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, emphasizing manageable China issues, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The $325 price target from Wedbush is significantly higher than the current price, indicating substantial upside potential.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning bullish and others bearish.  Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the uncertainty surrounding the success of Apple's AI strategy and the iPhone sales, a neutral stance is warranted.  The short-term outlook is clouded by weak sales, but the long-term potential is significant.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a rise, reflecting the long-term bullish potential, but acknowledging the short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights several factors that could influence Apple's stock price.

This implies that the news may not have a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price. In fact, the article's tone seems to downplay the concerns about Apple's innovation, which could lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction from investors. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed sentiment but with a slight inclination towards a positive outlook. Several models have predicted a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, citing factors such as Apple's strong position, potential AI integration benefits, and a favorable regulatory environment. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles. This could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust cases against these companies in the US, which could negatively impact their stock prices. Considering Trump's support and the potential for a more forgiving regulatory environment, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. Additionally, the fact that Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, are seeking to cozy up to Trump and have donated to his inauguration campaign, suggests a potential for a more favorable business environment for these companies. This, combined with the overall trend of others' predictions, which indicate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, leads to the conclusion that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on Oracle and its joint venture in the cloud computing space, backed by SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI. While Oracle's aggressive move into cloud computing could create competitive dynamics in the market, it does not directly affect Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple has been facing recent challenges with weak iPhone sales, which led to a decline in stock price. The provided news does not provide any direct information that would significantly change the market perception of Apple. Investors' focus on recent weak sales and the absence of direct positive news for Apple suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector, which could lead to reduced revenue from the App Store. This concern is reflected in the previous predictions, which show a range of sentiments, with some indicating a bearish outlook due to competition and others highlighting Apple's resilience and long-term growth potential. Given the mixed signals and the competitive landscape, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to immediate concerns, but not significantly so due to Apple's overall strength and brand loyalty.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Perplexity launching an AI assistant on Android is a competitive move against established players like Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa. While this introduces more competition, Apple has already integrated Apple Intelligence and partnered with OpenAI for ChatGPT. The news suggests a general trend of innovation in the AI assistant space. Considering Apple's existing AI capabilities and partnerships, the impact of Perplexity's assistant might be limited. The previous rounds of predictions show mixed sentiments, with some leaning towards a slight negative impact due to competition, while others highlight Apple's resilience. Given the existing AI integrations and the overall competitive landscape, the probability of a significant stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not drastically so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Jefferies' downgrade highlights concerns about weak iPhone sales and a late-to-market AI strategy.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, citing manageable China issues, potential for a significant AI partnership (potentially with Baidu), and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The $325 price target from Wedbush is significantly higher than the current price, suggesting substantial upside potential.  The previous predictions are mixed, with probabilities of a price rise ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 and probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.2 to 0.7.  This divergence reflects the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance and the long-term impact of its AI strategy.  While the short-term outlook is clouded by weak iPhone sales, the potential for a successful AI partnership and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long run.  Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish potential, but acknowledging the significant short-term risks. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, which I am also incorporating into my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news discusses the upcoming Big Tech earnings season, with a focus on how President Trump's policies might impact companies like Apple. Positive factors include Apple CEO Tim Cook's good relationship with Trump, which could help avoid tariffs and reduce antitrust regulations, potentially benefiting Apple's bottom line. Additionally, the focus on AI and potential relaxed regulations could spur growth. However, uncertainties around the CHIPS Act and broader market reactions to Big Tech earnings could introduce volatility. Given Apple's strong position and historical resilience, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. Previous predictions also show a mixed sentiment but with a slight inclination towards a positive outlook, supporting this view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Mark Zuckerberg's doubts about Apple's innovation but argues that this shouldn't impact investors significantly. Several previous predictions indicate a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price, with some models leaning bullish due to long-term growth potential and others bearish due to immediate sales concerns and competition. The overall sentiment seems to suggest that while there are concerns about Apple's innovation and iPhone sales, there is also a significant amount of resilience and potential for growth, especially considering the company's strong position and historical performance. Given the information and previous predictions, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, reflecting both the short-term challenges and the long-term potential of Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's defense of American tech companies, including Apple, against EU antitrust battles, which could indicate a more favorable regulatory environment for these companies under Trump's administration.
