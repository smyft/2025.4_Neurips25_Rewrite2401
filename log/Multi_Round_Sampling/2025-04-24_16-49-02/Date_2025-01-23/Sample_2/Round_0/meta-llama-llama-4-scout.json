This implies that the news may not have a significant negative impact on Apple's stock price. In fact, the article's tone seems to downplay the concerns about Apple's innovation, which could lead to a neutral or slightly positive reaction from investors. As a result, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Mark Zuckerberg May Be Right About Apple's Lack of Innovation.
