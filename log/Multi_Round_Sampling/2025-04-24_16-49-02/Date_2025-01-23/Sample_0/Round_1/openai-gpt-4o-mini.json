This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news from Greenlight Capital indicates a cautious outlook on the overall market, with concerns about high valuations and disappointing data regarding Apple. Despite Apple being a popular stock among hedge funds, the sentiment expressed suggests that investors may be shifting focus towards AI stocks, which could detract from Apple's appeal. The recent negative return of -13.59% over the past month further supports the likelihood of continued downward pressure on the stock. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems. Regulatory scrutiny often creates uncertainty and can lead to potential fines or changes in business practices, which investors typically view negatively. While the full impact is unknown without access to the full article, the initial headline suggests a potential negative impact. The lack of details in the provided excerpt makes a precise probability assessment difficult, but the presence of a regulatory probe generally leans towards a negative outlook in the short term. The fact that the article is behind a paywall suggests it contains potentially market-moving information.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline presents a contrasting viewpoint: Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's innovation versus the article's argument that this shouldn't affect investors.  The article likely provides counterarguments, such as Apple's strong brand loyalty, robust ecosystem, consistent profitability, and potential future innovations that outweigh the perceived lack of recent groundbreaking products.  While Zuckerberg's opinion carries weight, it's unlikely to significantly sway the market on its own.  The market generally reacts to more concrete factors like financial performance, product announcements, and overall economic conditions.  Therefore, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly positive impact, as the article itself downplays the negative implications of Zuckerberg's statement.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher due to the article's counter-narrative.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Oracle Corp.'s advancements in cloud computing and AI, backed by a significant joint venture and political support from President Trump. While this could positively impact Oracle's stock, the analysis for Apple Inc. (AAPL) is derived from a brief mention in the 'Tech Chart of the Day' section, which highlights Apple's recent slump due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. The negative sentiment around iPhone sales and the stock's recent decline suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Epic Games' efforts to challenge Apple's and Google's dominance in the mobile app store market by adding third-party game titles to its Epic Games Store. While Epic Games has made some progress, it still faces significant hurdles, including Apple's Core Technology Fee and other restrictions. The dispute has been ongoing since 2020, and a recent court ruling mostly favored Apple. The news is likely to be perceived as a negative for Apple, as it highlights the ongoing challenges to its app store business model. However, given that the dispute is not new and Apple's stock has already priced in some of these risks, the immediate impact on the stock price may be limited. Nevertheless, the persistent challenge to Apple's app store dominance could weigh on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's current stock price decline and analyst expectations for the company's future performance. Despite concerns about iPhone sales and Apple's AI strategy, Wedbush analysts maintain an 'Outperform' rating and $325 price target, citing the potential for Apple's AI strategy to drive growth in the coming years. The article also mentions that the decline in stock price is seen as overdone by Wedbush analysts, which suggests a potential rebound. However, Jefferies analysts have downgraded Apple's rating, citing expectations of weak iPhone sales and limited hardware upgrades. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, as the overall tone of the article suggests that the decline may be temporary and that Apple's long-term prospects remain strong.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's fiscal first-quarter revenue is expected to be largely in line with market estimates. This suggests no significant positive or negative surprise, which typically results in modest movements in stock prices. Since the news does not present any unexpected developments or strong catalysts for significant change, the probabilities for either rise or fall are relatively balanced but slightly favor a minor increase due to confirmation of expectations.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
