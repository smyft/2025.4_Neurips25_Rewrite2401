A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which remains a core holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The focus on AI and Apple's recent advancements in integrating AI into its products suggests a positive outlook for the company. Given Buffett's historical success in stock selection and the growing importance of AI in technology, there is a strong likelihood that investor sentiment will be favorable, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the recent selling of a portion of Apple's shares by Berkshire may introduce some uncertainty, but overall, the positive developments in AI integration outweigh this concern.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's current market capitalization lead, it highlights several headwinds: slowing growth in the saturated smartphone market, regulatory pressures in the US, and challenges in China due to the lack of a local partner for Apple Intelligence. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth driven by strong demand for AI GPUs and boasts significantly higher gross profit margins. The article suggests Nvidia's outlook for 2025 is stronger. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's stock advisor team doesn't consider Nvidia as one of the best stocks to buy now. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings expectations, citing weakening China orders and the underperformance of AI initiatives.  While Cramer acknowledges Apple's AI innovation, his strong negative sentiment regarding the upcoming earnings and guidance significantly outweighs any positive aspects.  The article also highlights the widespread negative sentiment surrounding Apple's performance, suggesting a consensus view of an earnings miss.  This negative outlook from a prominent financial commentator, coupled with the general expectation of poor performance, increases the likelihood of a stock price decline.  However, it's important to note that Cramer's predictions are not always accurate, and other factors could influence the stock price.  Therefore, while the probability of a price fall is higher, a price rise is still possible due to unforeseen positive developments or market-wide trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic and suggests a bullish sentiment towards the stock, which could attract investor interest. However, the content does not provide specific fundamental or technical details about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. The headline's tone may influence short-term sentiment, but without concrete data or catalysts, the impact is likely limited. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain moderate due to the lack of substantive information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased regulatory pressure and possible fines or changes in business practices, which generally have a negative impact on stock prices. However, the actual financial impact is uncertain and depends on the outcome of the probe. Given the nature of the news, it is likely to create short-term uncertainty and potentially negative sentiment around AAPL stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's update on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in their fourth-quarter 2024 investor letter. The letter expresses concerns about the overall valuation of the market and mentions that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59% and its shares gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks. Considering this information, it seems that the market sentiment towards Apple is neutral to slightly negative, which may lead to a decrease in stock price. However, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand and a large market capitalization, which could help maintain its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
