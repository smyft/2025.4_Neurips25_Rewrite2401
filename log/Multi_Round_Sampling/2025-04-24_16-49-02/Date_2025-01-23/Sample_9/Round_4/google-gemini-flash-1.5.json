(AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, \u201cI think that, regardless, it\u2019s a very pro-business regime.\u201d He explained that his view came despite \u201ca story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].\u201d According to Cramer, the story \u201cis the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it\u2019s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump\u2019s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President\u2019s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. \u201cWell look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down \u2019cause he\u2019s going to get us to pump more,\u201d Cramer outlined. \u201cAnd I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that\u2019s front and center,\u201d he added. However, Cramer cautioned that \u201c[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they\u2019re being told, drill. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll respond to that. I just don\u2019t think that they will.\u201d\n\nContinuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs \u201cmore pipe[line], we\u2019re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.\u201d He outlined that President Trump \u201cbasically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.\u201d Cramer believes that the move was necessary \u201c[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don\u2019t have a lot of what\u2019s known as trains. We don\u2019t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can\u2019t ship more, as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of, facilities. And we don\u2019t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. \u201cSo far China kind of got off the hook,\u201d he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, \u201c[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we\u2019re going to put some guys in. They\u2019re going to make a difference. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it\u2019s the deep state. But you know what I\u2019m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government\u2019s operations. \u201cIt could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he shared.\n\nHe also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. \u201cWhen the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,\u201d Cramer shared. According to him, \u201c[h]e [Biden] wasn\u2019t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn\u2019t like em. He didn\u2019t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That\u2019s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!\u201d\n\nShifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok\u2019s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, \u201c[t]hey handed down, the only time I\u2019ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.\u201d He added according to the court\u2019s opinion, it was clear that \u201cthere is a huge national security risk.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, \u201cRight, but I\u2019m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.\u201d Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, \u201c[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.\u201d\n\nHe also commented on whether there\u2019s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. \u201cThere is! The Supreme Court says it\u2019s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it\u2019s a front door,\u201d Cramer believes. He added, \u201cI think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn\u2019t use that term, but he meant it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nConsumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that\u2019s regularly on Cramer\u2019s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs\u2019 death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s gonna miss big. I mean I can\u2019t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven\u2019t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter\u2019s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It\u2019s really. . . .I mean AI\u2019s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how\u2019s Apple gonna do. And they\u2019re gonna say it. They\u2019re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it\u2019s not a surprise! Okay. They\u2019re acting like it\u2019s, they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s the Commanders.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which remains a core holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The focus on AI and Apple's recent advancements in integrating AI into its products suggests a positive outlook for the company. Given Buffett's historical success in stock selection and the growing importance of AI in technology, there is a strong likelihood that investor sentiment will be favorable, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the recent selling of a portion of Apple's shares by Berkshire may introduce some uncertainty, but overall, the positive developments in AI integration outweigh this concern.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's current market capitalization lead, it highlights several headwinds: slowing growth in the saturated smartphone market, regulatory pressures in the US, and challenges in China due to the lack of a local partner for Apple Intelligence. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth driven by strong demand for AI GPUs and boasts significantly higher gross profit margins. The article suggests Nvidia's outlook for 2025 is stronger. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's stock advisor team doesn't consider Nvidia as one of the best stocks to buy now. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings expectations, citing weakening China orders and the underperformance of AI initiatives.  While Cramer acknowledges Apple's AI innovation, his strong negative sentiment regarding the upcoming earnings and guidance significantly outweighs any positive aspects.  The article also highlights the widespread negative sentiment surrounding Apple's performance, suggesting a consensus view of an earnings miss.  This negative outlook from a prominent financial commentator, coupled with the general expectation of poor performance, increases the likelihood of a stock price decline.  However, it's important to note that Cramer's predictions are not always accurate, and other factors could influence the stock price.  Therefore, while the probability of a price fall is higher, a price rise is still possible due to unforeseen positive developments or market-wide trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic and suggests a bullish sentiment towards the stock, which could attract investor interest. However, the content does not provide specific fundamental or technical details about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. The headline's tone may influence short-term sentiment, but without concrete data or catalysts, the impact is likely limited. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain moderate due to the lack of substantive information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased regulatory pressure and possible fines or changes in business practices, which generally have a negative impact on stock prices. However, the actual financial impact is uncertain and depends on the outcome of the probe. Given the nature of the news, it is likely to create short-term uncertainty and potentially negative sentiment around AAPL stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's update on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in their fourth-quarter 2024 investor letter. The letter expresses concerns about the overall valuation of the market and mentions that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59% and its shares gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks. Considering this information, it seems that the market sentiment towards Apple is neutral to slightly negative, which may lead to a decrease in stock price. However, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand and a large market capitalization, which could help maintain its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, emphasizing its role in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and the company's advancements in AI technology. While there are concerns about recent share sales and potential headwinds in the market, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong position in the AI space and its large user base. This suggests a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation despite some uncertainties. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a scenario where Nvidia could potentially surpass Apple as the world's largest company in 2025. While Apple currently holds the top spot, the article highlights several factors favoring Nvidia's growth, including its leadership in AI GPUs, higher gross profit margins, and stronger revenue growth. Apple, on the other hand, faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US. The article suggests that Nvidia's outlook for 2025 is stronger than Apple's. Considering these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling relative to Nvidia's. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, but the more recent ones lean towards a negative outlook for Apple. Given the current news and the trend in previous predictions, I believe the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings, citing weak China orders and AI underperformance.  While the article mentions Apple's AI innovation, the overwhelmingly negative sentiment from a prominent financial commentator, coupled with the expectation of poor earnings and guidance, significantly weighs on the outlook.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price increase due to factors like Warren Buffett's investment, while others predict a fall based on Cramer's assessment and other market concerns.  Considering the weight of Cramer's negative prediction and the lack of strong countervailing positive news in this specific article, the probability of a price fall is higher. However, Apple is a large, established company, and the market reaction might be less dramatic than a smaller company. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall but acknowledging the possibility of a less significant price rise due to other market factors or unforeseen positive developments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic, suggesting a bullish sentiment towards Apple Inc.

Taking into account the mixed outlook and the concerns about valuation, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple Inc.

Cramer's negative outlook, combined with the widespread expectation of poor performance and the recent predictions from other models indicating a higher probability of stock price decline, suggest a bearish sentiment among investors. Although Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand, the current negative outlook could outweigh these positives, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, emphasizing its role in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and the company's advancements in AI technology. While there are concerns about recent share sales and potential headwinds in the market, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong position in the AI space and its large user base. However, mixed predictions from previous analyses indicate some bearish sentiment due to regulatory pressures and concerns about growth in China. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise, but with a notable chance of decline due to the existing uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article directly compares Apple to Nvidia, suggesting Nvidia could surpass Apple in market capitalization in 2025.

However, the consistent negative predictions in the later rounds, particularly those emphasizing Cramer's view and the weak China orders, are concerning.  While Apple is a large, established company, the potential for a significant earnings miss and the negative market sentiment outweigh the positive factors in this specific news piece.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the possibility of a less significant price rise due to other market factors or unforeseen positive developments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic, suggesting a bullish sentiment towards Apple Inc.

The previous predictions from other models also indicate a mixed outlook, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall due to regulatory scrutiny, negative sentiment, and high valuation, while others predict a higher probability of a stock price rise due to the company's strong brand and potential for AI innovation. Taking into account the mixed outlook and the concerns about valuation, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations due to issues with AI innovation and a significant drop in orders from China. Multiple previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a negative outlook for Apple, with factors such as regulatory pressures, negative market sentiment, and concerns about growth in China contributing to a pessimistic view. Cramer's strong negative sentiment and the lack of compelling positive news in this specific article weigh heavily on the probability of a stock price decline. However, Apple's strong brand and market position suggest that the impact may not be as severe as that of a smaller company.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This negative sentiment from a prominent financial commentator carries significant weight. While the article acknowledges Apple's AI innovation and mentions Warren Buffett's past investment, the overall tone is bearish.  The previous predictions show a consistent shift towards a more negative outlook for Apple, with most models predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall.  Factors contributing to this negative sentiment include concerns about earnings, regulatory pressures (though not directly mentioned in this specific news), and the comparison to Nvidia's stronger growth in the AI sector.  While Apple is a large, established company, the potential for a significant earnings miss and the negative market sentiment outweigh the positive factors in this specific news piece.  The consistent negative predictions across multiple rounds, emphasizing Cramer's view and the weak China orders, are particularly concerning. Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the possibility of a less significant price rise due to other market factors or unforeseen positive developments.  The trend in previous predictions strongly supports a bearish outlook.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc.
