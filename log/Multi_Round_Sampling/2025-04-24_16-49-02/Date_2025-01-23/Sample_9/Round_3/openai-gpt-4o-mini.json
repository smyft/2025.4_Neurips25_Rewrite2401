(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which remains a core holding in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The focus on AI and Apple's recent advancements in integrating AI into its products suggests a positive outlook for the company. Given Buffett's historical success in stock selection and the growing importance of AI in technology, there is a strong likelihood that investor sentiment will be favorable, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the recent selling of a portion of Apple's shares by Berkshire may introduce some uncertainty, but overall, the positive developments in AI integration outweigh this concern.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's current market capitalization lead, it highlights several headwinds: slowing growth in the saturated smartphone market, regulatory pressures in the US, and challenges in China due to the lack of a local partner for Apple Intelligence. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth driven by strong demand for AI GPUs and boasts significantly higher gross profit margins. The article suggests Nvidia's outlook for 2025 is stronger. However, the article also mentions that Motley Fool's stock advisor team doesn't consider Nvidia as one of the best stocks to buy now. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings expectations, citing weakening China orders and the underperformance of AI initiatives.  While Cramer acknowledges Apple's AI innovation, his strong negative sentiment regarding the upcoming earnings and guidance significantly outweighs any positive aspects.  The article also highlights the widespread negative sentiment surrounding Apple's performance, suggesting a consensus view of an earnings miss.  This negative outlook from a prominent financial commentator, coupled with the general expectation of poor performance, increases the likelihood of a stock price decline.  However, it's important to note that Cramer's predictions are not always accurate, and other factors could influence the stock price.  Therefore, while the probability of a price fall is higher, a price rise is still possible due to unforeseen positive developments or market-wide trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic and suggests a bullish sentiment towards the stock, which could attract investor interest. However, the content does not provide specific fundamental or technical details about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly impact its stock price. The headline's tone may influence short-term sentiment, but without concrete data or catalysts, the impact is likely limited. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but both probabilities remain moderate due to the lack of substantive information.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet's Google are facing a UK probe into mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially lead to increased regulatory pressure and possible fines or changes in business practices, which generally have a negative impact on stock prices. However, the actual financial impact is uncertain and depends on the outcome of the probe. Given the nature of the news, it is likely to create short-term uncertainty and potentially negative sentiment around AAPL stock.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's update on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in their fourth-quarter 2024 investor letter. The letter expresses concerns about the overall valuation of the market and mentions that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive'. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59% and its shares gained 15.28% over the last 52 weeks. Considering this information, it seems that the market sentiment towards Apple is neutral to slightly negative, which may lead to a decrease in stock price. However, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand and a large market capitalization, which could help maintain its stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, emphasizing its role in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and the company's advancements in AI technology. While there are concerns about recent share sales and potential headwinds in the market, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong position in the AI space and its large user base. This suggests a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation despite some uncertainties. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a scenario where Nvidia could potentially surpass Apple as the world's largest company in 2025. While Apple currently holds the top spot, the article highlights several factors favoring Nvidia's growth, including its leadership in AI GPUs, higher gross profit margins, and stronger revenue growth. Apple, on the other hand, faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US. The article suggests that Nvidia's outlook for 2025 is stronger than Apple's. Considering these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling relative to Nvidia's. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, but the more recent ones lean towards a negative outlook for Apple. Given the current news and the trend in previous predictions, I believe the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings, citing weak China orders and AI underperformance.  While the article mentions Apple's AI innovation, the overwhelmingly negative sentiment from a prominent financial commentator, coupled with the expectation of poor earnings and guidance, significantly weighs on the outlook.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price increase due to factors like Warren Buffett's investment, while others predict a fall based on Cramer's assessment and other market concerns.  Considering the weight of Cramer's negative prediction and the lack of strong countervailing positive news in this specific article, the probability of a price fall is higher. However, Apple is a large, established company, and the market reaction might be less dramatic than a smaller company. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall but acknowledging the possibility of a less significant price rise due to other market factors or unforeseen positive developments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic, suggesting a bullish sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), which could attract investor interest. However, the content lacks specific fundamental or technical details that would directly impact the stock price.

The consensus leans slightly towards a negative sentiment, but the headline's tone may provide some short-term support. Considering the lack of concrete data and the mixed signals from previous analyses, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news headline indicates that Apple Inc.

Given the nature of the news, it is likely to create short-term uncertainty and potentially negative sentiment around AAPL stock.

However, Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand and a large market capitalization, which could help maintain its stock price. The previous predictions from other models also indicate a mixed outlook, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall due to regulatory scrutiny, negative sentiment, and high valuation, while others predict a higher probability of a stock price rise due to the company's strong brand and potential for AI innovation. Taking into account the mixed outlook and the concerns about valuation, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations due to issues with AI innovation and a significant drop in orders from China. Cramer's negative outlook, combined with the widespread expectation of poor performance and the recent predictions from other models indicating a higher probability of stock price decline, suggest a bearish sentiment among investors. Although Apple is a well-established company with a strong brand, the current negative outlook could outweigh these positives, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, emphasizing its role in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio and the company's advancements in AI technology. While there are concerns about recent share sales and potential headwinds in the market, the overall sentiment remains positive due to Apple's strong position in the AI space and its large user base. However, mixed predictions from previous analyses indicate some bearish sentiment due to regulatory pressures and concerns about growth in China. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise, but with a notable chance of decline due to the existing uncertainties.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article directly compares Apple to Nvidia, suggesting Nvidia could surpass Apple in market capitalization in 2025. It highlights Nvidia's stronger growth prospects due to AI demand and higher profit margins, while Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory challenges. The previous rounds of predictions show a shift towards a more negative outlook for Apple, with most models predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Considering the negative sentiment in the news and the trend in previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses heavily on Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings, citing weak China orders and AI underperformance.

The previous predictions show a mixed outlook, with some models leaning towards a price increase due to factors like Warren Buffett's investment and others predicting a fall based on Cramer's assessment and other market concerns.  However, the consistent negative predictions in the later rounds, particularly those emphasizing Cramer's view and the weak China orders, are concerning.  While Apple is a large, established company, the potential for a significant earnings miss and the negative market sentiment outweigh the positive factors in this specific news piece.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the possibility of a less significant price rise due to other market factors or unforeseen positive developments.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline is optimistic, suggesting a bullish sentiment towards Apple Inc.
