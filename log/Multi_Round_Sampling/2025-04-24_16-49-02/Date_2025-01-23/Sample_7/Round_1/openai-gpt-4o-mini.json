A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple's iPhone through the launch of the Galaxy S25, which incorporates advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology. While this could pose a competitive threat to Apple, the luxury smartphone market remains a stronghold for Apple, and the company has a loyal customer base. Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's product offerings or market position. Therefore, while there is some risk of a slight decline in stock price due to increased competition, the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic for Apple. Hence, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of stability or slight rise rather than a significant fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary driver for the stock price movement is Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings and provide weak guidance. This negative sentiment, coupled with concerns about declining China orders and the perceived lack of AI innovation, suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline. While the article also discusses broader market factors and political events, the direct commentary on Apple's earnings prospects carries the most weight. The article also mentions that 'everyone' expects Apple to miss, which could mean that the market has already priced in some of the negative sentiment. However, Cramer's strong conviction suggests further downside potential.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store in the EU and globally, while temporarily subsidizing Apple's fees for developers, is indirectly relevant to Apple.  While it presents increased competition for Apple's App Store, the impact is likely to be limited.  Epic Games' mobile store user base is significantly smaller than Apple's, and the focus is on the EU initially.  Apple's App Store revenue is a substantial part of its overall revenue, but the news doesn't suggest a major immediate threat.  The fact that Apple approved Epic's app suggests a degree of acceptance of the competitive landscape.  Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement (either up or down) due to this news alone is low.  Any price movement is more likely to be a minor fluctuation within the context of broader market trends rather than a direct result of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to integrate Google AI and Qualcomm technology into its Galaxy S25 to compete with Apple's iPhone 17 Air. While this indicates increased competition for Apple in the smartphone market, the impact on Apple's stock price is nuanced. Apple's strong brand loyalty, ecosystem, and the upcoming iPhone 17 Air with Apple Intelligence AI features may mitigate negative effects. However, the competitive pressure from Samsung could lead to concerns about market share erosion. Given Apple's diversified revenue streams (services, wearables) and its historical resilience, the immediate negative impact might be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's investor letter, which highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of its holdings. However, the letter also expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating a recent decline in stock price. Despite this, the article does not provide any specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the concerns about valuation and recent price decline are more likely to impact the stock price negatively than positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains, potentially even making an investor a millionaire. This kind of optimistic forecasting can boost investor confidence and attract new investors, which typically leads to an increase in stock price. However, the content provided does not offer specific details about the company's current performance, future plans, or any challenges it might be facing. Despite this lack of detail, the overall tone of the headline is bullish, which can influence market sentiment positively.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute could potentially increase competition and regulatory scrutiny, which could impact Apple's revenue from app store services. However, Epic Games' actions might also drive innovation and bring positive changes to the market. Considering these factors, there is a moderate level of uncertainty affecting Apple's stock.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
