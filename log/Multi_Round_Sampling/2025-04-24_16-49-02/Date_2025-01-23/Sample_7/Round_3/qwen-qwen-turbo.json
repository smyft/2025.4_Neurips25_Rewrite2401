(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games Ramps Up\u00a0Apple, Google Fight With Third-Party\u00a0Game Titles\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple's iPhone through the launch of the Galaxy S25, which incorporates advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology. While this could pose a competitive threat to Apple, the luxury smartphone market remains a stronghold for Apple, and the company has a loyal customer base. Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's product offerings or market position. Therefore, while there is some risk of a slight decline in stock price due to increased competition, the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic for Apple. Hence, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of stability or slight rise rather than a significant fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary driver for the stock price movement is Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings and provide weak guidance. This negative sentiment, coupled with concerns about declining China orders and the perceived lack of AI innovation, suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline. While the article also discusses broader market factors and political events, the direct commentary on Apple's earnings prospects carries the most weight. The article also mentions that 'everyone' expects Apple to miss, which could mean that the market has already priced in some of the negative sentiment. However, Cramer's strong conviction suggests further downside potential.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store in the EU and globally, while temporarily subsidizing Apple's fees for developers, is indirectly relevant to Apple.  While it presents increased competition for Apple's App Store, the impact is likely to be limited.  Epic Games' mobile store user base is significantly smaller than Apple's, and the focus is on the EU initially.  Apple's App Store revenue is a substantial part of its overall revenue, but the news doesn't suggest a major immediate threat.  The fact that Apple approved Epic's app suggests a degree of acceptance of the competitive landscape.  Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement (either up or down) due to this news alone is low.  Any price movement is more likely to be a minor fluctuation within the context of broader market trends rather than a direct result of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to integrate Google AI and Qualcomm technology into its Galaxy S25 to compete with Apple's iPhone 17 Air. While this indicates increased competition for Apple in the smartphone market, the impact on Apple's stock price is nuanced. Apple's strong brand loyalty, ecosystem, and the upcoming iPhone 17 Air with Apple Intelligence AI features may mitigate negative effects. However, the competitive pressure from Samsung could lead to concerns about market share erosion. Given Apple's diversified revenue streams (services, wearables) and its historical resilience, the immediate negative impact might be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's investor letter, which highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of its holdings. However, the letter also expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating a recent decline in stock price. Despite this, the article does not provide any specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the concerns about valuation and recent price decline are more likely to impact the stock price negatively than positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains, potentially even making an investor a millionaire. This kind of optimistic forecasting can boost investor confidence and attract new investors, which typically leads to an increase in stock price. However, the content provided does not offer specific details about the company's current performance, future plans, or any challenges it might be facing. Despite this lack of detail, the overall tone of the headline is bullish, which can influence market sentiment positively.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute could potentially increase competition and regulatory scrutiny, which could impact Apple's revenue from app store services. However, Epic Games' actions might also drive innovation and bring positive changes to the market. Considering these factors, there is a moderate level of uncertainty affecting Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to enhance its Galaxy S25 with advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology, which poses a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, established ecosystem, and the anticipated launch of the iPhone 17 Air with its own AI capabilities may mitigate the negative impact. While there is increased competition, the luxury smartphone market remains a stronghold for Apple, and the overall sentiment is mixed. Given the competitive landscape and potential concerns about market share, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The primary driver for the stock price movement is Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple's upcoming earnings. He believes Apple will miss earnings and provide weak guidance, citing declining China orders and a lack of AI innovation. This negative sentiment is a strong indicator of a potential stock price decline. While the article also discusses broader market factors and political events, Cramer's direct commentary on Apple's earnings prospects carries the most weight. The fact that Cramer believes 'everyone' expects Apple to miss earnings suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative sentiment, but his strong conviction suggests further downside potential. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that the news is negative for Apple. Therefore, I will assign a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term.  While it represents increased competition, Epic's market share is currently minuscule compared to Apple's App Store.  The fact that Apple approved Epic's app suggests a degree of confidence in their ability to withstand this competition.  The temporary subsidy of Apple's fees by Epic for developers in their program is a minor factor.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price, influenced more by broader market factors and overall economic sentiment than this specific news.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) directly attributable to this news is low.  The probabilities below reflect a slight bias towards no change, given the limited impact of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to integrate Google AI and Qualcomm technology into its Galaxy S25 to compete with Apple's iPhone 17 Air.

The competitive pressure from Samsung could lead to concerns about market share erosion, but Apple's diversified revenue streams (services, wearables) and its historical resilience suggest the immediate negative impact might be limited. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a slight decline due to competition, while others remain cautiously optimistic. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's investor letter, which mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of its holdings. However, the letter also expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating a recent decline in stock price. Despite this, the article does not provide any specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. The mixed sentiment from various models in previous rounds also indicates uncertainty, with predictions ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for both rising and falling probabilities. Considering these factors, it seems that the concerns about valuation and recent price decline are more likely to impact the stock price negatively than positively, but the presence of positive predictions suggests a balanced view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains. This kind of optimistic forecasting can boost investor confidence and attract new investors, which typically leads to an increase in stock price. Although the content provided does not offer specific details about the company's current performance, future plans, or any challenges it might be facing, the overall tone of the headline is bullish, which can influence market sentiment positively. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mix of opinions, but the majority seem to be cautiously optimistic or neutral. However, the lack of specific negative information in the provided news and the generally positive tone lead me to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute presents a competitive challenge for Apple, as Epic Games is expanding its mobile marketplace with third-party game titles, which could increase competition for Apple's App Store. Although the impact on Apple's App Store revenue is not expected to be immediate or significant, it introduces regulatory and market pressures. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models predicting a slight rise based on optimism, while others predict a fall due to concerns about valuation and recent declines. Considering the added legal and competitive pressures along with the mixed sentiment from other predictions, the probability of a stock price change remains uncertain but slightly skewed towards a modest decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to enhance its Galaxy S25 with advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology, which poses a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone.

Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a slight decline due to competition, while others remain cautiously optimistic. Given the competitive landscape and potential concerns about market share, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The primary driver for this prediction is Jim Cramer's statement that Apple will miss earnings and provide weak guidance. He cites declining China orders and a lack of AI innovation as key reasons. This is a significantly negative signal. While the article also discusses broader market factors, Cramer's direct commentary on Apple's earnings carries the most weight. The fact that Cramer believes 'everyone' expects Apple to miss earnings suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative sentiment, but his strong conviction suggests further downside potential. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that the news is negative for Apple, with the probability of a fall consistently higher than a rise. I am increasing the probability of a fall to reflect the continued negative sentiment and Cramer's strong conviction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store in the EU and globally is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term.

Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) directly attributable to this news is low.  I've considered the overall trend of previous predictions, which show a slight leaning towards a stock price decline, but I believe the impact of this specific news is minimal.  The probabilities below reflect this assessment of limited impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to enhance its Galaxy S25 with advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology, posing a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone.

Additionally, there is mention of a recent stock price decline and the competitive pressure from Samsung's integration of advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology into its Galaxy S25. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diversified revenue streams, and historical resilience suggest that the immediate negative impact might be limited. Considering the mixed sentiments and the competitive landscape, there seems to be a balanced view with a slight inclination towards a potential decline due to valuation concerns and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains.
