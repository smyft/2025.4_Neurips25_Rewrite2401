      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games kicks off plan to add third-party games to own mobile store\nNews Content: (Reuters) - \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games said on Thursday it will add 19 third-party games to its own marketplace app on Google's Android globally and 16 games on Apple's iOS in the European Union.\n\nThe videogame company had launched its mobile game store in 2024, allowing it to avoid fees imposed by conventional app marketplaces such as Google's Play and Apple's App Store while making in-app purchases.\n\nEpic Games had also argued that users did not have much choice beyond the two popular app stores for downloading gaming applications, suppressing competition.\n\nIt will launch a program to offer free games on its mobile store, starting with titles such as \"Bloons TD 6\" and \"Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee\".\n\nThe company said it would temporarily cover core technology fees, the 0.50 euros ($0.5210) charged by Apple on every app after it crosses 1 million installs, for developers that participate in Epic's free-games program in Europe.\n\n\"We are opening up the Epic Games Store to mobile games from third parties, starting with a small catalog and expanding over time to a very big catalog,\" CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters.\n\n\"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores and different places, but to build a single cross-platform store.\"\n\nNorth Carolina-based Epic Games reached 29 million users for its mobile store by end-2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users.\n\nThe company also offers a computer graphics software, called \"Unreal Engine\", which is widely used by app developers to design and develop games.\n\nApple had approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe last year. Epic had faced off with Google and Apple over their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on app store payments.\n\nAfter getting banned for nearly four years, Epic's \"Fortnite\" returned on iPhones in the European Union and Android devices globally.\n\n($1 = 0.9598 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple's iPhone through the launch of the Galaxy S25, which incorporates advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology. While this could pose a competitive threat to Apple, the luxury smartphone market remains a stronghold for Apple, and the company has a loyal customer base. Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's product offerings or market position. Therefore, while there is some risk of a slight decline in stock price due to increased competition, the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic for Apple. Hence, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of stability or slight rise rather than a significant fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary driver for the stock price movement is Jim Cramer's prediction that Apple will miss earnings and provide weak guidance. This negative sentiment, coupled with concerns about declining China orders and the perceived lack of AI innovation, suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline. While the article also discusses broader market factors and political events, the direct commentary on Apple's earnings prospects carries the most weight. The article also mentions that 'everyone' expects Apple to miss, which could mean that the market has already priced in some of the negative sentiment. However, Cramer's strong conviction suggests further downside potential.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store in the EU and globally, while temporarily subsidizing Apple's fees for developers, is indirectly relevant to Apple.  While it presents increased competition for Apple's App Store, the impact is likely to be limited.  Epic Games' mobile store user base is significantly smaller than Apple's, and the focus is on the EU initially.  Apple's App Store revenue is a substantial part of its overall revenue, but the news doesn't suggest a major immediate threat.  The fact that Apple approved Epic's app suggests a degree of acceptance of the competitive landscape.  Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement (either up or down) due to this news alone is low.  Any price movement is more likely to be a minor fluctuation within the context of broader market trends rather than a direct result of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to integrate Google AI and Qualcomm technology into its Galaxy S25 to compete with Apple's iPhone 17 Air. While this indicates increased competition for Apple in the smartphone market, the impact on Apple's stock price is nuanced. Apple's strong brand loyalty, ecosystem, and the upcoming iPhone 17 Air with Apple Intelligence AI features may mitigate negative effects. However, the competitive pressure from Samsung could lead to concerns about market share erosion. Given Apple's diversified revenue streams (services, wearables) and its historical resilience, the immediate negative impact might be limited.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article mentions Greenlight Capital's investor letter, which highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of its holdings. However, the letter also expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating a recent decline in stock price. Despite this, the article does not provide any specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. Therefore, based on the information provided, it seems that the concerns about valuation and recent price decline are more likely to impact the stock price negatively than positively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains, potentially even making an investor a millionaire. This kind of optimistic forecasting can boost investor confidence and attract new investors, which typically leads to an increase in stock price. However, the content provided does not offer specific details about the company's current performance, future plans, or any challenges it might be facing. Despite this lack of detail, the overall tone of the headline is bullish, which can influence market sentiment positively.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute could potentially increase competition and regulatory scrutiny, which could impact Apple's revenue from app store services. However, Epic Games' actions might also drive innovation and bring positive changes to the market. Considering these factors, there is a moderate level of uncertainty affecting Apple's stock.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to enhance its Galaxy S25 with advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology, which poses a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, established ecosystem, and the anticipated launch of the iPhone 17 Air with its own AI capabilities may mitigate the negative impact. While there is increased competition, the luxury smartphone market remains a stronghold for Apple, and the overall sentiment is mixed. Given the competitive landscape and potential concerns about market share, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The primary driver for the stock price movement is Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple's upcoming earnings. He believes Apple will miss earnings and provide weak guidance, citing declining China orders and a lack of AI innovation. This negative sentiment is a strong indicator of a potential stock price decline. While the article also discusses broader market factors and political events, Cramer's direct commentary on Apple's earnings prospects carries the most weight. The fact that Cramer believes 'everyone' expects Apple to miss earnings suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative sentiment, but his strong conviction suggests further downside potential. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that the news is negative for Apple. Therefore, I will assign a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term.  While it represents increased competition, Epic's market share is currently minuscule compared to Apple's App Store.  The fact that Apple approved Epic's app suggests a degree of confidence in their ability to withstand this competition.  The temporary subsidy of Apple's fees by Epic for developers in their program is a minor factor.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price, influenced more by broader market factors and overall economic sentiment than this specific news.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) directly attributable to this news is low.  The probabilities below reflect a slight bias towards no change, given the limited impact of this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to integrate Google AI and Qualcomm technology into its Galaxy S25 to compete with Apple's iPhone 17 Air. While this indicates increased competition for Apple in the smartphone market, Apple's strong brand loyalty, ecosystem, and the upcoming iPhone 17 Air with Apple Intelligence AI features may mitigate negative effects. The competitive pressure from Samsung could lead to concerns about market share erosion, but Apple's diversified revenue streams (services, wearables) and its historical resilience suggest the immediate negative impact might be limited. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a slight decline due to competition, while others remain cautiously optimistic. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Greenlight Capital's investor letter, which mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of its holdings. However, the letter also expresses concerns about the overall market valuation and notes that Apple's stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating a recent decline in stock price. Despite this, the article does not provide any specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. The mixed sentiment from various models in previous rounds also indicates uncertainty, with predictions ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 for both rising and falling probabilities. Considering these factors, it seems that the concerns about valuation and recent price decline are more likely to impact the stock price negatively than positively, but the presence of positive predictions suggests a balanced view.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains. This kind of optimistic forecasting can boost investor confidence and attract new investors, which typically leads to an increase in stock price. Although the content provided does not offer specific details about the company's current performance, future plans, or any challenges it might be facing, the overall tone of the headline is bullish, which can influence market sentiment positively. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mix of opinions, but the majority seem to be cautiously optimistic or neutral. However, the lack of specific negative information in the provided news and the generally positive tone lead me to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a continued legal and market battle between Apple and Epic Games over app-store fees. This ongoing dispute presents a competitive challenge for Apple, as Epic Games is expanding its mobile marketplace with third-party game titles, which could increase competition for Apple's App Store. Although the impact on Apple's App Store revenue is not expected to be immediate or significant, it introduces regulatory and market pressures. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models predicting a slight rise based on optimism, while others predict a fall due to concerns about valuation and recent declines. Considering the added legal and competitive pressures along with the mixed sentiment from other predictions, the probability of a stock price change remains uncertain but slightly skewed towards a modest decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to enhance its Galaxy S25 with advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology, which poses a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone.

Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a slight decline due to competition, while others remain cautiously optimistic. Given the competitive landscape and potential concerns about market share, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The primary driver for this prediction is Jim Cramer's statement that Apple will miss earnings and provide weak guidance. He cites declining China orders and a lack of AI innovation as key reasons. This is a significantly negative signal. While the article also discusses broader market factors, Cramer's direct commentary on Apple's earnings carries the most weight. The fact that Cramer believes 'everyone' expects Apple to miss earnings suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative sentiment, but his strong conviction suggests further downside potential. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus that the news is negative for Apple, with the probability of a fall consistently higher than a rise. I am increasing the probability of a fall to reflect the continued negative sentiment and Cramer's strong conviction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store in the EU and globally is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term.

Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (up or down) directly attributable to this news is low.  I've considered the overall trend of previous predictions, which show a slight leaning towards a stock price decline, but I believe the impact of this specific news is minimal.  The probabilities below reflect this assessment of limited impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to enhance its Galaxy S25 with advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology, posing a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone.

Additionally, there is mention of a recent stock price decline and the competitive pressure from Samsung's integration of advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology into its Galaxy S25. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diversified revenue streams, and historical resilience suggest that the immediate negative impact might be limited. Considering the mixed sentiments and the competitive landscape, there seems to be a balanced view with a slight inclination towards a potential decline due to valuation concerns and competitive pressures.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline 'Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?' suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc., implying that investing in the company could lead to significant financial gains.

He believes Apple will miss earnings and provide weak guidance, citing declining China orders and a lack of AI innovation as key reasons. This is a significantly negative signal. While the article also discusses broader market factors, Cramer's direct commentary on Apple's earnings carries the most weight.

I am increasing the probability of a fall to reflect the continued negative sentiment and Cramer's strong conviction. The previous rounds show a trend of increasing probability of stock price falling. Therefore, I will further increase the probability of stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile game store is relatively minor in the context of Apple's overall business. While it represents increased competition, Epic's current market share is insignificant compared to Apple's App Store dominance.  Apple's approval of Epic's app suggests confidence in their ability to withstand this competition. The temporary fee subsidy from Epic is also a negligible factor.  However, the previous predictions reveal a significant divergence of opinion, with some models highlighting negative factors like Jim Cramer's bearish outlook on Apple's earnings and increased competition from Samsung, while others focus on Apple's strong brand loyalty and diversified revenue streams.  The overall sentiment is mixed and uncertain.  Considering the lack of a significant direct impact from the Epic Games news and the conflicting predictions based on other factors, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both price increase and decrease, slightly leaning towards a decline due to the weight of the negative predictions in previous rounds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's strategic move to enhance its Galaxy S25 with advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology, posing a competitive threat to Apple's iPhone.
