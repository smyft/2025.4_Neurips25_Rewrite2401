(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The headline suggests a positive outlook on the stock market, particularly for Apple Inc. (AAPL), which may attract investor interest. The phrase 'Bull Market Buy' implies that the stock is seen as a good investment opportunity, potentially leading to increased buying pressure. However, without specific details on earnings, product launches, or market conditions, the analysis remains somewhat speculative. Overall, the sentiment appears bullish, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary driver of the stock price prediction is Jim Cramer's statement that Apple will miss earnings and that guidance will be poor. He cites AI not working and plummeting China orders as reasons. While Cramer's opinions are not always accurate, his pronouncements often influence short-term market sentiment. The article also mentions Zuckerberg's comments about Apple's innovation stagnation, which adds to the negative sentiment. The article does not present any counterarguments or positive catalysts for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting perspectives on Apple's future.  Jefferies downgrades Apple due to weak iPhone sales expectations and concerns about the AI strategy rollout.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, highlighting manageable China unit declines, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The disagreement between these reputable firms suggests significant uncertainty. While the short-term outlook appears bearish due to immediate sales concerns, the long-term potential of AI integration and the Wedbush's bullish price target of $325 (significantly higher than the current price) suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long term.  The current market reaction is mixed, with a slight upward movement after a recent drop.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish sentiment, but acknowledge the significant short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple remains a top holding among hedge funds, and its revenue showed a 6% year-over-year increase in the September quarter. However, Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about market valuations, and Dan Niles from the firm notes that Apple's data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent underperformance. The focus on AI stocks as more promising investments could divert attention and capital away from Apple. Given these factors, the sentiment appears more negative than positive in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article mentions that Epic Games is planning to introduce third-party games on its own app marketplace, which could potentially challenge Apple's (AAPL) dominance in the app store market. This development might negatively impact Apple's stock price as it could lead to increased competition and potentially reduced revenue from its App Store. However, it's worth noting that Apple's App Store still holds a significant market share and its loyal customer base. The impact of this news on Apple's stock price is uncertain, but it seems more likely to have a negative effect due to potential loss of market share and revenue.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's investment in four AI-focused stocks, including Apple, which accounts for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The article emphasizes Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, such as the Apple Intelligence software and the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT in Siri. Given Buffett's reputation as a savvy investor and Apple's significant investment in AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple could become the largest distributor of AI to consumers, which could lead to long-term growth and increased demand for its products.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights ongoing tensions between the U.S. and the EU over antitrust issues with American tech giants, particularly Apple. While Trump's defense of these companies provides some reassurance, it does not mitigate the significant fines and regulatory actions already imposed. The recent fine on Apple and ongoing litigation could weigh negatively on investor sentiment, potentially leading to a decrease in stock price. However, Trump's stance might provide some short-term relief.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The headline suggests a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a bull market, which typically encourages investor optimism. However, previous predictions indicate a mix of sentiments, with some analysts expressing concerns about earnings misses and competitive pressures. The overall sentiment from the headline leans towards bullishness, but the mixed signals from other analyses suggest caution. Given the positive framing of the news and the potential for increased investor interest, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, while still acknowledging the significant risks highlighted by other analysts.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple's upcoming earnings, citing concerns about AI and declining China orders. While the article also touches on broader market and political factors, the core message regarding Apple is bearish. Considering Cramer's influence on market sentiment, this negative commentary is likely to exert downward pressure on the stock. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, but the most recent ones lean towards a negative outlook. Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While short-term concerns exist regarding weaker iPhone sales and a perceived late entry into the AI market, several factors suggest a more nuanced picture. Wedbush's bullish outlook and $325 price target, significantly above the current price, counterbalance the negative sentiment from Jefferies.  The potential for a major AI partnership in China and the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence offer significant upside.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term performance. However, the long-term bullish case presented by Wedbush, coupled with the potential for significant AI growth, suggests a higher probability of a price rise in the medium to long term, despite the short-term headwinds.  The current slight upward movement in the stock price after a recent drop also supports this view.  Considering the conflicting information and the uncertainty inherent in stock market predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, acknowledging the significant short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, Apple remains a top holding among hedge funds, with 158 hedge fund portfolios holding the stock at the end of Q3 2024, and it reported a 6% year-over-year revenue increase in the September quarter. However, Greenlight Capital expresses concerns about overall market valuations and specifically mentions Apple's data as 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock as 'pretty expensive.' Additionally, Apple's one-month return was -13.59%, indicating recent underperformance. The focus on AI stocks as more promising investments could divert attention and capital away from Apple. Given these factors, the sentiment appears more negative than positive in the short term, though the long-term potential remains uncertain.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that Epic Games is planning to introduce third-party games on its own app marketplace, potentially challenging Apple's dominance in the app store market. This development could negatively impact Apple's stock price due to increased competition and potential reduced revenue from its App Store. However, Apple's App Store still holds a significant market share and has a loyal customer base, which might mitigate the negative impact. Considering the mixed predictions from previous models, with some indicating a potential rise in stock price due to long-term growth prospects and others predicting a fall due to short-term risks and competition, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising at 0.4 and the probability of the stock price falling at 0.6.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant investment in Apple, which accounts for 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. The article emphasizes Apple's efforts to integrate AI into its products and services, such as the Apple Intelligence software and the use of OpenAI's ChatGPT in Siri. Given Buffett's reputation as a savvy investor and Apple's significant investment in AI, this news is likely to have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple could become the largest distributor of AI to consumers, which could lead to long-term growth and increased demand for its products. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but the overall trend suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price due to its investment in AI and Warren Buffett's endorsement.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights ongoing tensions between the U.S. and the EU over antitrust issues with American tech giants, particularly Apple.
