(AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, \u201cI think that, regardless, it\u2019s a very pro-business regime.\u201d He explained that his view came despite \u201ca story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].\u201d According to Cramer, the story \u201cis the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it\u2019s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump\u2019s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President\u2019s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. \u201cWell look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down \u2019cause he\u2019s going to get us to pump more,\u201d Cramer outlined. \u201cAnd I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that\u2019s front and center,\u201d he added. However, Cramer cautioned that \u201c[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they\u2019re being told, drill. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll respond to that. I just don\u2019t think that they will.\u201d\n\nContinuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs \u201cmore pipe[line], we\u2019re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.\u201d He outlined that President Trump \u201cbasically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.\u201d Cramer believes that the move was necessary \u201c[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don\u2019t have a lot of what\u2019s known as trains. We don\u2019t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can\u2019t ship more, as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of, facilities. And we don\u2019t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. \u201cSo far China kind of got off the hook,\u201d he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, \u201c[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we\u2019re going to put some guys in. They\u2019re going to make a difference. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it\u2019s the deep state. But you know what I\u2019m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government\u2019s operations. \u201cIt could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he shared.\n\nHe also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. \u201cWhen the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,\u201d Cramer shared. According to him, \u201c[h]e [Biden] wasn\u2019t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn\u2019t like em. He didn\u2019t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That\u2019s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!\u201d\n\nShifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok\u2019s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, \u201c[t]hey handed down, the only time I\u2019ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.\u201d He added according to the court\u2019s opinion, it was clear that \u201cthere is a huge national security risk.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, \u201cRight, but I\u2019m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.\u201d Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, \u201c[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.\u201d\n\nHe also commented on whether there\u2019s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. \u201cThere is! The Supreme Court says it\u2019s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it\u2019s a front door,\u201d Cramer believes. He added, \u201cI think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn\u2019t use that term, but he meant it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(see more details here).Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation - Here's Why\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nConsumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that\u2019s regularly on Cramer\u2019s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs\u2019 death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s gonna miss big. I mean I can\u2019t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven\u2019t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter\u2019s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It\u2019s really. . . .I mean AI\u2019s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how\u2019s Apple gonna do. And they\u2019re gonna say it. They\u2019re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it\u2019s not a surprise! Okay. They\u2019re acting like it\u2019s, they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s the Commanders.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple's iPhone through the launch of the Galaxy S25, which incorporates advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology. While this could pose a competitive threat to Apple, the luxury smartphone market remains a stronghold for Apple. The article suggests that Samsung's previous attempts to rival Apple in the luxury segment have not been successful, indicating that the impact on Apple's stock may be limited. Additionally, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipated features of the iPhone 17 Air could mitigate any negative effects from Samsung's announcement. Therefore, while there is some risk of a stock price decline due to increased competition, the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary driver of the stock price prediction is Jim Cramer's statement that Apple will miss earnings and that guidance will be poor. He cites AI not working and plummeting China orders as reasons. While Cramer's opinions are not always accurate, his pronouncements often influence short-term market sentiment. The article also mentions Zuckerberg's comments about Apple's innovation stagnation, which adds to the negative sentiment. The article does not present any counterarguments or positive catalysts for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Oracle's (ORCL) significant investment in AI and cloud computing, not Apple (AAPL).  While there's mention of Apple facing challenges (weak iPhone sales, potential conflict with India over app store policies, and a recent stock slump), the news itself doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price. The analysis of Oracle's prospects includes skepticism from some analysts regarding the sustainability of its recent growth and high valuation.  Apple's negative trends are highlighted separately, suggesting independent downward pressure. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement is primarily determined by its own internal factors and not the Oracle news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that the Indian government is pressuring Apple and Google to host the GOV.in app suite on their app stores, with potential legal actions if they refuse. Apple's reluctance to comply could lead to regulatory risks or negative sentiment, but the impact on its stock price is likely limited because: (1) India is a smaller market for Apple compared to others like the U.S. and China; (2) the news does not directly affect Apple's revenue or earnings in the short term; (3) Apple has previously navigated similar situations (e.g., in Russia) without significant stock price impact. However, there is a slight risk of negative sentiment if the dispute escalates. Overall, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is low, with a marginally higher chance of a slight negative reaction due to regulatory uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article discusses Oracle Corp.'s joint venture and its potential impact on the cloud computing market, which could indirectly affect Apple. The news about Oracle's significant investment in AI and cloud infrastructure might increase competition in the tech sector. Given that Apple has recently faced concerns over weak iPhone sales and has been downgraded by some analysts, the indirect impact of Oracle's move might be minimal on Apple's stock price. However, the overall tech market sentiment could be influenced. Apple's stock has slumped almost 11% in January, and with no direct positive news from the article, the probabilities lean slightly towards a continued cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) upcoming earnings, citing that the company will miss big and that the guidance will be bad. He also mentions that AI innovation is not working and that China orders have plummeted. This negative sentiment from a well-known financial expert could potentially lead to a decrease in investor confidence, causing the stock price to fall. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in these concerns, or that Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base could help mitigate the impact of a potential earnings miss. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising, but not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc., along with other tech giants like Google, is facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This could potentially impact the revenue streams of these companies, particularly their App Store commissions, which are a significant part of their business. Such regulatory pressures can often lead to short-term uncertainties, causing investors to be cautious and potentially leading to a drop in stock prices. However, it's also important to consider how these companies might navigate such challenges, whether through negotiations, legal actions, or other strategies.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple's iPhone through the launch of the Galaxy S25, which incorporates advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology. While this poses a competitive threat, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipated features of the iPhone 17 Air may mitigate any negative effects. Previous predictions indicate a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a potential decline due to external pressures and competition. However, the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic for Apple, suggesting that while there is some risk of a stock price decline, the impact may be limited. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary driver for this prediction is Jim Cramer's negative sentiment regarding Apple's upcoming earnings. He believes Apple will miss earnings expectations due to poor AI performance and declining orders from China. While Cramer's opinions are not always accurate, they can significantly influence short-term market sentiment. The article also mentions Zuckerberg's past comments about Apple's innovation stagnation, which adds to the negative sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is a consistent trend of negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base could mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on Oracle's AI initiatives and its potential impact on the cloud computing market.  While there's mention of Apple facing challenges (weak iPhone sales, India regulatory pressure), the Oracle news is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock price movement.  The previous predictions highlight a range of opinions, with several models leaning towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to existing concerns about weak iPhone sales and negative analyst sentiment.  The Oracle news doesn't offer any countervailing positive factors for Apple. Therefore, I'm basing my prediction primarily on the pre-existing negative sentiment surrounding Apple, rather than the Oracle news itself. The significant slump in Apple's stock price in January further reinforces this negative outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the Indian government's request for Apple to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, with potential legal actions if Apple refuses. While this introduces regulatory risks, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited due to several factors: (1) India is a smaller market for Apple compared to the U.S. and China; (2) the news does not directly affect Apple's revenue or earnings in the short term; (3) Apple has previously navigated similar situations (e.g., in Russia) without significant stock price impact. However, there is a slight risk of negative sentiment if the dispute escalates. Overall, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is low, with a marginally higher chance of a slight negative reaction due to regulatory uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Oracle Corp.'s (ORCL) significant investment in AI and cloud computing, which could potentially increase competition in the tech sector. However, the article does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide specific information that would directly impact its stock price. Given that Apple's recent stock performance has been sluggish with an almost 11% decline in January and recent downgrades by analysts due to weak iPhone sales, the overall sentiment seems cautious. However, without direct negative news about Apple, the probabilities are not drastically skewed. Considering the lack of direct impact on Apple from the Oracle news and the existing concerns over iPhone sales and regulatory issues in India, the stock price movement probabilities seem to lean slightly towards a cautious outlook but with a low magnitude of impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) upcoming earnings, citing that the company will miss big and that the guidance will be bad. He also mentions that AI innovation is not working and that China orders have plummeted. This negative sentiment from a well-known financial expert could potentially lead to a decrease in investor confidence, causing the stock price to fall.

This regulatory pressure could negatively impact Apple's App Store commissions, a significant source of revenue. However, historical precedents suggest that such disputes may not necessarily result in immediate drastic stock price movements. The company's strong brand loyalty and potential for resilience in navigating regulatory challenges might mitigate immediate negative impacts. Multiple models predict a higher likelihood of stock price falling, citing factors such as missed earnings, negative guidance, and market sentiment driven by these concerns.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
