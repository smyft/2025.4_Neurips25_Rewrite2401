(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Oracle Takes Run at Cloud\u2019s Big Three With Trump-Backed AI Pact\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple's iPhone through the launch of the Galaxy S25, which incorporates advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology. While this could pose a competitive threat to Apple, the luxury smartphone market remains a stronghold for Apple. The article suggests that Samsung's previous attempts to rival Apple in the luxury segment have not been successful, indicating that the impact on Apple's stock may be limited. Additionally, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipated features of the iPhone 17 Air could mitigate any negative effects from Samsung's announcement. Therefore, while there is some risk of a stock price decline due to increased competition, the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary driver of the stock price prediction is Jim Cramer's statement that Apple will miss earnings and that guidance will be poor. He cites AI not working and plummeting China orders as reasons. While Cramer's opinions are not always accurate, his pronouncements often influence short-term market sentiment. The article also mentions Zuckerberg's comments about Apple's innovation stagnation, which adds to the negative sentiment. The article does not present any counterarguments or positive catalysts for Apple. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Oracle's (ORCL) significant investment in AI and cloud computing, not Apple (AAPL).  While there's mention of Apple facing challenges (weak iPhone sales, potential conflict with India over app store policies, and a recent stock slump), the news itself doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price. The analysis of Oracle's prospects includes skepticism from some analysts regarding the sustainability of its recent growth and high valuation.  Apple's negative trends are highlighted separately, suggesting independent downward pressure. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement is primarily determined by its own internal factors and not the Oracle news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that the Indian government is pressuring Apple and Google to host the GOV.in app suite on their app stores, with potential legal actions if they refuse. Apple's reluctance to comply could lead to regulatory risks or negative sentiment, but the impact on its stock price is likely limited because: (1) India is a smaller market for Apple compared to others like the U.S. and China; (2) the news does not directly affect Apple's revenue or earnings in the short term; (3) Apple has previously navigated similar situations (e.g., in Russia) without significant stock price impact. However, there is a slight risk of negative sentiment if the dispute escalates. Overall, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is low, with a marginally higher chance of a slight negative reaction due to regulatory uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article discusses Oracle Corp.'s joint venture and its potential impact on the cloud computing market, which could indirectly affect Apple. The news about Oracle's significant investment in AI and cloud infrastructure might increase competition in the tech sector. Given that Apple has recently faced concerns over weak iPhone sales and has been downgraded by some analysts, the indirect impact of Oracle's move might be minimal on Apple's stock price. However, the overall tech market sentiment could be influenced. Apple's stock has slumped almost 11% in January, and with no direct positive news from the article, the probabilities lean slightly towards a continued cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) upcoming earnings, citing that the company will miss big and that the guidance will be bad. He also mentions that AI innovation is not working and that China orders have plummeted. This negative sentiment from a well-known financial expert could potentially lead to a decrease in investor confidence, causing the stock price to fall. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in these concerns, or that Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base could help mitigate the impact of a potential earnings miss. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising, but not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc., along with other tech giants like Google, is facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This could potentially impact the revenue streams of these companies, particularly their App Store commissions, which are a significant part of their business. Such regulatory pressures can often lead to short-term uncertainties, causing investors to be cautious and potentially leading to a drop in stock prices. However, it's also important to consider how these companies might navigate such challenges, whether through negotiations, legal actions, or other strategies.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's efforts to compete with Apple's iPhone through the launch of the Galaxy S25, which incorporates advanced AI features and Qualcomm technology. While this poses a competitive threat, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipated features of the iPhone 17 Air may mitigate any negative effects. Previous predictions indicate a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a potential decline due to external pressures and competition. However, the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic for Apple, suggesting that while there is some risk of a stock price decline, the impact may be limited. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The primary driver for this prediction is Jim Cramer's negative sentiment regarding Apple's upcoming earnings. He believes Apple will miss earnings expectations due to poor AI performance and declining orders from China. While Cramer's opinions are not always accurate, they can significantly influence short-term market sentiment. The article also mentions Zuckerberg's past comments about Apple's innovation stagnation, which adds to the negative sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is a consistent trend of negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise. However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base could mitigate some of the negative impact.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The provided news focuses primarily on Oracle's AI initiatives and its potential impact on the cloud computing market.  While there's mention of Apple facing challenges (weak iPhone sales, India regulatory pressure), the Oracle news is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock price movement.  The previous predictions highlight a range of opinions, with several models leaning towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to existing concerns about weak iPhone sales and negative analyst sentiment.  The Oracle news doesn't offer any countervailing positive factors for Apple. Therefore, I'm basing my prediction primarily on the pre-existing negative sentiment surrounding Apple, rather than the Oracle news itself. The significant slump in Apple's stock price in January further reinforces this negative outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights the Indian government's request for Apple to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, with potential legal actions if Apple refuses. While this introduces regulatory risks, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely limited due to several factors: (1) India is a smaller market for Apple compared to the U.S. and China; (2) the news does not directly affect Apple's revenue or earnings in the short term; (3) Apple has previously navigated similar situations (e.g., in Russia) without significant stock price impact. However, there is a slight risk of negative sentiment if the dispute escalates. Overall, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is low, with a marginally higher chance of a slight negative reaction due to regulatory uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Oracle Corp.'s (ORCL) significant investment in AI and cloud computing, which could potentially increase competition in the tech sector. However, the article does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or provide specific information that would directly impact its stock price. Given that Apple's recent stock performance has been sluggish with an almost 11% decline in January and recent downgrades by analysts due to weak iPhone sales, the overall sentiment seems cautious. However, without direct negative news about Apple, the probabilities are not drastically skewed. Considering the lack of direct impact on Apple from the Oracle news and the existing concerns over iPhone sales and regulatory issues in India, the stock price movement probabilities seem to lean slightly towards a cautious outlook but with a low magnitude of impact.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) upcoming earnings, citing that the company will miss big and that the guidance will be bad. He also mentions that AI innovation is not working and that China orders have plummeted. This negative sentiment from a well-known financial expert could potentially lead to a decrease in investor confidence, causing the stock price to fall. However, it's also possible that the market has already factored in these concerns, or that Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base could help mitigate the impact of a potential earnings miss.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights that Apple Inc., along with other tech giants like Google, is facing pressure from India to open up their app stores. This regulatory pressure could negatively impact Apple's App Store commissions, a significant source of revenue. However, historical precedents suggest that such disputes may not necessarily result in immediate drastic stock price movements. The company's strong brand loyalty and potential for resilience in navigating regulatory challenges might mitigate immediate negative impacts. Multiple models predict a higher likelihood of stock price falling, citing factors such as missed earnings, negative guidance, and market sentiment driven by these concerns.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Samsung's competitive efforts with the Galaxy S25, which could pose a threat to Apple's market share, particularly in the luxury smartphone segment. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipated features of the iPhone 17 Air may mitigate the potential negative impact. Previous predictions indicate a mix of sentiments, with some leaning towards a decline due to external pressures and competition, while others remain cautiously optimistic about Apple's resilience. Overall, the sentiment appears to lean slightly towards a higher probability of stock price stability or a modest rise, given Apple's established market position and brand strength.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The primary driver for this prediction is Jim Cramer's negative sentiment regarding Apple's upcoming earnings, citing missed earnings, poor guidance, and issues with AI and China orders. This negative outlook from a well-known financial commentator is likely to influence market sentiment. The previous rounds of predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reinforcing this view. While Apple's brand strength and customer loyalty might offer some resistance, the weight of negative sentiment and potential earnings miss suggests a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. The fact that Cramer specifically calls out that 'everyone' expects a miss further reinforces the likelihood of a negative reaction, as the market may not have fully priced this in.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Oracle's significant AI investment and its potential impact on the cloud computing market. This news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  However, the news piece also highlights existing concerns about Apple: weak iPhone sales, potential conflict with India over app store policies, and a recent stock slump (almost 11% in January).  Several previous predictions consistently point towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to these internal factors.  Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple's earnings further reinforces this negative sentiment. While Oracle's success might indirectly impact the broader tech sector, there's no direct positive catalyst for Apple in this news. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is significantly higher than a rise, primarily driven by pre-existing negative sentiment and challenges faced by Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights regulatory pressure from the Indian government on Apple to host the GOV.in app suite on its App Store, with potential legal actions if Apple refuses.

However, there is a slight risk of negative sentiment if the dispute escalates. Previous predictions show mixed sentiment, but most lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering the limited immediate financial impact but potential regulatory risks, the probabilities are slightly skewed towards a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Oracle's significant investment in AI and cloud computing, which does not directly impact Apple's stock price. However, considering the overall tech market sentiment and Apple's recent stock performance, there seems to be a cautious outlook. The slump in Apple's stock price in January, concerns over weak iPhone sales, and potential regulatory issues in India contribute to a slightly negative sentiment. Given that there is no direct positive news from the article about Apple, but also no significant negative impact expected from Oracle's news, the probabilities seem to lean slightly towards a cautious outlook with a marginally higher chance of a slight negative reaction due to regulatory uncertainty and market competition.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's negative outlook on Apple Inc.'s (AAPL) upcoming earnings, citing that the company will miss big and that the guidance will be bad.
