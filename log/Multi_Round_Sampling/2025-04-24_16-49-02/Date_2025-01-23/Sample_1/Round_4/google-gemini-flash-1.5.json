(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 32.1% of Warren Buffett's $295 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\nNews Content: Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. If consumers prefer Epic's platform, it could lead to reduced revenue for Apple from its App Store. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a potential for a negative impact, it may not be significant enough to cause a drastic decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed message. While it acknowledges a potential lack of innovation at Apple, as suggested by Mark Zuckerberg, it also argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This suggests that the company's current performance and market position are strong enough to withstand concerns about innovation. The 'shouldn't matter to investors' part is crucial. It implies that the author believes Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem are sufficient to maintain its value. Therefore, the negative sentiment regarding innovation is somewhat mitigated. However, any negative press, even if qualified, can introduce uncertainty. I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a rise because the article argues that the lack of innovation shouldn't matter to investors, suggesting underlying strength. However, the initial negative statement from Zuckerberg and the acknowledgement of a potential innovation issue prevent a strong positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant investment in Apple (AAPL), representing 22.7% of its portfolio.  While the article mentions Berkshire Hathaway selling off a portion of its Apple holdings previously, the continued substantial investment and Apple's strategic moves into AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence software and leveraging AI across its hardware and software, are presented positively.  The article emphasizes the potential for Apple to become a major player in the consumer AI market given its large user base.  However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it discusses Buffett's AI investments across multiple companies.  Therefore, the positive impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely to be somewhat diluted.  The overall positive sentiment towards Apple's AI strategy, coupled with Buffett's continued significant investment, suggests a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate, not dramatic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other smartphone makers are facing regulatory pressure from India to open up their app stores. Regulatory pressures, especially in a significant market like India, can lead to increased operational costs, potential loss of control over proprietary ecosystems, and reduced profitability. Historically, such news tends to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential decline in stock price. However, the exact impact depends on the company's ability to negotiate or adapt to regulatory changes. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile store to include third-party games, which could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue. Additionally, Epic Games' decision to temporarily cover core technology fees for developers participating in its free-games program in Europe may attract more developers to its platform, further threatening Apple's App Store dominance. This increased competition could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the impact may be limited as Apple's business is diversified and the App Store is just one aspect of its revenue streams.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which could lead to reduced revenue from app sales. This concern is echoed in previous predictions that highlight the potential negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased competition. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diverse product offerings, and existing market position may mitigate the overall impact. Given the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the competitive threat, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline presents a nuanced view. While it acknowledges Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's innovation, it also suggests this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This implies underlying strength in Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem. However, the initial negative sentiment from Zuckerberg and the acknowledgement of a potential innovation issue prevent a strong positive outlook. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on competitive threats and regulatory pressures, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall. Others highlighted Apple's AI strategy and Warren Buffett's investment, suggesting a potential rise. Given the conflicting signals and the headline's attempt to downplay the innovation concerns, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The previous rounds show a trend towards negative sentiment, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's investment in AI-focused companies, with Apple being a significant holding (22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio). While Berkshire Hathaway previously reduced its Apple stake, the substantial remaining investment signals continued confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.  Apple's strategic moves into AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence, are highlighted as positive factors. However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it's a broader piece about Buffett's AI investments.  The positive sentiment towards Apple's AI strategy and Buffett's continued significant investment suggest a higher probability of a price rise.  However, the diluted nature of the news (covering multiple companies) and the previous reduction in Berkshire's Apple holdings temper the expected impact.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions and lack a clear consensus, I'm assigning a moderate probability to a price rise, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing regulatory pressure from India to open up its app stores, which could lead to increased operational costs and reduced control over its ecosystem. This kind of regulatory scrutiny typically heightens investor concerns and can negatively impact stock prices in the short term. While Apple's diversified business model might mitigate some of the negative effects, the immediate market reaction is likely to be cautious due to the potential for reduced profitability and increased competition. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting the general sentiment that regulatory pressures are a significant downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the ongoing tensions between the US and EU over antitrust battles with Big Tech companies, including Apple. President Trump's comments suggest that the EU's fines against US companies, such as Apple's $15 billion fine, amount to a tax on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple by reducing regulatory pressure from the US side, as Trump openly defended US tech companies against EU antitrust matters. However, the EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies, and Apple's stock price has been impacted by these regulatory actions in the past. Given the mixed implications and the ongoing nature of these regulatory battles, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile store to include third-party games and temporarily covering core technology fees for developers participating in its free-games program in Europe could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue. However, Apple's business is diversified, and the App Store is just one aspect of its revenue streams. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mixed sentiment regarding the impact of this news on Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the increased competition, while others predict a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Taking into account the potential negative impact of increased competition and the mitigating factors of Apple's diversified business and strong brand, I estimate the probability of a stock price rise to be slightly lower than the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline. Moreover, previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall. The mix of negative sentiment from a reliable source like Cramer and the broader market concerns about innovation and demand could amplify the downward pressure.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which could lead to reduced revenue from app sales.
