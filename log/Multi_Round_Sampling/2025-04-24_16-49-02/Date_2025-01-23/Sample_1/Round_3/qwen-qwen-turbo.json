(AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation \u2013 Here\u2019s Why\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, \u201cI think that, regardless, it\u2019s a very pro-business regime.\u201d He explained that his view came despite \u201ca story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].\u201d According to Cramer, the story \u201cis the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it\u2019s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump\u2019s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President\u2019s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. \u201cWell look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down \u2019cause he\u2019s going to get us to pump more,\u201d Cramer outlined. \u201cAnd I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that\u2019s front and center,\u201d he added. However, Cramer cautioned that \u201c[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they\u2019re being told, drill. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll respond to that. I just don\u2019t think that they will.\u201d\n\nContinuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs \u201cmore pipe[line], we\u2019re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.\u201d He outlined that President Trump \u201cbasically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.\u201d Cramer believes that the move was necessary \u201c[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don\u2019t have a lot of what\u2019s known as trains. We don\u2019t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can\u2019t ship more, as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of, facilities. And we don\u2019t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. \u201cSo far China kind of got off the hook,\u201d he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, \u201c[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we\u2019re going to put some guys in. They\u2019re going to make a difference. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it\u2019s the deep state. But you know what I\u2019m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government\u2019s operations. \u201cIt could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he shared.\n\nHe also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. \u201cWhen the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,\u201d Cramer shared. According to him, \u201c[h]e [Biden] wasn\u2019t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn\u2019t like em. He didn\u2019t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That\u2019s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!\u201d\n\nShifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok\u2019s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, \u201c[t]hey handed down, the only time I\u2019ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.\u201d He added according to the court\u2019s opinion, it was clear that \u201cthere is a huge national security risk.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, \u201cRight, but I\u2019m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.\u201d Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, \u201c[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.\u201d\n\nHe also commented on whether there\u2019s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. \u201cThere is! The Supreme Court says it\u2019s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it\u2019s a front door,\u201d Cramer believes. He added, \u201cI think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn\u2019t use that term, but he meant it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(see more details here).Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation - Here's Why\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nConsumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that\u2019s regularly on Cramer\u2019s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs\u2019 death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s gonna miss big. I mean I can\u2019t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven\u2019t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter\u2019s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It\u2019s really. . . .I mean AI\u2019s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how\u2019s Apple gonna do. And they\u2019re gonna say it. They\u2019re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it\u2019s not a surprise! Okay. They\u2019re acting like it\u2019s, they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s the Commanders.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. If consumers prefer Epic's platform, it could lead to reduced revenue for Apple from its App Store. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a potential for a negative impact, it may not be significant enough to cause a drastic decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed message. While it acknowledges a potential lack of innovation at Apple, as suggested by Mark Zuckerberg, it also argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This suggests that the company's current performance and market position are strong enough to withstand concerns about innovation. The 'shouldn't matter to investors' part is crucial. It implies that the author believes Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem are sufficient to maintain its value. Therefore, the negative sentiment regarding innovation is somewhat mitigated. However, any negative press, even if qualified, can introduce uncertainty. I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a rise because the article argues that the lack of innovation shouldn't matter to investors, suggesting underlying strength. However, the initial negative statement from Zuckerberg and the acknowledgement of a potential innovation issue prevent a strong positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant investment in Apple (AAPL), representing 22.7% of its portfolio.  While the article mentions Berkshire Hathaway selling off a portion of its Apple holdings previously, the continued substantial investment and Apple's strategic moves into AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence software and leveraging AI across its hardware and software, are presented positively.  The article emphasizes the potential for Apple to become a major player in the consumer AI market given its large user base.  However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it discusses Buffett's AI investments across multiple companies.  Therefore, the positive impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely to be somewhat diluted.  The overall positive sentiment towards Apple's AI strategy, coupled with Buffett's continued significant investment, suggests a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate, not dramatic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other smartphone makers are facing regulatory pressure from India to open up their app stores. Regulatory pressures, especially in a significant market like India, can lead to increased operational costs, potential loss of control over proprietary ecosystems, and reduced profitability. Historically, such news tends to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential decline in stock price. However, the exact impact depends on the company's ability to negotiate or adapt to regulatory changes. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile store to include third-party games, which could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue. Additionally, Epic Games' decision to temporarily cover core technology fees for developers participating in its free-games program in Europe may attract more developers to its platform, further threatening Apple's App Store dominance. This increased competition could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the impact may be limited as Apple's business is diversified and the App Store is just one aspect of its revenue streams.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which could lead to reduced revenue from app sales. This concern is echoed in previous predictions that highlight the potential negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased competition. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diverse product offerings, and existing market position may mitigate the overall impact. Given the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the competitive threat, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline presents a nuanced view. While it acknowledges Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's innovation, it also suggests this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This implies underlying strength in Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem. However, the initial negative sentiment from Zuckerberg and the acknowledgement of a potential innovation issue prevent a strong positive outlook. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on competitive threats and regulatory pressures, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall. Others highlighted Apple's AI strategy and Warren Buffett's investment, suggesting a potential rise. Given the conflicting signals and the headline's attempt to downplay the innovation concerns, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The previous rounds show a trend towards negative sentiment, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's investment in AI-focused companies, with Apple being a significant holding (22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio). While Berkshire Hathaway previously reduced its Apple stake, the substantial remaining investment signals continued confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.  Apple's strategic moves into AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence, are highlighted as positive factors. However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it's a broader piece about Buffett's AI investments.  The positive sentiment towards Apple's AI strategy and Buffett's continued significant investment suggest a higher probability of a price rise.  However, the diluted nature of the news (covering multiple companies) and the previous reduction in Berkshire's Apple holdings temper the expected impact.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions and lack a clear consensus, I'm assigning a moderate probability to a price rise, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing regulatory pressure from India to open up its app stores, which could lead to increased operational costs and reduced control over its ecosystem. This kind of regulatory scrutiny typically heightens investor concerns and can negatively impact stock prices in the short term. While Apple's diversified business model might mitigate some of the negative effects, the immediate market reaction is likely to be cautious due to the potential for reduced profitability and increased competition. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting the general sentiment that regulatory pressures are a significant downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the ongoing tensions between the US and EU over antitrust battles with Big Tech companies, including Apple. President Trump's comments suggest that the EU's fines against US companies, such as Apple's $15 billion fine, amount to a tax on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple by reducing regulatory pressure from the US side, as Trump openly defended US tech companies against EU antitrust matters. However, the EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies, and Apple's stock price has been impacted by these regulatory actions in the past. Given the mixed implications and the ongoing nature of these regulatory battles, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile store to include third-party games and temporarily covering core technology fees for developers participating in its free-games program in Europe could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue. However, Apple's business is diversified, and the App Store is just one aspect of its revenue streams. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mixed sentiment regarding the impact of this news on Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the increased competition, while others predict a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Taking into account the potential negative impact of increased competition and the mitigating factors of Apple's diversified business and strong brand, I estimate the probability of a stock price rise to be slightly lower than the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline. Moreover, previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall. The mix of negative sentiment from a reliable source like Cramer and the broader market concerns about innovation and demand could amplify the downward pressure.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which could lead to reduced revenue from app sales.

While some models highlighted Apple's AI strategy and Warren Buffett's investment, the overall sentiment leans towards caution. Given the mixed signals and the prevailing negative trend, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article attempts to downplay the innovation concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's significant investment in AI-related stocks, with Apple being a major holding (22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio).  While Berkshire Hathaway previously reduced its Apple stake, the substantial remaining investment signals continued confidence. Apple's AI initiatives, including Apple Intelligence, are presented positively. However, the news is not solely about Apple; it's a broader piece about Buffett's AI investments, diluting the impact on Apple's stock price.  The positive sentiment towards Apple's AI strategy and Buffett's continued investment suggest a higher probability of a price rise.  However, the diluted nature of the news and the previous reduction in Berkshire's Apple holdings temper the expected impact.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, lacking a clear consensus.  Considering the positive aspect of Buffett's continued large investment and the generally positive outlook on Apple's AI strategy, I'm assigning a moderate probability to a price rise, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based solely on this news. The previous predictions show a trend towards a slightly negative sentiment, which I've considered in my assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.
