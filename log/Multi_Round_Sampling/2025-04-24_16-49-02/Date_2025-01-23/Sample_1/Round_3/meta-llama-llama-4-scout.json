(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump opens a divide between US and EU over Big Tech\nNews Content: President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. If consumers prefer Epic's platform, it could lead to reduced revenue for Apple from its App Store. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a potential for a negative impact, it may not be significant enough to cause a drastic decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed message. While it acknowledges a potential lack of innovation at Apple, as suggested by Mark Zuckerberg, it also argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This suggests that the company's current performance and market position are strong enough to withstand concerns about innovation. The 'shouldn't matter to investors' part is crucial. It implies that the author believes Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem are sufficient to maintain its value. Therefore, the negative sentiment regarding innovation is somewhat mitigated. However, any negative press, even if qualified, can introduce uncertainty. I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a rise because the article argues that the lack of innovation shouldn't matter to investors, suggesting underlying strength. However, the initial negative statement from Zuckerberg and the acknowledgement of a potential innovation issue prevent a strong positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant investment in Apple (AAPL), representing 22.7% of its portfolio.  While the article mentions Berkshire Hathaway selling off a portion of its Apple holdings previously, the continued substantial investment and Apple's strategic moves into AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence software and leveraging AI across its hardware and software, are presented positively.  The article emphasizes the potential for Apple to become a major player in the consumer AI market given its large user base.  However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it discusses Buffett's AI investments across multiple companies.  Therefore, the positive impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely to be somewhat diluted.  The overall positive sentiment towards Apple's AI strategy, coupled with Buffett's continued significant investment, suggests a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate, not dramatic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other smartphone makers are facing regulatory pressure from India to open up their app stores. Regulatory pressures, especially in a significant market like India, can lead to increased operational costs, potential loss of control over proprietary ecosystems, and reduced profitability. Historically, such news tends to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential decline in stock price. However, the exact impact depends on the company's ability to negotiate or adapt to regulatory changes. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile store to include third-party games, which could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue. Additionally, Epic Games' decision to temporarily cover core technology fees for developers participating in its free-games program in Europe may attract more developers to its platform, further threatening Apple's App Store dominance. This increased competition could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the impact may be limited as Apple's business is diversified and the App Store is just one aspect of its revenue streams.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which could lead to reduced revenue from app sales. This concern is echoed in previous predictions that highlight the potential negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased competition. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, diverse product offerings, and existing market position may mitigate the overall impact. Given the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the competitive threat, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline presents a nuanced view. While it acknowledges Zuckerberg's criticism of Apple's innovation, it also suggests this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This implies underlying strength in Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem. However, the initial negative sentiment from Zuckerberg and the acknowledgement of a potential innovation issue prevent a strong positive outlook. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on competitive threats and regulatory pressures, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall. Others highlighted Apple's AI strategy and Warren Buffett's investment, suggesting a potential rise. Given the conflicting signals and the headline's attempt to downplay the innovation concerns, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The previous rounds show a trend towards negative sentiment, so I will adjust my prediction accordingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Warren Buffett's investment in AI-focused companies, with Apple being a significant holding (22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio). While Berkshire Hathaway previously reduced its Apple stake, the substantial remaining investment signals continued confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.  Apple's strategic moves into AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence, are highlighted as positive factors. However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it's a broader piece about Buffett's AI investments.  The positive sentiment towards Apple's AI strategy and Buffett's continued significant investment suggest a higher probability of a price rise.  However, the diluted nature of the news (covering multiple companies) and the previous reduction in Berkshire's Apple holdings temper the expected impact.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions and lack a clear consensus, I'm assigning a moderate probability to a price rise, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is facing regulatory pressure from India to open up its app stores, which could lead to increased operational costs and reduced control over its ecosystem. This kind of regulatory scrutiny typically heightens investor concerns and can negatively impact stock prices in the short term. While Apple's diversified business model might mitigate some of the negative effects, the immediate market reaction is likely to be cautious due to the potential for reduced profitability and increased competition. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting the general sentiment that regulatory pressures are a significant downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news discusses the ongoing tensions between the US and EU over antitrust battles with Big Tech companies, including Apple. President Trump's comments suggest that the EU's fines against US companies, such as Apple's $15 billion fine, amount to a tax on American corporations. This could potentially benefit Apple by reducing regulatory pressure from the US side, as Trump openly defended US tech companies against EU antitrust matters. However, the EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies, and Apple's stock price has been impacted by these regulatory actions in the past. Given the mixed implications and the ongoing nature of these regulatory battles, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with a cautious outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games expanding its mobile store to include third-party games and temporarily covering core technology fees for developers participating in its free-games program in Europe could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue. However, Apple's business is diversified, and the App Store is just one aspect of its revenue streams. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a mixed sentiment regarding the impact of this news on Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the increased competition, while others predict a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Taking into account the potential negative impact of increased competition and the mitigating factors of Apple's diversified business and strong brand, I estimate the probability of a stock price rise to be slightly lower than the probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline. Moreover, previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall. The mix of negative sentiment from a reliable source like Cramer and the broader market concerns about innovation and demand could amplify the downward pressure.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace poses a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, which could lead to reduced revenue from app sales.

While Berkshire Hathaway previously reduced its Apple stake, the substantial remaining investment signals continued confidence. Apple's AI initiatives, including Apple Intelligence, are presented positively. However, the news is not solely about Apple; it's a broader piece about Buffett's AI investments, diluting the impact on Apple's stock price.

However, the diluted nature of the news and the previous reduction in Berkshire's Apple holdings temper the expected impact.

Considering the positive aspect of Buffett's continued large investment and the generally positive outlook on Apple's AI strategy, I'm assigning a moderate probability to a price rise, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based solely on this news.
