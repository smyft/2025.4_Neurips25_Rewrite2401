(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games kicks off plan to add third-party games to own mobile store\nNews Content: (Reuters) - \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games said on Thursday it will add 19 third-party games to its own marketplace app on Google's Android globally and 16 games on Apple's iOS in the European Union.\n\nThe videogame company had launched its mobile game store in 2024, allowing it to avoid fees imposed by conventional app marketplaces such as Google's Play and Apple's App Store while making in-app purchases.\n\nEpic Games had also argued that users did not have much choice beyond the two popular app stores for downloading gaming applications, suppressing competition.\n\nIt will launch a program to offer free games on its mobile store, starting with titles such as \"Bloons TD 6\" and \"Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee\".\n\nThe company said it would temporarily cover core technology fees, the 0.50 euros ($0.5210) charged by Apple on every app after it crosses 1 million installs, for developers that participate in Epic's free-games program in Europe.\n\n\"We are opening up the Epic Games Store to mobile games from third parties, starting with a small catalog and expanding over time to a very big catalog,\" CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters.\n\n\"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores and different places, but to build a single cross-platform store.\"\n\nNorth Carolina-based Epic Games reached 29 million users for its mobile store by end-2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users.\n\nThe company also offers a computer graphics software, called \"Unreal Engine\", which is widely used by app developers to design and develop games.\n\nApple had approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe last year. Epic had faced off with Google and Apple over their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on app store payments.\n\nAfter getting banned for nearly four years, Epic's \"Fortnite\" returned on iPhones in the European Union and Android devices globally.\n\n($1 = 0.9598 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Epic Games introducing third-party games to its mobile marketplace could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple, particularly in the gaming sector. If consumers prefer Epic's platform, it could lead to reduced revenue for Apple from its App Store. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by its strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a potential for a negative impact, it may not be significant enough to cause a drastic decline in stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed message. While it acknowledges a potential lack of innovation at Apple, as suggested by Mark Zuckerberg, it also argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This suggests that the company's current performance and market position are strong enough to withstand concerns about innovation. The 'shouldn't matter to investors' part is crucial. It implies that the author believes Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem are sufficient to maintain its value. Therefore, the negative sentiment regarding innovation is somewhat mitigated. However, any negative press, even if qualified, can introduce uncertainty. I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a rise because the article argues that the lack of innovation shouldn't matter to investors, suggesting underlying strength. However, the initial negative statement from Zuckerberg and the acknowledgement of a potential innovation issue prevent a strong positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news highlights that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has a significant investment in Apple (AAPL), representing 22.7% of its portfolio.  While the article mentions Berkshire Hathaway selling off a portion of its Apple holdings previously, the continued substantial investment and Apple's strategic moves into AI, including the launch of Apple Intelligence software and leveraging AI across its hardware and software, are presented positively.  The article emphasizes the potential for Apple to become a major player in the consumer AI market given its large user base.  However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it discusses Buffett's AI investments across multiple companies.  Therefore, the positive impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely to be somewhat diluted.  The overall positive sentiment towards Apple's AI strategy, coupled with Buffett's continued significant investment, suggests a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the effect is likely to be moderate, not dramatic.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) and other smartphone makers are facing regulatory pressure from India to open up their app stores. Regulatory pressures, especially in a significant market like India, can lead to increased operational costs, potential loss of control over proprietary ecosystems, and reduced profitability. Historically, such news tends to negatively impact investor sentiment, leading to a potential decline in stock price. However, the exact impact depends on the company's ability to negotiate or adapt to regulatory changes. Given the uncertainty and potential negative implications, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Epic Games is expanding its mobile store to include third-party games, which could potentially reduce Apple's App Store revenue. Additionally, Epic Games' decision to temporarily cover core technology fees for developers participating in its free-games program in Europe may attract more developers to its platform, further threatening Apple's App Store dominance. This increased competition could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the impact may be limited as Apple's business is diversified and the App Store is just one aspect of its revenue streams.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Jim Cramer predicts Apple Inc. (AAPL) will miss earnings expectations. Cramer emphasizes concerns regarding AI innovation not working and a significant drop in orders from China. These factors point towards a negative outlook for the company's performance, potentially leading to a stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
