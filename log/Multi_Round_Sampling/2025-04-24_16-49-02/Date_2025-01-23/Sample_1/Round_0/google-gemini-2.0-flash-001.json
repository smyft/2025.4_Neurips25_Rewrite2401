While it acknowledges a potential lack of innovation at Apple, as suggested by Mark Zuckerberg, it also argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This suggests that the company's current performance and market position are strong enough to withstand concerns about innovation. The 'shouldn't matter to investors' part is crucial. It implies that the author believes Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem are sufficient to maintain its value. Therefore, the negative sentiment regarding innovation is somewhat mitigated. However, any negative press, even if qualified, can introduce uncertainty. I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a rise because the article argues that the lack of innovation shouldn't matter to investors, suggesting underlying strength. However, the initial negative statement from Zuckerberg and the acknowledgement of a potential innovation issue prevent a strong positive outlook.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Mark Zuckerberg May Be Right About Apple's Lack of Innovation.
