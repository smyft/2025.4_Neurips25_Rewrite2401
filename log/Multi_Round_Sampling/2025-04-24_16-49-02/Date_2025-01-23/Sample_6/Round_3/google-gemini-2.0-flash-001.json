(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors\nNews Content: Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025.

The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The headline suggests a positive outlook on the stock market, specifically mentioning a 'bull market' which typically indicates rising stock prices. This could lead to increased investor confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL), potentially driving the stock price up. However, without specific details about Apple's performance or market conditions, the probabilities are estimated conservatively. The overall sentiment appears bullish, leading to a higher probability of price increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed bag of potential impacts on Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump could help Apple avoid tariffs, which would be positive. Relaxed antitrust regulations could also benefit Apple, potentially opening doors for mergers and acquisitions. However, uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act and its potential impact on the semiconductor industry, a critical component of Apple's products, introduces a negative element. The article also highlights the importance of AI revenue and spending, and while Apple is expected to discuss these topics, the market's reaction is uncertain, as seen with Microsoft and Meta's recent earnings disappointments despite strong AI narratives. The potential impact of Trump's stance on TikTok is less directly relevant to Apple compared to Meta and Google. Considering these factors, the potential for positive outcomes (tariff avoidance, relaxed regulations) is balanced by the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act and the market's reaction to AI-related announcements. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents conflicting perspectives on Apple's future.  Jefferies downgrades Apple due to weak iPhone sales expectations and concerns about the AI strategy rollout.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, highlighting manageable China unit declines, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The disagreement between these reputable firms suggests significant uncertainty. While the short-term outlook appears bearish due to immediate sales concerns, the long-term potential of AI integration and the Wedbush's bullish price target of $325 (significantly higher than the current price) suggest a higher probability of a rise in the long term.  The current market reaction is mixed, with a slight increase after the initial drop.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term bullish sentiment, but acknowledge the significant short-term risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, this should not concern investors. This implies that Apple's current business model and financial performance are strong enough to sustain investor confidence despite criticisms about innovation. Historically, Apple has demonstrated resilience and strong market performance even during periods of perceived innovation lulls. Therefore, the impact of this news on the stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive, as it reassures investors that innovation is not the sole driver of Apple's success.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of the new administration, particularly President Trump, on Big Tech companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL). Key points include potential tariffs on goods from China, antitrust regulations, and the CHIPS Act. Trump's relationship with tech CEOs, like Tim Cook of Apple, might influence company-specific outcomes. Additionally, AI revenue and spending will be a focus, with companies like Microsoft and Meta already seeing significant investments in AI. For Apple, avoiding tariffs and navigating the new administration's policies on AI and semiconductors could positively impact its stock price. However, uncertainty around Trump's policies and their implementation could lead to volatility.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Indian government's request for Apple and Google to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores. While this could potentially increase Apple's presence in the Indian market, the company's reluctance to cooperate and the possibility of legal actions or policy directives may create uncertainty and negatively impact the stock price. Additionally, the comparison to Apple's similar action in Russia in 2021 may suggest that the company is willing to comply with local regulations, but the current situation in India may be more complex. Overall, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news describes Perplexity launching a new AI assistant for Android as competition to existing services like Siri and Alexa. This might not directly impact Apple Inc.'s stock price since it is more about competitive dynamics within the AI assistant market. However, there's a slight positive sentiment as it indicates ongoing innovation and potential for partnerships or improvements in Apple's own AI offerings.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The headline suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of a bull market, which typically indicates rising stock prices. This aligns with the previous predictions that reflect a generally bullish outlook despite some mixed signals regarding Apple's performance and market conditions. The overall sentiment from the news appears optimistic, which could lead to increased investor confidence. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's performance and potential risks from external factors, such as regulatory changes or competition, necessitates a cautious approach. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging some risk of a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On the positive side, Tim Cook's relationship with President Trump could help Apple avoid tariffs, and relaxed antitrust regulations could benefit the company. The focus on AI revenue and spending is also relevant, although the market's reaction is uncertain. However, the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act and its potential impact on the semiconductor industry, a critical component of Apple's products, introduces a negative element. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some leaning positive and others negative. Given the mixed signals and the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise, but acknowledging the significant risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While short-term concerns exist regarding weaker iPhone sales and a perceived late entry into the AI market, several factors suggest a more nuanced picture. Wedbush's bullish outlook and $325 price target (significantly above the current price) counterbalance the bearish sentiment from Jefferies.  The potential for a significant AI partnership in China and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence are positive factors.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price rise. Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy's immediate impact, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term potential highlighted by Wedbush, but acknowledging the short-term headwinds. The current market reaction (a slight increase) also supports a slightly more optimistic outlook. However, the uncertainty warrants a probability that is not overly confident in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, investors should not be overly concerned. This implies that Apple's financial performance and market position remain strong despite criticisms. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a higher probability of a rise due to Apple's resilience and strong market performance, while others highlight short-term risks and uncertainties. Given Apple's historical ability to maintain investor confidence even during innovation lulls, the impact of this news is likely neutral to slightly positive.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of the new administration, particularly President Trump, on Big Tech companies including Apple Inc.

However, uncertainty around Trump's policies and their implementation could lead to volatility. Considering these factors, the potential for positive outcomes (tariff avoidance, relaxed regulations) is balanced by the uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act and the market's reaction to AI-related announcements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the Indian government's request for Apple and Google to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores. While this could potentially increase Apple's presence in the Indian market, the company's reluctance to cooperate and the possibility of legal actions or policy directives may create uncertainty. However, considering the previous predictions and the overall trend, it seems that the market is not heavily impacted by this news. The predictions from other models show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but most of them lean towards a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price. Given this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the launch of a new AI assistant by Perplexity, which aims to compete with Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT. Although this news indicates increased competition in the AI assistant market, it does not directly imply a negative or positive impact on Apple's stock price. The news also mentions Apple's efforts in integrating AI technologies into its platforms such as Siri. Given the previous predictions, there is a mix of bullish and bearish sentiments. The latest predictions suggest more neutral to slightly negative probabilities, possibly due to uncertainties in AI-related developments and competition. Taking all this into account, the estimated impact on Apple's stock price is moderately neutral.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The headline suggests a positive sentiment towards Apple Inc. in the context of a bull market, which typically indicates rising stock prices. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most leaning towards a slight increase in stock price due to factors like potential tariff avoidance and a generally optimistic outlook despite some mixed signals regarding Apple's performance. The overall sentiment appears bullish, which could lead to increased investor confidence. However, there are still risks and uncertainties that could impact the stock negatively. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, while acknowledging the potential for a decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on two main factors: the upcoming earnings season for Big Tech and the potential impact of a new Trump administration. For Apple, the key considerations are: 1) Trump's potential policies on tariffs (especially with China), antitrust regulations, and the CHIPS Act; 2) Apple's AI revenue and spending; and 3) Tim Cook's relationship with Trump, which could help Apple navigate potential trade conflicts. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, with a slight tendency towards a positive outlook. Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and the importance of AI for Apple's future growth, I believe the market reaction will be cautiously optimistic. The potential for tariff avoidance and relaxed regulations is a positive, but the CHIPS Act and AI spending remain wildcards. Considering the previous predictions and the current news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the significant risks.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Short-term concerns exist regarding weaker iPhone sales and a perceived late entry into the AI market, as highlighted by Jefferies' downgrade. However, Wedbush maintains a strong positive outlook, citing manageable China declines, potential for a major AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  Their $325 price target is significantly higher than the current price. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, generally leaning slightly towards a price rise, but with significant uncertainty.  Considering the conflicting analyst opinions and the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy's immediate impact, I'm assigning a moderate probability to a price rise, reflecting the long-term potential highlighted by Wedbush, but acknowledging the short-term headwinds. The slight increase in share price after the initial drop also supports a slightly more optimistic outlook.  The overall uncertainty, however, prevents a strongly bullish prediction.  The consistent slight leaning towards a rise in previous rounds also informs my prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline suggests that while Apple may lack innovation, this should not concern investors, implying that Apple's current business model and financial performance are strong enough to sustain investor confidence. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of a rise due to Apple's resilience and strong market performance, while others highlight short-term risks and uncertainties. Given Apple's historical ability to maintain investor confidence even during innovation lulls, the impact of this news is likely neutral to slightly positive. The overall sentiment from the news and previous predictions suggests a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with some caution due to potential short-term risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the impact of President Trump's policies on Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc.

The predictions from other models show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, but most of them lean towards a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price. Given this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling. The fact that Apple has previously complied with similar requests in other countries, such as Russia, suggests that the company may eventually cooperate with the Indian government, which could lead to a positive outcome. However, the uncertainty surrounding the situation and the potential for legal actions or policy directives warrants a cautious approach.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the launch of a new AI assistant by Perplexity, which aims to compete with Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT. This competition could introduce some level of uncertainty in the market regarding Apple's AI strategy and market share. However, the news does not provide any direct indication of negative implications for Apple's core business operations or financial health. Previous predictions suggest a mix of sentiments, with some leaning towards a bullish outlook due to long-term potential and others towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook due to short-term uncertainties and competition. Given the mixed signals and lack of specific negative news about Apple's performance, the probability of a moderate rise in stock price is slightly higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
