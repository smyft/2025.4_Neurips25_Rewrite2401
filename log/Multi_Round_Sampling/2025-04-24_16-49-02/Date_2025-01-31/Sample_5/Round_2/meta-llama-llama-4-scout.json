A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock is trading higher in premarket following a strong quarterly profit and sales report that exceeded estimates. The net income and sales growth indicate positive performance, particularly in the services division. However, concerns about the rollout of AI features and declining revenue from China may temper investor enthusiasm. Overall, the strong quarterly results suggest a higher probability of stock price rise, but the cautious outlook and competitive pressures introduce some risk, leading to a balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates negative pressure on the Dow Jones due to Trump's tariff order. It also mentions Apple breaking key levels, which usually implies a downward trend. The inflation data (PCE index rising) could be interpreted negatively as it might lead to the Fed maintaining higher interest rates for longer, which is generally unfavorable for growth stocks like Apple. While the article mentions MicroStrategy's move, its direct impact on Apple is unclear and likely minimal. Considering these factors, the negative aspects seem to outweigh any potential positives.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings report showed mixed results. While EPS and revenue slightly beat expectations, iPhone sales missed estimates and sales in Greater China were significantly down. However, the positive outlook for Q2 sales growth, driven by the rollout of Apple Intelligence features, is a key factor.  The cautious approach to AI also seems to have insulated Apple from recent Big Tech market turmoil.  The overall picture suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook. While the weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and China performance are negative, the positive Q2 guidance and the success of Apple Intelligence outweigh these concerns in the short term. The market's positive pre-market reaction further supports this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s integration of AI into its devices, specifically through the launch of Apple Intelligence, which emphasizes personal privacy. This aligns with the broader trend of AI driving growth in the tech sector, as evidenced by the significant market gains in AI-linked stocks. However, the immediate financial impact of AI on Apple's revenue appears limited, as the iPhone 16 series did not see a significant sales boost despite AI features. The overall positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strong financial performance (record revenue of $94.9 billion) suggests a likely positive market reaction, though the lack of immediate AI-driven sales growth may temper enthusiasm. The broader context of AI's transformative potential and Apple's positioning as a leader in consumer electronics with a focus on privacy supports a moderate probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks are mixed, which suggests that there is no strong positive or negative trend in the tech sector. Since the news does not provide any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL), it is difficult to determine the impact on the company's stock price. However, given that the sector is mixed, it is likely that the stock price will not be significantly affected. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is estimated to be around 50% each.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that despite a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, Apple's stock may not see sustained gains as AI isn't currently driving significant upgrades for iPhones. This indicates a potential short-term positive reaction followed by a more cautious long-term outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's stock is experiencing a positive premarket reaction due to a quarterly profit and sales report that exceeded estimates, with net income and sales growth indicating strong performance. However, concerns about the rollout of AI features and declining revenue from China may temper investor enthusiasm. The mixed outlook on AI and the competitive landscape suggest that while there is a strong basis for optimism, caution is warranted. Overall, the strong quarterly results and positive analyst commentary support a higher probability of stock price rise, but the challenges in AI adoption and market competition introduce some risk.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline presents a mixed picture for Apple. The Dow Jones is diving due to Trump's tariff order, which is generally negative for the market and could indirectly affect Apple. The mention of Apple breaking key levels suggests a potential downward trend. However, the PCE inflation data, while showing an increase, might not be directly impactful on Apple's stock in the short term. Considering the negative sentiment surrounding the Dow and the technical indicator of breaking key levels, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher. The previous rounds of predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models focusing on Apple's AI initiatives and earnings, while others emphasize the broader market conditions. Given the conflicting signals, I'm leaning slightly towards a negative outlook due to the immediate negative pressure on the Dow and the technical signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 earnings were mixed. While revenue and EPS slightly beat expectations, iPhone sales missed targets, and Greater China sales were significantly down.  However, the positive Q2 sales guidance, driven by the rollout of Apple Intelligence, is a key bullish factor.  The cautious AI approach insulated Apple from recent Big Tech market turmoil.  The pre-market rise suggests positive market sentiment.  While the weaker iPhone sales and China performance are negative, the positive Q2 guidance and Apple Intelligence's success outweigh these concerns in the short term.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely, and the mixed nature of the results, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for negative impacts from China and iPhone sales to materialize later.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strategic move to integrate AI into its devices with a focus on personal privacy, which aligns with the broader positive trend in the tech sector driven by AI advancements. Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, a 6% increase from the previous year, underscores its strong financial performance. However, the immediate financial impact of AI features on iPhone sales appears limited, as the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant boost. This mixed signal\u2014strong financials and AI integration versus muted immediate AI-driven sales growth\u2014suggests a balanced outlook. Additionally, the broader context of AI's transformative potential and Apple's leadership in consumer electronics supports a moderate probability of a stock price rise, while the lack of immediate AI-driven sales growth may temper enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline 'Sector Update: Tech Stocks Mixed in Late Afternoon' does not provide any specific positive or negative information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, considering the mixed trend in the tech sector, it is likely that the stock price will not be significantly affected. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising due to strong quarterly results and the potential of AI features, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about the rollout of AI features, declining revenue from China, and negative pressure on the Dow Jones. Given the lack of specific information about Apple in the news and the mixed opinions from previous predictions, a balanced probability assessment is appropriate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that despite a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, Apple's stock may not see sustained gains as AI isn't currently driving significant upgrades for iPhones. Most previous predictions show a mixed outlook with some models suggesting a slight rise due to positive sentiment around AI and recent earnings, while others highlight the lack of immediate AI-driven sales growth and competitive pressures. Given the current news and the mix of sentiments from previous predictions, it is reasonable to assign a moderate probability of stock price stability.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
