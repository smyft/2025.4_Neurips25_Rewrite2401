      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trending tickers: Apple, Intel, Novartis, Shell, Smiths Group\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL)\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday, following a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates.\n\nNet income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago. Meanwhile services revenue was up 14%, with revenue from China down 11%.\n\n\"Overall another very strong quarter,\" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Tipranks. \"It was the first quarterly numbers since the rollout of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s suite of AI features. Apple (AAPL) expects growth in the March quarter of \u201clow to mid-single digits\u201d and \u201clow double digits\u201d growth for its Services division\".\n\nFor the year-to-date Apple (AAPL) stock is 2.6% lower, knocked amid a wider tech rout related to worries around Chinese AI challenger DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of AI services on iPhone 16 hasn\u2019t exactly gone smoothly. Having been late to the AI party in the first place, Apple (AAPL) still hasn\u2019t rolled out AI services in any non-English language,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n\"This cautious pace seems odd when you consider AI has exploded onto the scene and consumers increasingly have a lot of choice for AI-enabled devices. It\u2019s like a carrot dangled in front of Apple (AAPL) and it only wants to nibble at it, rather than devour the whole thing.\"\n\n\u201cConsumers need a reason to upgrade their phone, otherwise they\u2019re going to stick with their current model given how even the cheapest devices are fairly sophisticated these days. Apple (AAPL) is clearly hoping its AI services will be the catalyst to drive handset upgrades, but it\u2019s going about it in a strange way.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel (INTC) stock gained 1.3% on Thursday and was trading 1.7% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly earnings report which beat fourth quarter expectations, but gave a tepid read for the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe CPU and chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, above the analyst estimate of $0.12.\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $14.3bn, beating consensus estimates of $13.8bn but declining 7% year-on-year. For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates. The increase comes off the back of sales of its heart failure drug, Entresto, and multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEntrestro, which will lose its patent protection later this year, saw quarterly revenues jump by a third to $2.2bn.\n\nFor Q4, net income rose 26% to $3.9bn. This surpassed analyst consensus of $3.6bn, Reuters reported.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nOil major Shell (SHEL.L) was trading 0.8% higher in the morning on Friday, building on gains from the week following its quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe company reported a sharp fall in profits in the fourth quarter but declared another $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) share buyback.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $3.66bn in the fourth quarter were down 39% on the $6bn Shell (SHEL.L) posted in the third quarter, according to its latest results. For the year, adjusted earnings were down 16% to $23.7bn, compared to $28.3bn in 2023.\n\nShell said income attributable to shareholders had fallen 78% to $928m in the fourth quarter, down from $4.2bn in previous quarter.\n\nHowever, this figure was higher than the $474m it reported in the same period last year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L) was the top riser in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Friday, up more than 14% after the opening bell following news it had responded to activist investor calls to split up its business. The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure. Next steps will be closely watched, with Engine also floating the possibility of a US listing for its John Crane energy services arm which Engine describes as its jewel in the crown.\u201d\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SMIN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock is trading higher in premarket following a strong quarterly report that exceeded profit and sales estimates. The increase in net income and services revenue indicates positive performance. However, concerns about the rollout of AI features and declining revenue from China may temper enthusiasm. Overall, the strong quarterly results suggest a higher probability of stock price rise, but the cautious outlook and competitive pressures introduce some risk, leading to a balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's presence in the AI space with 'Apple Intelligence,' it highlights concerns about the company's innovation pace compared to competitors. The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, is a significant negative signal. The analyst's expectation of slower iPhone growth and Apple's uncertain role in generative AI adoption further contribute to a bearish sentiment. The article also mentions that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe, suggesting that investors might shift their focus away from Apple. While the article mentions Apple being second on their list of AI stocks, the overall tone leans towards caution regarding Apple's AI prospects and its valuation. The negative analyst rating and concerns about AI innovation outweigh the positive mention of Apple Intelligence. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains.  However, the article content is inaccessible, preventing a detailed analysis of specific factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, the prediction relies on the general positive sector trend.  While the sector-wide positive movement suggests a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising, the lack of specific information about Apple makes it impossible to assign a high probability to either outcome. A moderate increase in probability of a price rise is assumed based on the general positive sector news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled its project to develop augmented reality glasses that would pair with Mac devices, marking another setback in its AR/VR efforts. This follows the lukewarm reception of the Apple Vision Pro and previous cancellations like the self-driving car project. The cancellation suggests challenges in innovation and execution, which could negatively impact investor confidence. However, Apple continues to work on other AR/VR projects, including successors to the Vision Pro, and maintains strong revenue from other segments like Wearables and Services. The mixed signals (negative due to project cancellation but positive due to ongoing innovation and strong core business) suggest a moderate negative impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in innovating in AI, citing a recent downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle and little upside to Apple's valuation. This negative sentiment and lack of confidence in Apple's AI capabilities are likely to impact the stock price negatively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has developed competitive AI models at a lower cost than Big Tech companies. The CEOs of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have taken an optimistic tone, suggesting that DeepSeek's innovations could benefit the industry and drive efficiency. However, the article also mentions that Apple's revenue in China was down 11% year over year, which could be a concern for the company. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to positive for Apple, as the company's stock avoided the initial sell-off and the CEO's comments were optimistic.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that despite a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, Apple's stock may not see sustained gains as AI isn't currently driving significant upgrades for iPhones. This indicates a potential short-term positive reaction followed by a more cautious long-term outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's stock is experiencing a positive premarket reaction due to a quarterly report that exceeded profit and sales estimates, with net income and services revenue showing growth. However, concerns about the rollout of AI features, declining revenue from China, and a cautious outlook for future growth temper the overall sentiment. While the strong quarterly results suggest a higher probability of stock price rise, the mixed signals regarding innovation and competition lead to a more balanced assessment. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but with significant risks that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's perceived struggles in AI innovation, particularly compared to other companies. The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in China, is a significant negative signal. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform due to slower iPhone growth and Apple's uncertain role in generative AI adoption. The article also highlights that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, but the negative aspects related to AI innovation and analyst downgrades seem to outweigh the positives. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight shift towards a more negative outlook. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline is positive for the tech sector as a whole, but the article content is unavailable.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting a lack of consensus on Apple's near-term prospects. Some models highlight positive factors like strong quarterly reports and general sector gains, while others emphasize concerns about AI innovation, iPhone sales, and the Chinese market. The absence of detailed information in the news article makes it difficult to weigh these conflicting factors.  Considering the range of previous predictions and the limited information, a neutral stance is adopted. The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, reflecting the positive sector trend, but the uncertainty remains significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled its project to develop augmented reality glasses, which is a setback in its AR/VR efforts.

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI' and the content suggest that Apple is facing challenges in AI innovation, which could negatively impact its stock price. Oppenheimer downgraded Apple's stock due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment. However, Apple's strong quarterly results and presence in the AI space with 'Apple Intelligence' provide some positive aspects. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has developed competitive AI models at a lower cost than Big Tech companies.

Taking into account the overall tone of the article and the previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that despite a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, Apple's stock may not see sustained gains as AI isn't currently driving significant upgrades for iPhones. This aligns with a mixed outlook where the initial boost from AI-related news is likely to be short-lived. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a rise due to sector trends and others predicting a fall due to concerns about AI innovation and revenue challenges. Considering the current news and weighing it against the historical sentiments, the overall sentiment leans towards a cautious outlook with a slight negative bias.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's stock is experiencing a positive premarket reaction due to a quarterly report that exceeded profit and sales estimates, with net income and services revenue showing growth.

Some models emphasize positive factors like strong quarterly reports and sector gains, while others highlight concerns about AI innovation, iPhone sales, and the Chinese market.  The lack of specific information in the accessible news makes it difficult to definitively weigh these conflicting factors.  However, the preponderance of negative predictions in previous rounds, particularly those citing concerns about AI innovation and weakening iPhone sales, suggests a bearish bias.  While the general tech sector strength offers some support for a price rise, the more specific concerns about Apple outweigh this general positive trend.  Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price fall, reflecting the overall negative sentiment from previous analyses and the lack of positive, specific news about Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. canceling its project to develop augmented reality glasses (N107) is a significant setback in its AR/VR efforts, following the lukewarm reception of the Apple Vision Pro and previous project cancellations like the self-driving car. This cancellation signals challenges in innovation and execution, which could negatively impact investor confidence. However, Apple continues to work on other AR/VR projects, including successors to the Vision Pro, and maintains strong revenue from other segments like Wearables and Services.

This implies that there might be skepticism around Apple's ability to innovate rapidly in AI, which has been a key area of focus for many tech companies. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with several models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about AI innovation, iPhone sales, and revenue challenges in China. The current news corroborates some of these concerns, especially regarding AI's impact on product upgrades. While there are some positive factors like Apple's strong quarterly results, the overall sentiment leans towards caution and a potential negative impact on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
