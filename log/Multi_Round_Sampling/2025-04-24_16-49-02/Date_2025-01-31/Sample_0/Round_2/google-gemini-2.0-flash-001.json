(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple's stock is trading higher in premarket following a strong quarterly report that exceeded profit and sales estimates. The increase in net income and services revenue indicates positive performance. However, concerns about the rollout of AI features and declining revenue from China may temper enthusiasm. Overall, the strong quarterly results suggest a higher probability of stock price rise, but the cautious outlook and competitive pressures introduce some risk, leading to a balanced probability assessment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's presence in the AI space with 'Apple Intelligence,' it highlights concerns about the company's innovation pace compared to competitors. The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, is a significant negative signal. The analyst's expectation of slower iPhone growth and Apple's uncertain role in generative AI adoption further contribute to a bearish sentiment. The article also mentions that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe, suggesting that investors might shift their focus away from Apple. While the article mentions Apple being second on their list of AI stocks, the overall tone leans towards caution regarding Apple's AI prospects and its valuation. The negative analyst rating and concerns about AI innovation outweigh the positive mention of Apple Intelligence. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend in the tech sector, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) showing gains.  However, the article content is inaccessible, preventing a detailed analysis of specific factors affecting Apple.  Therefore, the prediction relies on the general positive sector trend.  While the sector-wide positive movement suggests a higher likelihood of Apple's stock price rising, the lack of specific information about Apple makes it impossible to assign a high probability to either outcome. A moderate increase in probability of a price rise is assumed based on the general positive sector news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled its project to develop augmented reality glasses that would pair with Mac devices, marking another setback in its AR/VR efforts. This follows the lukewarm reception of the Apple Vision Pro and previous cancellations like the self-driving car project. The cancellation suggests challenges in innovation and execution, which could negatively impact investor confidence. However, Apple continues to work on other AR/VR projects, including successors to the Vision Pro, and maintains strong revenue from other segments like Wearables and Services. The mixed signals (negative due to project cancellation but positive due to ongoing innovation and strong core business) suggest a moderate negative impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's struggles in innovating in AI, citing a recent downgrade by Oppenheimer from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle and little upside to Apple's valuation. This negative sentiment and lack of confidence in Apple's AI capabilities are likely to impact the stock price negatively.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has developed competitive AI models at a lower cost than Big Tech companies. The CEOs of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have taken an optimistic tone, suggesting that DeepSeek's innovations could benefit the industry and drive efficiency. However, the article also mentions that Apple's revenue in China was down 11% year over year, which could be a concern for the company. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to positive for Apple, as the company's stock avoided the initial sell-off and the CEO's comments were optimistic.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news suggests that despite a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, Apple's stock may not see sustained gains as AI isn't currently driving significant upgrades for iPhones. This indicates a potential short-term positive reaction followed by a more cautious long-term outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Apple's stock is experiencing a positive premarket reaction due to a quarterly report that exceeded profit and sales estimates, with net income and services revenue showing growth. However, concerns about the rollout of AI features, declining revenue from China, and a cautious outlook for future growth temper the overall sentiment. While the strong quarterly results suggest a higher probability of stock price rise, the mixed signals regarding innovation and competition lead to a more balanced assessment. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but with significant risks that could lead to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's perceived struggles in AI innovation, particularly compared to other companies. The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in China, is a significant negative signal. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform due to slower iPhone growth and Apple's uncertain role in generative AI adoption. The article also highlights that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, but the negative aspects related to AI innovation and analyst downgrades seem to outweigh the positives. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight shift towards a more negative outlook. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline is positive for the tech sector as a whole, but the article content is unavailable.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting a lack of consensus on Apple's near-term prospects. Some models highlight positive factors like strong quarterly reports and general sector gains, while others emphasize concerns about AI innovation, iPhone sales, and the Chinese market. The absence of detailed information in the news article makes it difficult to weigh these conflicting factors.  Considering the range of previous predictions and the limited information, a neutral stance is adopted. The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, reflecting the positive sector trend, but the uncertainty remains significant.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. has canceled its project to develop augmented reality glasses, which is a setback in its AR/VR efforts. This follows the lukewarm reception of the Apple Vision Pro and previous cancellations like the self-driving car project. The cancellation suggests challenges in innovation and execution, which could negatively impact investor confidence. However, Apple continues to work on other AR/VR projects, including successors to the Vision Pro, and maintains strong revenue from other segments like Wearables and Services. The mixed signals (negative due to project cancellation but positive due to ongoing innovation and strong core business) suggest a moderate negative impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a negative outlook, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI' and the content suggest that Apple is facing challenges in AI innovation, which could negatively impact its stock price. Oppenheimer downgraded Apple's stock due to a weaker outlook for iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors contribute to a bearish sentiment. However, Apple's strong quarterly results and presence in the AI space with 'Apple Intelligence' provide some positive aspects. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup that has developed competitive AI models at a lower cost than Big Tech companies.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive tone from the CEOs and the potential benefits of DeepSeek's innovations, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about Apple's innovation pace and revenue decline in China. Taking into account the overall tone of the article and the previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that despite a temporary boost from the DeepSeek news, Apple's stock may not see sustained gains as AI isn't currently driving significant upgrades for iPhones. This aligns with a mixed outlook where the initial boost from AI-related news is likely to be short-lived. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a rise due to sector trends and others predicting a fall due to concerns about AI innovation and revenue challenges. Considering the current news and weighing it against the historical sentiments, the overall sentiment leans towards a cautious outlook with a slight negative bias.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
