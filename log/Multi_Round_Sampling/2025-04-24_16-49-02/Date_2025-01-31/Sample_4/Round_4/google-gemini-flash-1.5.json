GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction in the premarket with a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following strong quarterly results that exceeded earnings expectations. Although iPhone sales slightly decreased, the company's outlook for future sales growth and strong performance in the services division suggest a positive trend. The cautious approach to AI investments may also be viewed favorably in the current market context. Overall, the combination of better-than-expected earnings, a positive outlook, and strong service revenue supports a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings beat analyst estimates, driven by strong services revenue. Beating estimates is generally a positive signal for investors, suggesting the company is performing well. While the news content mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall positive sentiment from beating estimates, particularly due to the high-margin services sector, is likely to outweigh the negative aspects. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall. However, the 'mixed performance' caveat prevents assigning a very high probability to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple reported record revenue and EPS, exceeding expectations.  While this is overwhelmingly positive, several factors temper the bullish outlook.  The decline in Greater China revenue (attributed partly to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there) is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds a layer of caution.  Foreign exchange headwinds are anticipated to negatively impact the next quarter.  However, the strong performance in other regions, record iPhone upgrader numbers (boosted by Apple Intelligence in some markets), and the robust growth in emerging markets (especially India) suggest continued overall strength.  The record installed base and continued growth in services revenue are also very positive indicators.  Weighing the positives and negatives, a price rise is more likely, but the risks associated with China and currency fluctuations prevent a completely optimistic prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Warren Buffett's investment strategy and its position among his longest-held stocks. While Buffett's continued holding of AAPL is a positive signal, the article also highlights potential challenges, such as reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic headwinds. However, the reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday due to a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates. The company's net income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago, with services revenue up 14%. Despite revenue from China being down 11%, the overall strong quarterly performance and positive outlook for growth in the March quarter are likely to boost investor confidence. However, concerns about the rollout of Apple Intelligence and competition in the AI space may temper enthusiasm. Based on the positive earnings report and growth expectations, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Additionally, services revenue was up 14%. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and the rollout of AI services has been slower than expected. Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction in the premarket with a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following strong quarterly results that exceeded earnings expectations. Although iPhone sales slightly decreased, the company's outlook for future sales growth and strong performance in the services division suggest a positive trend. The cautious approach to AI investments may also be viewed favorably in the current market context. Overall, the combination of better-than-expected earnings, a positive outlook, and strong service revenue supports a higher probability of stock price rise, despite some concerns regarding iPhone sales and market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's Q1 earnings exceeded analyst expectations, primarily driven by strong services revenue. This is generally a positive signal for investors. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall positive sentiment from beating estimates, especially due to the high-margin services sector, is likely to outweigh the negative aspects. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, most models leaned towards a positive outlook, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Given this consensus and the positive earnings report, I will adjust my prediction slightly upwards, but not excessively, to account for the 'mixed performance' caveat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows a mixed bag.  Record revenue and EPS are overwhelmingly positive, exceeding expectations and suggesting strong overall performance.  The significant growth in services revenue (14% YoY) is particularly encouraging, as it represents a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.  Record iPhone upgrader numbers and strong performance in emerging markets (especially India) further bolster the positive outlook.  However, several factors temper the enthusiasm. The 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, partly due to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds caution.  Anticipated foreign exchange headwinds will further impact the next quarter.  The previous predictions range from 0.55 to 0.75 probability of a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment. Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth in services, and the positive outlook in emerging markets, I lean towards a higher probability of a price rise. However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability.  The overall positive sentiment from exceeding expectations and strong service revenue is likely to outweigh the negative aspects in the short term, but the long-term impact of the China market challenges remains uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which is a positive signal given Buffett's reputation as a value investor. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% increase in revenue and strong cash flow, which supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance to these concerns. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which generally leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and the current analysis, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Additionally, services revenue was up 14%. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and the rollout of AI services has been slower than expected. Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. The premarket increase of 3.4% in Apple's stock price suggests a positive reaction. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago.

Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline. The premarket trading shows a 3.4% increase in Apple's stock price, indicating a positive reaction to the earnings report. Based on the analysis of the news content and the previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates mixed performance in tech stocks in the late afternoon trading. Given the context and the previous predictions, there is a general trend of positivity regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news does not specify any direct impact on Apple, but the overall sentiment from the previous rounds suggests a positive outlook. However, the mixed nature of the news could introduce some uncertainty. The previous models mostly predicted a higher probability of stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. The cautionary notes about China sales and AI rollout do temper this optimism, but the overall positive performance and growth outlook seem to be the dominant factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction in the premarket with a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following strong quarterly results that exceeded earnings expectations.

However, there's also mention of 'mixed performance in key segments,' suggesting some weaknesses. Previous predictions have generally leaned towards a positive outlook, with probabilities of a stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.78. Considering the positive earnings beat and the consensus from previous rounds, I'll maintain a positive outlook, but slightly temper it due to the 'mixed performance' caveat. The trend seems to be stabilizing around 0.7, so I will stick to that.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings significantly exceeded expectations, reporting record revenue and EPS.  The strong performance in services (14% YoY growth) is particularly noteworthy, as it represents a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.  Record iPhone upgrader numbers and robust growth in emerging markets (especially India) further contribute to a positive outlook. However, several factors temper the bullish sentiment.  The 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, attributed partly to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern.

However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability. The pre-market jump of 3.4% also suggests a positive market reaction.  Balancing the positive and negative factors, and considering the consensus of previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price rise is most appropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.
