(AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction in the premarket with a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following strong quarterly results that exceeded earnings expectations. Although iPhone sales slightly decreased, the company's outlook for future sales growth and strong performance in the services division suggest a positive trend. The cautious approach to AI investments may also be viewed favorably in the current market context. Overall, the combination of better-than-expected earnings, a positive outlook, and strong service revenue supports a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings beat analyst estimates, driven by strong services revenue. Beating estimates is generally a positive signal for investors, suggesting the company is performing well. While the news content mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall positive sentiment from beating estimates, particularly due to the high-margin services sector, is likely to outweigh the negative aspects. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall. However, the 'mixed performance' caveat prevents assigning a very high probability to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple reported record revenue and EPS, exceeding expectations.  While this is overwhelmingly positive, several factors temper the bullish outlook.  The decline in Greater China revenue (attributed partly to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there) is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds a layer of caution.  Foreign exchange headwinds are anticipated to negatively impact the next quarter.  However, the strong performance in other regions, record iPhone upgrader numbers (boosted by Apple Intelligence in some markets), and the robust growth in emerging markets (especially India) suggest continued overall strength.  The record installed base and continued growth in services revenue are also very positive indicators.  Weighing the positives and negatives, a price rise is more likely, but the risks associated with China and currency fluctuations prevent a completely optimistic prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Warren Buffett's investment strategy and its position among his longest-held stocks. While Buffett's continued holding of AAPL is a positive signal, the article also highlights potential challenges, such as reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic headwinds. However, the reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday due to a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates. The company's net income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago, with services revenue up 14%. Despite revenue from China being down 11%, the overall strong quarterly performance and positive outlook for growth in the March quarter are likely to boost investor confidence. However, concerns about the rollout of Apple Intelligence and competition in the AI space may temper enthusiasm. Based on the positive earnings report and growth expectations, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Additionally, services revenue was up 14%. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and the rollout of AI services has been slower than expected. Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction in the premarket with a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following strong quarterly results that exceeded earnings expectations. Although iPhone sales slightly decreased, the company's outlook for future sales growth and strong performance in the services division suggest a positive trend. The cautious approach to AI investments may also be viewed favorably in the current market context. Overall, the combination of better-than-expected earnings, a positive outlook, and strong service revenue supports a higher probability of stock price rise, despite some concerns regarding iPhone sales and market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's Q1 earnings exceeded analyst expectations, primarily driven by strong services revenue. This is generally a positive signal for investors. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall positive sentiment from beating estimates, especially due to the high-margin services sector, is likely to outweigh the negative aspects. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, most models leaned towards a positive outlook, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Given this consensus and the positive earnings report, I will adjust my prediction slightly upwards, but not excessively, to account for the 'mixed performance' caveat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows a mixed bag.  Record revenue and EPS are overwhelmingly positive, exceeding expectations and suggesting strong overall performance.  The significant growth in services revenue (14% YoY) is particularly encouraging, as it represents a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.  Record iPhone upgrader numbers and strong performance in emerging markets (especially India) further bolster the positive outlook.  However, several factors temper the enthusiasm. The 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, partly due to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds caution.  Anticipated foreign exchange headwinds will further impact the next quarter.  The previous predictions range from 0.55 to 0.75 probability of a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment. Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth in services, and the positive outlook in emerging markets, I lean towards a higher probability of a price rise. However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability.  The overall positive sentiment from exceeding expectations and strong service revenue is likely to outweigh the negative aspects in the short term, but the long-term impact of the China market challenges remains uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which is a positive signal given Buffett's reputation as a value investor. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% increase in revenue and strong cash flow, which supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance to these concerns. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which generally leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and the current analysis, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago.

Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. The premarket increase of 3.4% in Apple's stock price suggests a positive reaction. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago.

Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline. The premarket trading shows a 3.4% increase in Apple's stock price, indicating a positive reaction to the earnings report. Based on the analysis of the news content and the previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates mixed performance in tech stocks in the late afternoon trading. Given the context and the previous predictions, there is a general trend of positivity regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news does not specify any direct impact on Apple, but the overall sentiment from the previous rounds suggests a positive outlook. However, the mixed nature of the news could introduce some uncertainty. The previous models mostly predicted a higher probability of stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. The cautionary notes about China sales and AI rollout do temper this optimism, but the overall positive performance and growth outlook seem to be the dominant factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction in the premarket with a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following strong quarterly results that exceeded earnings expectations.

However, there's also mention of 'mixed performance in key segments,' suggesting some weaknesses. Previous predictions have generally leaned towards a positive outlook, with probabilities of a stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.78. Considering the positive earnings beat and the consensus from previous rounds, I'll maintain a positive outlook, but slightly temper it due to the 'mixed performance' caveat. The trend seems to be stabilizing around 0.7, so I will stick to that.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings significantly exceeded expectations, reporting record revenue and EPS.  The strong performance in services (14% YoY growth) is particularly noteworthy, as it represents a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.  Record iPhone upgrader numbers and robust growth in emerging markets (especially India) further contribute to a positive outlook. However, several factors temper the bullish sentiment.  The 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, attributed partly to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern.

Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth in services, and the positive outlook in emerging markets, I lean towards a higher probability of a price rise.  However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability. The pre-market jump of 3.4% also suggests a positive market reaction.  Balancing the positive and negative factors, and considering the consensus of previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price rise is most appropriate.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc.

The previous predictions range from 0.55 to 0.75 for the probability of a stock price rise, indicating a general trend of positivity. Considering the mixed performance and the cautious approach to AI investments, I estimate a slightly lower probability compared to previous rounds but still leaning towards a positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.73, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.27, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago.

The previous predictions from various models generally leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Based on the analysis of the news content and the previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates mixed performance in tech stocks in the late afternoon trading.
