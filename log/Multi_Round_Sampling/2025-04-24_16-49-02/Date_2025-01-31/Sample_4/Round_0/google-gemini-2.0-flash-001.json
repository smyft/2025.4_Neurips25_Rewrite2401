Beating estimates is generally a positive signal for investors, suggesting the company is performing well. While the news content mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall positive sentiment from beating estimates, particularly due to the high-margin services sector, is likely to outweigh the negative aspects. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall.
