(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trending tickers: Apple, Intel, Novartis, Shell, Smiths Group\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL)\n\nApple (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday, following a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates.\n\nNet income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago. Meanwhile services revenue was up 14%, with revenue from China down 11%.\n\n\"Overall another very strong quarter,\" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Tipranks. \"It was the first quarterly numbers since the rollout of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s suite of AI features. Apple (AAPL) expects growth in the March quarter of \u201clow to mid-single digits\u201d and \u201clow double digits\u201d growth for its Services division\".\n\nFor the year-to-date Apple (AAPL) stock is 2.6% lower, knocked amid a wider tech rout related to worries around Chinese AI challenger DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of AI services on iPhone 16 hasn\u2019t exactly gone smoothly. Having been late to the AI party in the first place, Apple (AAPL) still hasn\u2019t rolled out AI services in any non-English language,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n\"This cautious pace seems odd when you consider AI has exploded onto the scene and consumers increasingly have a lot of choice for AI-enabled devices. It\u2019s like a carrot dangled in front of Apple (AAPL) and it only wants to nibble at it, rather than devour the whole thing.\"\n\n\u201cConsumers need a reason to upgrade their phone, otherwise they\u2019re going to stick with their current model given how even the cheapest devices are fairly sophisticated these days. Apple (AAPL) is clearly hoping its AI services will be the catalyst to drive handset upgrades, but it\u2019s going about it in a strange way.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel (INTC) stock gained 1.3% on Thursday and was trading 1.7% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly earnings report which beat fourth quarter expectations, but gave a tepid read for the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe CPU and chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, above the analyst estimate of $0.12.\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $14.3bn, beating consensus estimates of $13.8bn but declining 7% year-on-year. For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates. The increase comes off the back of sales of its heart failure drug, Entresto, and multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEntrestro, which will lose its patent protection later this year, saw quarterly revenues jump by a third to $2.2bn.\n\nFor Q4, net income rose 26% to $3.9bn. This surpassed analyst consensus of $3.6bn, Reuters reported.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nOil major Shell (SHEL.L) was trading 0.8% higher in the morning on Friday, building on gains from the week following its quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe company reported a sharp fall in profits in the fourth quarter but declared another $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) share buyback.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $3.66bn in the fourth quarter were down 39% on the $6bn Shell (SHEL.L) posted in the third quarter, according to its latest results. For the year, adjusted earnings were down 16% to $23.7bn, compared to $28.3bn in 2023.\n\nShell said income attributable to shareholders had fallen 78% to $928m in the fourth quarter, down from $4.2bn in previous quarter.\n\nHowever, this figure was higher than the $474m it reported in the same period last year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L) was the top riser in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Friday, up more than 14% after the opening bell following news it had responded to activist investor calls to split up its business. The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure. Next steps will be closely watched, with Engine also floating the possibility of a US listing for its John Crane energy services arm which Engine describes as its jewel in the crown.\u201d\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SMIN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction in the premarket with a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following strong quarterly results that exceeded earnings expectations. Although iPhone sales slightly decreased, the company's outlook for future sales growth and strong performance in the services division suggest a positive trend. The cautious approach to AI investments may also be viewed favorably in the current market context. Overall, the combination of better-than-expected earnings, a positive outlook, and strong service revenue supports a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings beat analyst estimates, driven by strong services revenue. Beating estimates is generally a positive signal for investors, suggesting the company is performing well. While the news content mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall positive sentiment from beating estimates, particularly due to the high-margin services sector, is likely to outweigh the negative aspects. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall. However, the 'mixed performance' caveat prevents assigning a very high probability to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple reported record revenue and EPS, exceeding expectations.  While this is overwhelmingly positive, several factors temper the bullish outlook.  The decline in Greater China revenue (attributed partly to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there) is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds a layer of caution.  Foreign exchange headwinds are anticipated to negatively impact the next quarter.  However, the strong performance in other regions, record iPhone upgrader numbers (boosted by Apple Intelligence in some markets), and the robust growth in emerging markets (especially India) suggest continued overall strength.  The record installed base and continued growth in services revenue are also very positive indicators.  Weighing the positives and negatives, a price rise is more likely, but the risks associated with China and currency fluctuations prevent a completely optimistic prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Warren Buffett's investment strategy and its position among his longest-held stocks. While Buffett's continued holding of AAPL is a positive signal, the article also highlights potential challenges, such as reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic headwinds. However, the reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday due to a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates. The company's net income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago, with services revenue up 14%. Despite revenue from China being down 11%, the overall strong quarterly performance and positive outlook for growth in the March quarter are likely to boost investor confidence. However, concerns about the rollout of Apple Intelligence and competition in the AI space may temper enthusiasm. Based on the positive earnings report and growth expectations, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Additionally, services revenue was up 14%. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and the rollout of AI services has been slower than expected. Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news indicates a positive reaction in the premarket with a 3.5% increase in Apple's stock price following strong quarterly results that exceeded earnings expectations. Although iPhone sales slightly decreased, the company's outlook for future sales growth and strong performance in the services division suggest a positive trend. The cautious approach to AI investments may also be viewed favorably in the current market context. Overall, the combination of better-than-expected earnings, a positive outlook, and strong service revenue supports a higher probability of stock price rise, despite some concerns regarding iPhone sales and market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.78, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.22, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate that Apple's Q1 earnings exceeded analyst expectations, primarily driven by strong services revenue. This is generally a positive signal for investors. While the news mentions 'mixed performance in key segments,' the overall positive sentiment from beating estimates, especially due to the high-margin services sector, is likely to outweigh the negative aspects. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, most models leaned towards a positive outlook, with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. Given this consensus and the positive earnings report, I will adjust my prediction slightly upwards, but not excessively, to account for the 'mixed performance' caveat.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows a mixed bag.  Record revenue and EPS are overwhelmingly positive, exceeding expectations and suggesting strong overall performance.  The significant growth in services revenue (14% YoY) is particularly encouraging, as it represents a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.  Record iPhone upgrader numbers and strong performance in emerging markets (especially India) further bolster the positive outlook.  However, several factors temper the enthusiasm. The 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, partly due to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds caution.  Anticipated foreign exchange headwinds will further impact the next quarter.  The previous predictions range from 0.55 to 0.75 probability of a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment. Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth in services, and the positive outlook in emerging markets, I lean towards a higher probability of a price rise. However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability.  The overall positive sentiment from exceeding expectations and strong service revenue is likely to outweigh the negative aspects in the short term, but the long-term impact of the China market challenges remains uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which is a positive signal given Buffett's reputation as a value investor. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% increase in revenue and strong cash flow, which supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance to these concerns. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which generally leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and the current analysis, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago. Additionally, services revenue was up 14%. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and the rollout of AI services has been slower than expected. Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. The premarket increase of 3.4% in Apple's stock price suggests a positive reaction. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.72, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.28, Reasoning: The news report indicates that Apple's quarterly profit and sales report came in ahead of estimates, with net income up 7% and sales up 4% from the same quarter a year ago.

Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Considering these factors, the overall sentiment is positive, but with some caution due to the slower-than-expected AI rollout and Chinese market decline. The premarket trading shows a 3.4% increase in Apple's stock price, indicating a positive reaction to the earnings report. Based on the analysis of the news content and the previous predictions, which show a range of probabilities but generally lean towards a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates mixed performance in tech stocks in the late afternoon trading. Given the context and the previous predictions, there is a general trend of positivity regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news does not specify any direct impact on Apple, but the overall sentiment from the previous rounds suggests a positive outlook. However, the mixed nature of the news could introduce some uncertainty. The previous models mostly predicted a higher probability of stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. The cautionary notes about China sales and AI rollout do temper this optimism, but the overall positive performance and growth outlook seem to be the dominant factors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
