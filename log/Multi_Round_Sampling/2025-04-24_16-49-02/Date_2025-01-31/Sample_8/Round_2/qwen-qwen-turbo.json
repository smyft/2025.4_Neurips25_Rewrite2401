(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock has risen following the announcement of better-than-expected earnings and a solid growth outlook. Positive earnings reports typically lead to increased investor confidence, which often results in a rise in stock prices. Given the context of the news, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of the stock price rising, while the probability of it falling is significantly lower due to the positive sentiment surrounding the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company's Q4 earnings and revenue showed growth, and the market reacted favorably (though perhaps more out of relief than excitement), there are significant concerns. The primary negative factor is the increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, which disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's ongoing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies,  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns about a potential mismatch in hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty regarding an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  The analyst's cautious stance and lack of bullish sentiment suggest a relatively low probability of a significant price increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news counterbalances the potential positive impact of Apple's less vulnerable position regarding DeepSeek. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise, although neither is overwhelmingly likely based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analyst expectations and has already led to a 3% rise in late trading. Additionally, strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, along with record revenue and profit, are bullish signals. However, significant declines in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and challenges in wearables and AI competitiveness are concerning. The market's reaction to the news seems cautiously optimistic, but underlying issues in China and AI lag could weigh on sentiment. Given the immediate positive reaction and the overall mixed but slightly positive tone of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's AI moment, which could be a significant driver for stock price movement, is still not imminent. The article implies that while there is interest in AI-related news, it does not currently translate into immediate action for iPhone upgrades. This indicates a neutral or slightly negative outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term, as the market may have already priced in some expectations for AI-driven growth that isn't being met with immediate upgrades or enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending, which could be a positive factor for the company. However, the analyst's Hold rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI boom suggest that the news may not have a significant immediate impact on the stock price. Additionally, the fact that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model makes the company less vulnerable to the emergence of DeepSeek is a positive factor. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to slightly positive, but the analyst's cautious stance and the lack of clear evidence of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle from AI suggest that the probability of a significant stock price rise is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates mixed signals for the market and Apple specifically. Higher futures suggest overall positive sentiment. However, Trump's tariff threats and the upcoming PCE report could increase market volatility. Apple's guidance surpassing expectations and CEO's statement on AI boosting sales are optimistic signs. This outweighs the initial dip due to slightly lower iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided a solid growth outlook, which typically boosts investor confidence and leads to a rise in stock prices. However, there are mixed signals regarding competition, particularly in China, and concerns about iPhone demand and AI challenges. Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment from the earnings report is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While the company's Q4 earnings showed growth and the market reacted favorably (though perhaps more out of relief than excitement), there are significant concerns, especially regarding China. The increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's continuing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight downward trend in the probability of the stock rising. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive factor in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This indicates a lack of strong bullish sentiment. Concerns remain about the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a high probability of a price fall.  The overall sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the lack of strong positive catalysts and the analyst's cautious outlook suggest that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low. Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate, with slightly higher probability assigned to a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations).\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include a reassuring revenue forecast, strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, and record revenue and profit. These have already led to a 3% rise in late trading. However, significant declines in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and challenges in wearables and AI competitiveness are concerning. The market's reaction seems cautiously optimistic, but underlying issues could weigh on sentiment. Considering the immediate positive reaction and overall mixed but slightly positive tone, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that the market may have already anticipated a more immediate impact from AI on Apple's stock price. The content indicates that while there is some positive sentiment from the DeepSeek news, it is not yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones. This mixed outlook, with both positive and negative factors, leads to a cautious stance. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with some models indicating a higher likelihood of a stock price rise (e.g., 0.75, 0.65, 0.6) and others a higher likelihood of a fall (e.g., 0.6, 0.45). Considering the overall neutral to slightly positive tone of the news and the market's current cautious optimism, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with the analyst expressing concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI boom, but also highlighting the company's less vulnerable position regarding DeepSeek. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a range of opinions on the stock price movement, from a high probability of rising to a high probability of falling. However, most models agree that the news is neutral to slightly positive. Taking into account the analyst's cautious stance and the lack of clear evidence of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle from AI, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting Apple Inc., including its earnings report, Trump's tariff threats, and broader market conditions. Apple's earnings guidance exceeded expectations, pointing towards momentum in iPhone demand, which is a positive signal. However, there are concerns such as Trump's tariff threats and the potential for increased inflation as indicated by the PCE report, both of which could negatively impact the stock price. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall. Given the mixed signals, the positive earnings guidance is a strong indicator, but caution is advised due to external factors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
