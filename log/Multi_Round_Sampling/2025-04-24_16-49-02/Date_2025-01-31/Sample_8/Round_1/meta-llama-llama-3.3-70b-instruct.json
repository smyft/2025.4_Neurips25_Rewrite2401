(AAPL)\nNews Headline: How Apple can 'leverage' Big Tech players' AI spending\nNews Content: Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to examine Apple's (AAPL) earnings print, analyzing what the results signal about a possible iPhone upgrade cycle and where Apple stands in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\n\"If we've learned anything from the last two quarters, September and December, from Apple, it's that mismatch in the timing of the hardware rollout ... and the software rollout ... has weighed on iPhone sales,\" Forte says.\n\nHe explains his Hold rating on Apple stock, noting, \"It isn't clear to me yet that we're going to get this super-cycle, or much less an upgrade cycle from AI.\"\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek negatively impacted several Big Tech names, such as Nvidia (NVDA). Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock has risen following the announcement of better-than-expected earnings and a solid growth outlook. Positive earnings reports typically lead to increased investor confidence, which often results in a rise in stock prices. Given the context of the news, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of the stock price rising, while the probability of it falling is significantly lower due to the positive sentiment surrounding the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company's Q4 earnings and revenue showed growth, and the market reacted favorably (though perhaps more out of relief than excitement), there are significant concerns. The primary negative factor is the increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, which disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's ongoing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies,  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns about a potential mismatch in hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty regarding an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  The analyst's cautious stance and lack of bullish sentiment suggest a relatively low probability of a significant price increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news counterbalances the potential positive impact of Apple's less vulnerable position regarding DeepSeek. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise, although neither is overwhelmingly likely based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analyst expectations and has already led to a 3% rise in late trading. Additionally, strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, along with record revenue and profit, are bullish signals. However, significant declines in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and challenges in wearables and AI competitiveness are concerning. The market's reaction to the news seems cautiously optimistic, but underlying issues in China and AI lag could weigh on sentiment. Given the immediate positive reaction and the overall mixed but slightly positive tone of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's AI moment, which could be a significant driver for stock price movement, is still not imminent. The article implies that while there is interest in AI-related news, it does not currently translate into immediate action for iPhone upgrades. This indicates a neutral or slightly negative outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term, as the market may have already priced in some expectations for AI-driven growth that isn't being met with immediate upgrades or enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending, which could be a positive factor for the company. However, the analyst's Hold rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI boom suggest that the news may not have a significant immediate impact on the stock price. Additionally, the fact that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model makes the company less vulnerable to the emergence of DeepSeek is a positive factor. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to slightly positive, but the analyst's cautious stance and the lack of clear evidence of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle from AI suggest that the probability of a significant stock price rise is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates mixed signals for the market and Apple specifically. Higher futures suggest overall positive sentiment. However, Trump's tariff threats and the upcoming PCE report could increase market volatility. Apple's guidance surpassing expectations and CEO's statement on AI boosting sales are optimistic signs. This outweighs the initial dip due to slightly lower iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
