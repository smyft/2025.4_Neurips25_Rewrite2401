      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: How Apple can 'leverage' Big Tech players' AI spending\nNews Content: Maxim Group managing director and senior consumer internet analyst Tom Forte joins Catalysts with Seana Smith and Josh Schafer to examine Apple's (AAPL) earnings print, analyzing what the results signal about a possible iPhone upgrade cycle and where Apple stands in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom.\n\n\"If we've learned anything from the last two quarters, September and December, from Apple, it's that mismatch in the timing of the hardware rollout ... and the software rollout ... has weighed on iPhone sales,\" Forte says.\n\nHe explains his Hold rating on Apple stock, noting, \"It isn't clear to me yet that we're going to get this super-cycle, or much less an upgrade cycle from AI.\"\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek negatively impacted several Big Tech names, such as Nvidia (NVDA). Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock has risen following the announcement of better-than-expected earnings and a solid growth outlook. Positive earnings reports typically lead to increased investor confidence, which often results in a rise in stock prices. Given the context of the news, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of the stock price rising, while the probability of it falling is significantly lower due to the positive sentiment surrounding the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company's Q4 earnings and revenue showed growth, and the market reacted favorably (though perhaps more out of relief than excitement), there are significant concerns. The primary negative factor is the increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, which disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's ongoing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies,  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns about a potential mismatch in hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty regarding an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  The analyst's cautious stance and lack of bullish sentiment suggest a relatively low probability of a significant price increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news counterbalances the potential positive impact of Apple's less vulnerable position regarding DeepSeek. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise, although neither is overwhelmingly likely based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analyst expectations and has already led to a 3% rise in late trading. Additionally, strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, along with record revenue and profit, are bullish signals. However, significant declines in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and challenges in wearables and AI competitiveness are concerning. The market's reaction to the news seems cautiously optimistic, but underlying issues in China and AI lag could weigh on sentiment. Given the immediate positive reaction and the overall mixed but slightly positive tone of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's AI moment, which could be a significant driver for stock price movement, is still not imminent. The article implies that while there is interest in AI-related news, it does not currently translate into immediate action for iPhone upgrades. This indicates a neutral or slightly negative outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term, as the market may have already priced in some expectations for AI-driven growth that isn't being met with immediate upgrades or enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending, which could be a positive factor for the company. However, the analyst's Hold rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI boom suggest that the news may not have a significant immediate impact on the stock price. Additionally, the fact that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model makes the company less vulnerable to the emergence of DeepSeek is a positive factor. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to slightly positive, but the analyst's cautious stance and the lack of clear evidence of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle from AI suggest that the probability of a significant stock price rise is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates mixed signals for the market and Apple specifically. Higher futures suggest overall positive sentiment. However, Trump's tariff threats and the upcoming PCE report could increase market volatility. Apple's guidance surpassing expectations and CEO's statement on AI boosting sales are optimistic signs. This outweighs the initial dip due to slightly lower iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided a solid growth outlook, which typically boosts investor confidence and leads to a rise in stock prices. However, there are mixed signals regarding competition, particularly in China, and concerns about iPhone demand and AI challenges. Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment from the earnings report is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While the company's Q4 earnings showed growth and the market reacted favorably (though perhaps more out of relief than excitement), there are significant concerns, especially regarding China. The increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's continuing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight downward trend in the probability of the stock rising. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive factor in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This indicates a lack of strong bullish sentiment. Concerns remain about the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a high probability of a price fall.  The overall sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the lack of strong positive catalysts and the analyst's cautious outlook suggest that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low. Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate, with slightly higher probability assigned to a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations).\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include a reassuring revenue forecast, strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, and record revenue and profit. These have already led to a 3% rise in late trading. However, significant declines in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and challenges in wearables and AI competitiveness are concerning. The market's reaction seems cautiously optimistic, but underlying issues could weigh on sentiment. Considering the immediate positive reaction and overall mixed but slightly positive tone, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that the market may have already anticipated a more immediate impact from AI on Apple's stock price. The content indicates that while there is some positive sentiment from the DeepSeek news, it is not yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones. This mixed outlook, with both positive and negative factors, leads to a cautious stance. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with some models indicating a higher likelihood of a stock price rise (e.g., 0.75, 0.65, 0.6) and others a higher likelihood of a fall (e.g., 0.6, 0.45). Considering the overall neutral to slightly positive tone of the news and the market's current cautious optimism, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with the analyst expressing concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI boom, but also highlighting the company's less vulnerable position regarding DeepSeek. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a range of opinions on the stock price movement, from a high probability of rising to a high probability of falling. However, most models agree that the news is neutral to slightly positive. Taking into account the analyst's cautious stance and the lack of clear evidence of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle from AI, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting Apple Inc., including its earnings report, Trump's tariff threats, and broader market conditions. Apple's earnings guidance exceeded expectations, pointing towards momentum in iPhone demand, which is a positive signal. However, there are concerns such as Trump's tariff threats and the potential for increased inflation as indicated by the PCE report, both of which could negatively impact the stock price. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall. Given the mixed signals, the positive earnings guidance is a strong indicator, but caution is advised due to external factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided a solid growth outlook, which typically boosts investor confidence and leads to a rise in stock prices. However, there are mixed signals regarding competition, particularly in China, and concerns about iPhone demand and AI challenges. Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment from the earnings report is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Considering the previous predictions, there is a consensus leaning towards a moderate probability of a price rise, but caution is warranted due to the underlying challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q4 earnings were up and the market reacted favorably, concerns remain about competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with potential tariffs. Apple's AI struggles are also a factor. Previous predictions are varied, with a slight downward trend in the probability of the stock rising. Considering these factors, a neutral stance is appropriate, with a slightly higher probability assigned to a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations). However, the China risk is significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This indicates a lack of strong bullish sentiment. Concerns remain about the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise (0.75) to a high probability of a price fall (0.6).  However, there's a clear trend towards a more neutral stance in the second round of predictions. The overall sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations), but the lack of strong positive catalysts and the analyst's cautious outlook suggest that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low.  Considering the mixed signals and the convergence of previous predictions towards a more neutral assessment, a probability slightly favoring a rise reflects the balance of positive and negative factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Apple's AI struggles are also a factor. Previous predictions are varied, with a slight downward trend in the probability of the stock rising. Considering these factors, a neutral stance is appropriate. The positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations) are balanced by the China risk. The trend in previous predictions shows a convergence towards a more neutral outlook. Therefore, I am slightly decreasing the probability of a rise and increasing the probability of a fall compared to the previous round.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company exceeded revenue expectations and its hybrid CapEx model offers some protection against the DeepSeek impact on other tech giants, significant concerns remain.  The analyst's 'Hold' rating reflects uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle and potential iPhone sales headwinds due to mismatched hardware and software rollouts.  China sales remain a significant concern.  Previous predictions show a convergence towards a neutral stance, with probabilities for a price rise and fall clustering around 0.5.  Considering the balanced nature of the news and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative catalysts, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, reflecting the positive earnings report and the company's relatively resilient position regarding DeepSeek. However, the persistent concerns regarding iPhone sales and the broader economic climate warrant caution.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
