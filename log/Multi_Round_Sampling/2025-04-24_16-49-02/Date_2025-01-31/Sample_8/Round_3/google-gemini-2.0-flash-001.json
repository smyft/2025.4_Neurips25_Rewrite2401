(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings &amp; DeepSeek: What Should Investors Know?\nNews Content: DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. The +25.6% earnings growth comprises actual results from the four group members that have reported and estimates for Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia (that haven\u2019t reported yet).Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below that shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.2% from the same period last year on +10.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks in the fore front of the rising estimates trend. The +16.9% earnings growth expected for the sector for 2025 at present is up from the +15.8% growth expected three months back.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 31st, we have seen Q4 results from 179 S&P 500 members, or 35.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues, with 80.4% beating EPS estimates and 67% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 132 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Pfizer, Pepsi, Ford, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players (Amazon and Alphabet).\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 63% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.6% on +4.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock has risen following the announcement of better-than-expected earnings and a solid growth outlook. Positive earnings reports typically lead to increased investor confidence, which often results in a rise in stock prices. Given the context of the news, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of the stock price rising, while the probability of it falling is significantly lower due to the positive sentiment surrounding the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company's Q4 earnings and revenue showed growth, and the market reacted favorably (though perhaps more out of relief than excitement), there are significant concerns. The primary negative factor is the increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, which disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's ongoing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies,  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns about a potential mismatch in hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty regarding an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  The analyst's cautious stance and lack of bullish sentiment suggest a relatively low probability of a significant price increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news counterbalances the potential positive impact of Apple's less vulnerable position regarding DeepSeek. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise, although neither is overwhelmingly likely based solely on this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, the company provided a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, which aligns with analyst expectations and has already led to a 3% rise in late trading. Additionally, strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, along with record revenue and profit, are bullish signals. However, significant declines in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and challenges in wearables and AI competitiveness are concerning. The market's reaction to the news seems cautiously optimistic, but underlying issues in China and AI lag could weigh on sentiment. Given the immediate positive reaction and the overall mixed but slightly positive tone of the news, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Apple's AI moment, which could be a significant driver for stock price movement, is still not imminent. The article implies that while there is interest in AI-related news, it does not currently translate into immediate action for iPhone upgrades. This indicates a neutral or slightly negative outlook for Apple's stock price in the short term, as the market may have already priced in some expectations for AI-driven growth that isn't being met with immediate upgrades or enthusiasm.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential to leverage Big Tech players' AI spending, which could be a positive factor for the company. However, the analyst's Hold rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI boom suggest that the news may not have a significant immediate impact on the stock price. Additionally, the fact that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model makes the company less vulnerable to the emergence of DeepSeek is a positive factor. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to slightly positive, but the analyst's cautious stance and the lack of clear evidence of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle from AI suggest that the probability of a significant stock price rise is relatively low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates mixed signals for the market and Apple specifically. Higher futures suggest overall positive sentiment. However, Trump's tariff threats and the upcoming PCE report could increase market volatility. Apple's guidance surpassing expectations and CEO's statement on AI boosting sales are optimistic signs. This outweighs the initial dip due to slightly lower iPhone sales in the holiday quarter.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided a solid growth outlook, which typically boosts investor confidence and leads to a rise in stock prices. However, there are mixed signals regarding competition, particularly in China, and concerns about iPhone demand and AI challenges. Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment from the earnings report is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. While the company's Q4 earnings showed growth and the market reacted favorably (though perhaps more out of relief than excitement), there are significant concerns, especially regarding China. The increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's continuing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight downward trend in the probability of the stock rising. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive factor in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This indicates a lack of strong bullish sentiment. Concerns remain about the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a high probability of a price fall.  The overall sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the lack of strong positive catalysts and the analyst's cautious outlook suggest that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low. Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate, with slightly higher probability assigned to a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations).\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Positive factors include a reassuring revenue forecast, strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, and record revenue and profit. These have already led to a 3% rise in late trading. However, significant declines in China sales, weaker-than-expected iPhone performance, and challenges in wearables and AI competitiveness are concerning. The market's reaction seems cautiously optimistic, but underlying issues could weigh on sentiment. Considering the immediate positive reaction and overall mixed but slightly positive tone, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline 'Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off' suggests that the market may have already anticipated a more immediate impact from AI on Apple's stock price. The content indicates that while there is some positive sentiment from the DeepSeek news, it is not yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones. This mixed outlook, with both positive and negative factors, leads to a cautious stance. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with some models indicating a higher likelihood of a stock price rise (e.g., 0.75, 0.65, 0.6) and others a higher likelihood of a fall (e.g., 0.6, 0.45). Considering the overall neutral to slightly positive tone of the news and the market's current cautious optimism, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with the analyst expressing concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI boom, but also highlighting the company's less vulnerable position regarding DeepSeek. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a range of opinions on the stock price movement, from a high probability of rising to a high probability of falling. However, most models agree that the news is neutral to slightly positive. Taking into account the analyst's cautious stance and the lack of clear evidence of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle from AI, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting Apple Inc., including its earnings report, Trump's tariff threats, and broader market conditions. Apple's earnings guidance exceeded expectations, pointing towards momentum in iPhone demand, which is a positive signal. However, there are concerns such as Trump's tariff threats and the potential for increased inflation as indicated by the PCE report, both of which could negatively impact the stock price. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall. Given the mixed signals, the positive earnings guidance is a strong indicator, but caution is advised due to external factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided a solid growth outlook, which typically boosts investor confidence and leads to a rise in stock prices. However, there are mixed signals regarding competition, particularly in China, and concerns about iPhone demand and AI challenges. Despite these concerns, the overall sentiment from the earnings report is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of stock price appreciation. Considering the previous predictions, there is a consensus leaning towards a moderate probability of a price rise, but caution is warranted due to the underlying challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q4 earnings were up and the market reacted favorably, concerns remain about competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with potential tariffs. Apple's AI struggles are also a factor. Previous predictions are varied, with a slight downward trend in the probability of the stock rising. Considering these factors, a neutral stance is appropriate, with a slightly higher probability assigned to a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations). However, the China risk is significant.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This indicates a lack of strong bullish sentiment. Concerns remain about the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise (0.75) to a high probability of a price fall (0.6).  However, there's a clear trend towards a more neutral stance in the second round of predictions. The overall sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations), but the lack of strong positive catalysts and the analyst's cautious outlook suggest that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low.  Considering the mixed signals and the convergence of previous predictions towards a more neutral assessment, a probability slightly favoring a rise reflects the balance of positive and negative factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL).
