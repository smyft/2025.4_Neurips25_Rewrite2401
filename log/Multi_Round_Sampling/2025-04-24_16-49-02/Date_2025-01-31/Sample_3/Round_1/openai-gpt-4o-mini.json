A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised concerns about competition and market dynamics. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to cautious trading around Apple's stock, especially if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Given the current market environment, there is a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollouts could weigh on iPhone sales, and the analyst expresses uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. This suggests potential downside risk. On the other hand, Apple's hybrid CapEx model, allowing it to leverage other companies' AI investments, is seen as a positive, making it less vulnerable to competition like DeepSeek. The analyst maintains a 'Hold' rating, indicating a neutral stance. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the concerns about iPhone sales and the lack of a clear AI-driven upgrade cycle, but the mitigated risk from AI competition prevents a strong bearish outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: Apple's stock jumped 3.5% pre-market following the release of its quarterly earnings. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, the overall results exceeded analyst predictions, particularly in services revenue.  The positive outlook for the next quarter, suggesting continued strong iPhone demand, further boosted investor confidence.  The cautious approach to AI investments, while potentially limiting future growth in that sector, also appears to have been viewed positively by the market given recent volatility in the tech sector.  The combination of exceeding expectations in key areas, a positive outlook, and a relatively stable performance during recent market turbulence suggests a high probability of continued upward price movement in the short term. However, the slight miss on iPhone sales and the uncertainty surrounding future AI investments introduce some risk of a price correction.  Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, the possibility of a fall cannot be entirely discounted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed quarterly report for Apple Inc. (AAPL), with some positive and negative aspects. On the positive side, the company's sales outlook for the next quarter surpassed expectations, indicating momentum in iPhone demand, particularly in regions where Apple Intelligence features are available. Services revenue also exceeded estimates, showing strong growth. However, iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, and Greater China sales were significantly below projections, reflecting intense competition. Despite these negatives, the overall market reaction seems positive, with shares rising in premarket trading. The rosier sales outlook and the potential for Apple Intelligence to boost future sales seem to be outweighing the negatives. However, the competition in China and missed iPhone sales estimates introduce some downside risk.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not contain specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) that would directly influence its stock price. The headline mentions a general roundup of market talks covering Technology, Media, and Telecom, including Apple, but does not provide any specific details that could be considered positive or negative catalysts for the stock. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or minimal. Given the lack of specific information, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news as being close to equal, but slightly leaning towards no significant change.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cloud platforms, specifically highlighting PracticeSuite's launch of AI capabilities within their cloud-based medical software solutions. While this development is positive for the cloud AI sector, the article does not directly mention any significant positive news about Apple Inc. (AAPL). In fact, Apple's stock price is mentioned as finishing trading at $237.59, down 0.7%. However, the overall trend in the cloud AI sector seems to be positive, with other companies like NEC and Super Micro Computer experiencing gains. Given this context, the probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news is relatively low, while the probability of it falling is also not extremely high, considering the general positive trend in the sector.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
