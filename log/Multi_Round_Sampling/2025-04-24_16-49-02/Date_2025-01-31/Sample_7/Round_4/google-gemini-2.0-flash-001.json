(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which generally reflects positive market sentiment. Additionally, the fact that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge met expectations suggests stability in the economic environment, which can lead to increased investor confidence. Given that Apple Inc. is a major player in the market, it is likely to benefit from this positive sentiment. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple has canceled a project for Mac-connected AR glasses, which is a negative signal. This suggests potential issues with innovation in the AR/VR space, especially given Meta's progress. While Apple is still working on other AR/VR projects and successors to the Vision Pro, the cancellation raises concerns about their ability to compete effectively in this emerging market. The article also mentions internal issues within the Vision Products Group, including a lack of focus and clear direction, which further contributes to the negative sentiment. However, Tim Cook's positive comments on the Vision Pro and ongoing work on underlying AR technologies provide some counterbalancing positive factors. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple in a roundup of market talks, but provides no specific information about the company.  The lack of specific news regarding Apple makes it highly unlikely that this particular news item will significantly impact the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are assumed to be close to the baseline probability of movement in the absence of news.  Any movement is more likely to be due to broader market forces or other unrelated news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were higher on Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to be positively influenced by the overall sector performance. Given the limited information available (as the full article is behind a paywall), the general upward trend in tech stocks suggests a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. However, without specific details about Apple's performance or other influencing factors, the probabilities are estimated based on sector trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday due to a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates. The company's net income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago. Services revenue was up 14%, although revenue from China was down 11%. The company expects growth in the March quarter of 'low to mid-single digits' and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Despite the positive report, some analysts expressed caution regarding the rollout of AI services and its potential impact on future upgrades. However, the immediate market reaction suggests a positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential performance of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025, with a focus on its largest holdings, including Apple. The article highlights concerns about the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, as well as Apple's strategic challenges, particularly its decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership. These factors introduce meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook. However, the article also notes the long-term growth potential of the fund, driven by the transformative effects of artificial intelligence. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, due to the near-term challenges and risks mentioned in the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Additionally, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations suggests stability in the economic environment, likely boosting investor confidence. While there are mixed signals regarding Apple's innovation and internal challenges, the overall positive market sentiment and the performance of tech stocks, including Apple, suggest a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news that Apple has scrapped its Mac-connected AR glasses project is a negative signal. It suggests difficulties in Apple's AR strategy and execution, especially given Meta's progress in the space. The article also highlights internal issues within Apple's Vision Products Group, indicating a lack of focus and clear direction. While Apple is still working on other AR/VR projects and successors to the Vision Pro, the cancellation raises concerns about their ability to compete effectively in this emerging market. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models initially leaning positive due to broader market trends, but others turning negative due to Apple-specific challenges. Considering the negative news and the trend in previous predictions, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline is extremely vague, offering no specific information about Apple.  The accompanying text only mentions Apple in a roundup of market talks.  Therefore, this news item is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term movement. Some models point to positive market sentiment and strong Apple earnings reports as reasons for optimism, while others cite concerns about AR/VR projects and the competitive landscape.  Given the lack of substantial news directly related to Apple, it's most reasonable to assume the probability of a price rise or fall is close to equal, reflecting the influence of broader market factors and other news not included in this headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general positive trend in tech stocks, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) gaining.
