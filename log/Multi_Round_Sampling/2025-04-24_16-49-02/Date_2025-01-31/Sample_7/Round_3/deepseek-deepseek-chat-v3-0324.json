      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Sector Update: Tech Stocks Gain Friday Afternoon\nNews Content: Tech stocks were higher Friday afternoon, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) adding 0\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription? Sign in\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which generally reflects positive market sentiment. Additionally, the fact that the Fed's preferred inflation gauge met expectations suggests stability in the economic environment, which can lead to increased investor confidence. Given that Apple Inc. is a major player in the market, it is likely to benefit from this positive sentiment. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news indicates Apple has canceled a project for Mac-connected AR glasses, which is a negative signal. This suggests potential issues with innovation in the AR/VR space, especially given Meta's progress. While Apple is still working on other AR/VR projects and successors to the Vision Pro, the cancellation raises concerns about their ability to compete effectively in this emerging market. The article also mentions internal issues within the Vision Products Group, including a lack of focus and clear direction, which further contributes to the negative sentiment. However, Tim Cook's positive comments on the Vision Pro and ongoing work on underlying AR technologies provide some counterbalancing positive factors. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.49, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline mentions Apple in a roundup of market talks, but provides no specific information about the company.  The lack of specific news regarding Apple makes it highly unlikely that this particular news item will significantly impact the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are assumed to be close to the baseline probability of movement in the absence of news.  Any movement is more likely to be due to broader market forces or other unrelated news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were higher on Friday afternoon. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to be positively influenced by the overall sector performance. Given the limited information available (as the full article is behind a paywall), the general upward trend in tech stocks suggests a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. However, without specific details about Apple's performance or other influencing factors, the probabilities are estimated based on sector trends.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday due to a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates. The company's net income was up 7% and sales were 4% higher from the same quarter a year ago. Services revenue was up 14%, although revenue from China was down 11%. The company expects growth in the March quarter of 'low to mid-single digits' and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. Despite the positive report, some analysts expressed caution regarding the rollout of AI services and its potential impact on future upgrades. However, the immediate market reaction suggests a positive outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential performance of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025, with a focus on its largest holdings, including Apple. The article highlights concerns about the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, as well as Apple's strategic challenges, particularly its decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership. These factors introduce meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook. However, the article also notes the long-term growth potential of the fund, driven by the transformative effects of artificial intelligence. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, due to the near-term challenges and risks mentioned in the article.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.68, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.32, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which generally reflects positive market sentiment. Additionally, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations suggests stability in the economic environment, likely boosting investor confidence. While there are mixed signals regarding Apple's innovation and internal challenges, the overall positive market sentiment and the performance of tech stocks, including Apple, suggest a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news that Apple has scrapped its Mac-connected AR glasses project is a negative signal. It suggests difficulties in Apple's AR strategy and execution, especially given Meta's progress in the space. The article also highlights internal issues within Apple's Vision Products Group, indicating a lack of focus and clear direction. While Apple is still working on other AR/VR projects and successors to the Vision Pro, the cancellation raises concerns about their ability to compete effectively in this emerging market. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models initially leaning positive due to broader market trends, but others turning negative due to Apple-specific challenges. Considering the negative news and the trend in previous predictions, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is higher.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news headline is extremely vague, offering no specific information about Apple.  The accompanying text only mentions Apple in a roundup of market talks.  Therefore, this news item is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term movement. Some models point to positive market sentiment and strong Apple earnings reports as reasons for optimism, while others cite concerns about AR/VR projects and the competitive landscape.  Given the lack of substantial news directly related to Apple, it's most reasonable to assume the probability of a price rise or fall is close to equal, reflecting the influence of broader market factors and other news not included in this headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a general positive trend in tech stocks, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) gaining. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major component of the tech sector and is likely to benefit from this positive sector movement. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models (like GPT-4o-mini and deepseek-chat-v3-0324) leaning towards a higher probability of a rise due to sector performance, while others (like gemini-2.0-flash-001 and llama-3.3-70b-instruct) highlight potential negative factors such as project cancellations or strategic challenges. Given the limited specific information about Apple in the headline and the overall positive sector trend, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. However, the mixed signals from previous predictions suggest some uncertainty.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock was trading 3.4% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly profit and sales report that came in ahead of estimates.

The company expects growth in the March quarter of 'low to mid-single digits' and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. This positive financial report and outlook likely contributed to the increased stock price. However, some analysts expressed caution regarding the rollout of AI services and its potential impact on future upgrades. Despite these concerns, the immediate market reaction and overall positive report suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising rather than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the potential performance of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025, with a focus on its largest holdings, including Apple. The article highlights concerns about the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, as well as Apple's strategic challenges, particularly its decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership. These factors introduce meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook. However, the article also notes the long-term growth potential of the fund, driven by the transformative effects of artificial intelligence. Considering the mixed signals and the overall trend of others' predictions, I estimate that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that tech stocks, including the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK), were performing well on Friday afternoon. Given that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a significant player in the technology sector, it is likely to benefit from the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector. Moreover, previous predictions suggest a mixed but generally bullish trend for Apple's stock, with some models predicting a higher likelihood of a stock price rise despite some concerns. Considering all these factors, the overall probability of a stock price rise appears to be higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that US equity indexes are trading close to record highs, which generally reflects positive market sentiment. Additionally, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge meeting expectations suggests stability in the economic environment, likely boosting investor confidence. While there are mixed signals regarding Apple's innovation and internal challenges, the overall positive market sentiment and the performance of tech stocks, including Apple, suggest a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising.

It indicates potential issues with Apple's innovation pipeline in the AR/VR space, especially considering Meta's advancements. The article also highlights internal issues within the Vision Products Group, suggesting a lack of focus and clear direction. While Apple is still working on other AR/VR projects, the cancellation raises concerns about their ability to compete effectively. The previous rounds show a trend towards negative sentiment as the specific news about the AR project cancellation outweighs general market optimism. Therefore, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is extremely vague, offering no specific information about Apple beyond mentioning it in a roundup of market talks.

Given the absence of substantial, Apple-specific news, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are heavily influenced by broader market factors and other news not included in this headline.  The consensus from the previous rounds leans slightly towards a rise, but the uncertainty warrants a prediction closer to even odds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a positive trend in tech stocks, with the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) gaining.

(AAPL). The previous rounds of predictions show a mixture of opinions, with some models indicating a higher probability of a stock price rise due to strong quarterly reports and positive market sentiment, while others express concern over project cancellations and strategic challenges.
