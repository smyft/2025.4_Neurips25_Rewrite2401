(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised concerns about competition and market dynamics. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to cautious trading around Apple's stock, especially if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Given the current market environment and the potential for negative sentiment to affect Apple's stock, there is a higher probability of a price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, there's general concern about the rise of Chinese AI, particularly DeepSeek, which has caused market volatility and scrutiny of Big Tech's AI investments. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, especially if its AI strategy is perceived as lagging. The fact that Nvidia had to address its tumbling stock due to DeepSeek's advance suggests a real competitive threat. However, the article also mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction will depend on those results. Meta's positive reaction to its earnings beat, driven by AI investments, suggests that strong earnings and a clear AI strategy could boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment seems cautious due to DeepSeek, but a strong earnings report from Apple could offset this concern. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general market unease, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI and its impact on the tech sector, with Apple (AAPL) positioned as a significant player.  However, the article also notes that Apple's recent integration of AI into its products, while generating record revenue, hasn't resulted in a significant sales boost for the iPhone 16.  This suggests that the market's immediate reaction to Apple's AI initiatives might be muted.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only 6th on Coatue's list of most important AI stocks further tempers expectations of a dramatic price surge. While the long-term prospects for Apple in the AI space are positive, the short-term impact of this specific news is likely to be less pronounced. The overall market sentiment towards AI is bullish, which could provide some support to AAPL, but the lack of immediate, substantial financial gains from Apple's AI integration suggests a more moderate price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth projections typically lead to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock, which drives the price up. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price rose 3.4% in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. The company's executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, indicating a recovery from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features. This positive forecast and the subsequent rise in premarket trading suggest a favorable short-term outlook for the stock. However, the broader market's reaction to the upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions could influence the stock's movement. Given the positive premarket performance and forecast, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where artificial intelligence features have been rolled out, which is a positive sign for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features has also had a negative impact. Considering the overall positive impact of AI on sales, it's likely that the stock price will rise, but the limited rollout might temper the increase. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns about Apple's struggle to innovate in AI, coupled with a downgrade from Oppenheimer and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors indicate negative sentiment towards the company's future growth prospects, particularly in AI, which could lead to a decline in investor confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
