A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised concerns about competition and market dynamics. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to cautious trading around Apple's stock, especially if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Given the current market environment and the potential for negative sentiment to affect Apple's stock, there is a higher probability of a price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, there's general concern about the rise of Chinese AI, particularly DeepSeek, which has caused market volatility and scrutiny of Big Tech's AI investments. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, especially if its AI strategy is perceived as lagging. The fact that Nvidia had to address its tumbling stock due to DeepSeek's advance suggests a real competitive threat. However, the article also mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction will depend on those results. Meta's positive reaction to its earnings beat, driven by AI investments, suggests that strong earnings and a clear AI strategy could boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment seems cautious due to DeepSeek, but a strong earnings report from Apple could offset this concern. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general market unease, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI and its impact on the tech sector, with Apple (AAPL) positioned as a significant player.  However, the article also notes that Apple's recent integration of AI into its products, while generating record revenue, hasn't resulted in a significant sales boost for the iPhone 16.  This suggests that the market's immediate reaction to Apple's AI initiatives might be muted.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only 6th on Coatue's list of most important AI stocks further tempers expectations of a dramatic price surge. While the long-term prospects for Apple in the AI space are positive, the short-term impact of this specific news is likely to be less pronounced. The overall market sentiment towards AI is bullish, which could provide some support to AAPL, but the lack of immediate, substantial financial gains from Apple's AI integration suggests a more moderate price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth projections typically lead to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock, which drives the price up. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price rose 3.4% in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. The company's executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, indicating a recovery from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features. This positive forecast and the subsequent rise in premarket trading suggest a favorable short-term outlook for the stock. However, the broader market's reaction to the upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions could influence the stock's movement. Given the positive premarket performance and forecast, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where artificial intelligence features have been rolled out, which is a positive sign for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features has also had a negative impact. Considering the overall positive impact of AI on sales, it's likely that the stock price will rise, but the limited rollout might temper the increase. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns about Apple's struggle to innovate in AI, coupled with a downgrade from Oppenheimer and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors indicate negative sentiment towards the company's future growth prospects, particularly in AI, which could lead to a decline in investor confidence.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
