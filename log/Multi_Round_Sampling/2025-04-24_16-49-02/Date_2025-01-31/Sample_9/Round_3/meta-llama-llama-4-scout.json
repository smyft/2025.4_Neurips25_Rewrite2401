(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple lifts US stock index futures as crucial inflation test looms\nNews Content: (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised concerns about competition and market dynamics. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to cautious trading around Apple's stock, especially if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Given the current market environment and the potential for negative sentiment to affect Apple's stock, there is a higher probability of a price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, there's general concern about the rise of Chinese AI, particularly DeepSeek, which has caused market volatility and scrutiny of Big Tech's AI investments. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, especially if its AI strategy is perceived as lagging. The fact that Nvidia had to address its tumbling stock due to DeepSeek's advance suggests a real competitive threat. However, the article also mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction will depend on those results. Meta's positive reaction to its earnings beat, driven by AI investments, suggests that strong earnings and a clear AI strategy could boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment seems cautious due to DeepSeek, but a strong earnings report from Apple could offset this concern. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general market unease, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI and its impact on the tech sector, with Apple (AAPL) positioned as a significant player.  However, the article also notes that Apple's recent integration of AI into its products, while generating record revenue, hasn't resulted in a significant sales boost for the iPhone 16.  This suggests that the market's immediate reaction to Apple's AI initiatives might be muted.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only 6th on Coatue's list of most important AI stocks further tempers expectations of a dramatic price surge. While the long-term prospects for Apple in the AI space are positive, the short-term impact of this specific news is likely to be less pronounced. The overall market sentiment towards AI is bullish, which could provide some support to AAPL, but the lack of immediate, substantial financial gains from Apple's AI integration suggests a more moderate price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth projections typically lead to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock, which drives the price up. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price rose 3.4% in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. The company's executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, indicating a recovery from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features. This positive forecast and the subsequent rise in premarket trading suggest a favorable short-term outlook for the stock. However, the broader market's reaction to the upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions could influence the stock's movement. Given the positive premarket performance and forecast, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where artificial intelligence features have been rolled out, which is a positive sign for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features has also had a negative impact. Considering the overall positive impact of AI on sales, it's likely that the stock price will rise, but the limited rollout might temper the increase. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns about Apple's struggle to innovate in AI, coupled with a downgrade from Oppenheimer and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors indicate negative sentiment towards the company's future growth prospects, particularly in AI, which could lead to a decline in investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised concerns about competition and market dynamics. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative, particularly after the impact on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. Although there are mixed signals regarding Apple's upcoming earnings, the prevailing market sentiment is cautious, suggesting a higher probability of a price decline. However, if Apple's earnings report exceeds expectations, there could be a positive reaction. Given the current environment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news paints a mixed picture for Apple. The rise of DeepSeek and its potential impact on the tech industry, coupled with Microsoft's Azure growth disappointment, creates a negative backdrop. However, Meta's positive earnings driven by AI investments offer a counterpoint. The article specifically mentions Apple's upcoming earnings, making them a crucial factor. Given the overall uncertainty and the potential for DeepSeek to negatively impact sentiment, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but a strong earnings report could easily reverse this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While the overall AI market sentiment is bullish, and Apple is integrating AI into its products, the impact on Apple's recent product sales hasn't been dramatic.  Apple's ranking as only 6th on Coatue's list of important AI stocks suggests that the market doesn't view Apple as a leading AI innovator at this time.  The record revenue is positive, but the lack of a significant sales boost from AI features introduces uncertainty.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to the overall positive AI sentiment and Apple's strong financial performance, while others predict a fall due to concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for the market to be overestimating the impact of AI.  I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's strong financial position, but the lack of a clear AI-driven sales boost tempers this optimism.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. This positive earnings surprise and strong growth projections typically lead to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock, which drives the price up. Previous predictions from models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct also support a higher probability of the stock price rising, citing positive earnings and AI-driven sales growth. While some models like qwen/qwen-turbo and openai/gpt-4o-mini had more negative outlooks, the majority of the recent predictions and the actual news content suggest a bullish sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast and its potential to recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features. This positive outlook, combined with the company's reassuring guidance on revenue growth, has driven its stock price up in premarket trading. The overall market sentiment seems cautious due to the upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, but Apple's recent performance and forecast suggest a favorable short-term outlook for its stock. Considering the mixed market environment and the potential for negative sentiment to affect tech stocks, there is still a possibility of a decline, but the current trend and forecasts indicate a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where artificial intelligence features have been rolled out, which is a positive sign for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features has also had a negative impact. Considering the overall positive impact of AI on sales, it's likely that the stock price will rise. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism towards Apple's stock, with some models assigning a high probability of the stock price rising due to positive earnings and strong growth projections. Given the positive news and the trend of increasing optimism, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's struggle to innovate in AI, including a recent downgrade from Oppenheimer and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors contribute to negative sentiment towards the company's future growth prospects, particularly in AI. Additionally, the disputes and uncertainties surrounding the Stargate initiative add to the negative sentiment. Despite some positive signals from other AI stocks and Apple's own earnings forecast, the overall tone of the news and previous predictions suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. While there are concerns about the competitive threat posed by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has contributed to a broader tech stock sell-off, there are also positive indicators regarding Apple's upcoming earnings report. The market's reaction will largely depend on the earnings results, which could either mitigate or exacerbate the negative sentiment. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to strong sales forecasts and AI integration, while others highlight the potential for a decline due to market volatility and competition. Given the cautious sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek as a competitor in the AI space has created market uncertainty and negatively impacted other tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to investor caution regarding Apple, especially given the scrutiny of Big Tech's AI investments. However, Meta's positive earnings, driven by AI investments, suggest that a strong earnings report and a clear AI strategy could boost Apple's stock. The article specifically mentions Apple's upcoming earnings, making them a crucial factor. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to the overall positive AI sentiment and Apple's strong financial performance, while others predict a fall due to concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for the market to be overestimating the impact of AI. Given the mixed signals and the importance of the upcoming earnings report, I am assigning a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but a strong earnings report could easily reverse this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While the overall AI market sentiment is positive and Apple is integrating AI, the impact on recent product sales hasn't been dramatic.  Apple's ranking 6th on Coatue's list of important AI stocks suggests it's not seen as a leading AI innovator. Record revenue is positive, but the lack of a significant AI-driven sales boost introduces uncertainty.  Previous predictions show a wide range, highlighting uncertainty.  The positive overall AI market sentiment and Apple's strong financial position suggest a potential price rise, but the lack of a clear AI sales boost tempers this.  The concern about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for overestimation of AI's impact are counterpoints. Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the lack of a clear AI-driven sales boost and the cautious sentiment in the market regarding Apple's AI strategy.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth.
