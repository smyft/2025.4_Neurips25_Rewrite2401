(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks triggered by the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised concerns about competition and market dynamics. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to cautious trading around Apple's stock, especially if the earnings report does not meet expectations. Given the current market environment and the potential for negative sentiment to affect Apple's stock, there is a higher probability of a price decline than an increase.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, there's general concern about the rise of Chinese AI, particularly DeepSeek, which has caused market volatility and scrutiny of Big Tech's AI investments. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, especially if its AI strategy is perceived as lagging. The fact that Nvidia had to address its tumbling stock due to DeepSeek's advance suggests a real competitive threat. However, the article also mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction will depend on those results. Meta's positive reaction to its earnings beat, driven by AI investments, suggests that strong earnings and a clear AI strategy could boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment seems cautious due to DeepSeek, but a strong earnings report from Apple could offset this concern. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general market unease, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news article highlights the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI and its impact on the tech sector, with Apple (AAPL) positioned as a significant player.  However, the article also notes that Apple's recent integration of AI into its products, while generating record revenue, hasn't resulted in a significant sales boost for the iPhone 16.  This suggests that the market's immediate reaction to Apple's AI initiatives might be muted.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only 6th on Coatue's list of most important AI stocks further tempers expectations of a dramatic price surge. While the long-term prospects for Apple in the AI space are positive, the short-term impact of this specific news is likely to be less pronounced. The overall market sentiment towards AI is bullish, which could provide some support to AAPL, but the lack of immediate, substantial financial gains from Apple's AI integration suggests a more moderate price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.85, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.15, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. Positive earnings surprises and strong growth projections typically lead to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock, which drives the price up. Given this information, the probability of the stock price rising is high, while the probability of it falling is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price rose 3.4% in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. The company's executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, indicating a recovery from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features. This positive forecast and the subsequent rise in premarket trading suggest a favorable short-term outlook for the stock. However, the broader market's reaction to the upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions could influence the stock's movement. Given the positive premarket performance and forecast, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where artificial intelligence features have been rolled out, which is a positive sign for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features has also had a negative impact. Considering the overall positive impact of AI on sales, it's likely that the stock price will rise, but the limited rollout might temper the increase. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights concerns about Apple's struggle to innovate in AI, coupled with a downgrade from Oppenheimer and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors indicate negative sentiment towards the company's future growth prospects, particularly in AI, which could lead to a decline in investor confidence.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a significant sell-off in tech stocks due to the emergence of the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has raised concerns about competition and market dynamics. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative, particularly after the impact on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. Although there are mixed signals regarding Apple's upcoming earnings, the prevailing market sentiment is cautious, suggesting a higher probability of a price decline. However, if Apple's earnings report exceeds expectations, there could be a positive reaction. Given the current environment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news paints a mixed picture for Apple. The rise of DeepSeek and its potential impact on the tech industry, coupled with Microsoft's Azure growth disappointment, creates a negative backdrop. However, Meta's positive earnings driven by AI investments offer a counterpoint. The article specifically mentions Apple's upcoming earnings, making them a crucial factor. Given the overall uncertainty and the potential for DeepSeek to negatively impact sentiment, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but a strong earnings report could easily reverse this.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is mixed. While the overall AI market sentiment is bullish, and Apple is integrating AI into its products, the impact on Apple's recent product sales hasn't been dramatic.  Apple's ranking as only 6th on Coatue's list of important AI stocks suggests that the market doesn't view Apple as a leading AI innovator at this time.  The record revenue is positive, but the lack of a significant sales boost from AI features introduces uncertainty.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to the overall positive AI sentiment and Apple's strong financial performance, while others predict a fall due to concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for the market to be overestimating the impact of AI.  I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's strong financial position, but the lack of a clear AI-driven sales boost tempers this optimism.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement based on this news alone.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock rose after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and provided guidance for solid growth. This positive earnings surprise and strong growth projections typically lead to increased investor confidence and demand for the stock, which drives the price up. Previous predictions from models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct also support a higher probability of the stock price rising, citing positive earnings and AI-driven sales growth. While some models like qwen/qwen-turbo and openai/gpt-4o-mini had more negative outlooks, the majority of the recent predictions and the actual news content suggest a bullish sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's strong sales growth forecast and its potential to recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features. This positive outlook, combined with the company's reassuring guidance on revenue growth, has driven its stock price up in premarket trading. The overall market sentiment seems cautious due to the upcoming inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy decisions, but Apple's recent performance and forecast suggest a favorable short-term outlook for its stock. Considering the mixed market environment and the potential for negative sentiment to affect tech stocks, there is still a possibility of a decline, but the current trend and forecasts indicate a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple iPhone sales have increased in markets where artificial intelligence features have been rolled out, which is a positive sign for the company. However, the limited rollout of these features has also had a negative impact. Considering the overall positive impact of AI on sales, it's likely that the stock price will rise. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism towards Apple's stock, with some models assigning a high probability of the stock price rising due to positive earnings and strong growth projections. Given the positive news and the trend of increasing optimism, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple's struggle to innovate in AI, including a recent downgrade from Oppenheimer and challenges in the Chinese market. These factors contribute to negative sentiment towards the company's future growth prospects, particularly in AI. Additionally, the disputes and uncertainties surrounding the Stargate initiative add to the negative sentiment. Despite some positive signals from other AI stocks and Apple's own earnings forecast, the overall tone of the news and previous predictions suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news surrounding Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. While there are concerns about the competitive threat posed by the Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has contributed to a broader tech stock sell-off, there are also positive indicators regarding Apple's upcoming earnings report. The market's reaction will largely depend on the earnings results, which could either mitigate or exacerbate the negative sentiment. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to strong sales forecasts and AI integration, while others highlight the potential for a decline due to market volatility and competition. Given the cautious sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek as a competitor in the AI space has created market uncertainty and negatively impacted other tech giants like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to investor caution regarding Apple, especially given the scrutiny of Big Tech's AI investments. However, Meta's positive earnings, driven by AI investments, suggest that a strong earnings report and a clear AI strategy could boost Apple's stock.
