(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple due to its strategic pivot towards following AI trends rather than leading them, which could erode its premium market positioning. Additionally, the concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a major holding, raises concerns about the ETF's performance in 2025. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of stock price decline as investors may react negatively to the perceived risks and valuation concerns surrounding Apple and its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the general tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek and Microsoft's Azure growth concerns create a negative sentiment. The scrutiny on AI spending and DeepSeek's competitive AI model could also negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI strategy. On the other hand, the article mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction to those earnings will likely be the biggest driver of short-term price movement. Meta's positive earnings, driven by AI investments, could create a positive halo effect, but this is less likely given the concerns about DeepSeek. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general negative sentiment in the tech sector, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news of Apple canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is generally negative for Apple's stock. While the Vision Pro remains a product in their lineup, the cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space.  The failure of N107, following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro, suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this technology.  This could lead to investor concern about Apple's future growth prospects in a potentially lucrative but challenging market. However, the news is not entirely catastrophic. Apple is still investing in AR/VR technology and has other projects underway.  The stock price reaction will likely be muted, with a slight downward pressure due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but not a significant crash given Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio. The impact is likely to be less severe than if this were Apple's primary focus area.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's integration of AI into its devices, emphasizing personal privacy and on-device processing, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors. Apple's recent financial performance shows a 6% revenue increase, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strong brand and financials outweigh the concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). It highlights that Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in Apple, valued at $69.9 billion as of Q3 2024. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, with a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Bank of America (BofA) analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, which could drive Apple's fiscal Q1 2025 results. However, they also expect lower iPhone shipments in the March quarter. Despite this, BofA reiterates its Buy rating for Apple, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. Overall, the news is neutral to positive, as it emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple and the company's solid financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, an analyst from Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removed its $250 price target, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation. This downgrade, combined with the perceived struggles in AI innovation, may lead to a decrease in investor confidence and subsequently, a fall in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that the article also mentions that Apple ranks 2nd on the list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings, which could indicate some level of confidence in the company's potential. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the article seems to be more negative than positive, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's forecast for the current quarter shows a low to mid-single digit revenue growth, which aligns with analyst expectations and helps to soothe investor concerns. Despite mixed holiday results, including declines in China and iPhone sales, the overall revenue and profit beat estimates. The positive reaction in late trading indicates confidence in future performance. However, challenges remain in markets like China and in competing with rivals in AI technology.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several challenges for Apple, particularly its strategic shift towards following AI trends rather than leading them, which could undermine its premium market position. The concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a major holding, raises concerns about the ETF's performance in 2025. Additionally, the elevated valuations of key competitors like Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's recent strategic decisions, suggest a more cautious outlook. While there are some positive aspects, such as Apple's strong financials and potential long-term growth in AI, the immediate sentiment appears more negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The initial tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek and concerns about Microsoft's Azure growth create a negative backdrop. However, Meta's positive earnings driven by AI investments offer a potential positive counterforce. The article explicitly mentions Apple's upcoming earnings, which will be a key factor influencing the stock price. The DeepSeek situation introduces uncertainty about AI competition and national security concerns, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the importance of the upcoming earnings report, I lean slightly towards a negative outlook, but the earnings could easily swing the sentiment. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with a slight trend towards negative sentiment in the later rounds. Given the uncertainty and the potential negative impact of the DeepSeek situation, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its AR glasses project (N107) is predominantly negative, but the impact is likely to be muted due to Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio.  The cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space, adding to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro.  This suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this specific technology. However, the news isn't catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects underway.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of this news.  While some models highlight the negative aspects (e.g.,  failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification as mitigating factors. Considering the mixed signals and the fact that this is one project among many, a significant stock price movement in either direction is less likely.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to integrate AI into its devices with a focus on personal privacy, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors. The company reported a 6% revenue increase in the September 2024 quarter, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to perceived risks and valuation concerns, while others see potential in Apple's strong brand and financials. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the uncertainty around AI's immediate impact tempers the optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights Berkshire Hathaway's significant stake in the company, valued at $69.9 billion as of Q3 2024. It also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, with a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Bank of America analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, which could drive Apple's fiscal Q1 5 results. However, they also expect lower iPhone shipments in the March quarter. Despite this, BofA reiterates its Buy rating for Apple, citing 'margin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.' The mixed signals from the news, including both positive and negative factors, suggest a relatively balanced outlook. However, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly positive due to Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple and the company's solid financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's struggles to innovate in AI, which could negatively impact its stock price. An analyst from Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removed its $250 price target, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation. However, the article also mentions that Apple ranks 2nd on the list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings, indicating some level of confidence in the company's potential. Considering the mixed sentiment and the overall tone of the article, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous predictions from other models also show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Taking into account the negative sentiment and the downgrade from Oppenheimer, I lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a mixed set of results for Apple Inc., featuring declines in China and iPhone sales, which have raised concerns among investors. However, Apple's forecast for the current quarter shows a low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, which aligns with analyst expectations and helps to soothe investor concerns. The stock price reacted positively in late trading, suggesting some confidence in future performance despite the challenges. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, weighing both the positive forecast and the current mixed results.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
