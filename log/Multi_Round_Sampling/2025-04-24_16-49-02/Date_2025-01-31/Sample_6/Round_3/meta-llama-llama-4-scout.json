(AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple due to its strategic pivot towards following AI trends rather than leading them, which could erode its premium market positioning. Additionally, the concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a major holding, raises concerns about the ETF's performance in 2025. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of stock price decline as investors may react negatively to the perceived risks and valuation concerns surrounding Apple and its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the general tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek and Microsoft's Azure growth concerns create a negative sentiment. The scrutiny on AI spending and DeepSeek's competitive AI model could also negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI strategy. On the other hand, the article mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction to those earnings will likely be the biggest driver of short-term price movement. Meta's positive earnings, driven by AI investments, could create a positive halo effect, but this is less likely given the concerns about DeepSeek. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general negative sentiment in the tech sector, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news of Apple canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is generally negative for Apple's stock. While the Vision Pro remains a product in their lineup, the cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space.  The failure of N107, following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro, suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this technology.  This could lead to investor concern about Apple's future growth prospects in a potentially lucrative but challenging market. However, the news is not entirely catastrophic. Apple is still investing in AR/VR technology and has other projects underway.  The stock price reaction will likely be muted, with a slight downward pressure due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but not a significant crash given Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio. The impact is likely to be less severe than if this were Apple's primary focus area.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's integration of AI into its devices, emphasizing personal privacy and on-device processing, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors. Apple's recent financial performance shows a 6% revenue increase, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strong brand and financials outweigh the concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). It highlights that Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in Apple, valued at $69.9 billion as of Q3 2024. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, with a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Bank of America (BofA) analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, which could drive Apple's fiscal Q1 2025 results. However, they also expect lower iPhone shipments in the March quarter. Despite this, BofA reiterates its Buy rating for Apple, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. Overall, the news is neutral to positive, as it emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple and the company's solid financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, an analyst from Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removed its $250 price target, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation. This downgrade, combined with the perceived struggles in AI innovation, may lead to a decrease in investor confidence and subsequently, a fall in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that the article also mentions that Apple ranks 2nd on the list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings, which could indicate some level of confidence in the company's potential. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the article seems to be more negative than positive, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's forecast for the current quarter shows a low to mid-single digit revenue growth, which aligns with analyst expectations and helps to soothe investor concerns. Despite mixed holiday results, including declines in China and iPhone sales, the overall revenue and profit beat estimates. The positive reaction in late trading indicates confidence in future performance. However, challenges remain in markets like China and in competing with rivals in AI technology.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several challenges for Apple, particularly its strategic shift towards following AI trends rather than leading them, which could undermine its premium market position. The concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a major holding, raises concerns about the ETF's performance in 2025. Additionally, the elevated valuations of key competitors like Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's recent strategic decisions, suggest a more cautious outlook. While there are some positive aspects, such as Apple's strong financials and potential long-term growth in AI, the immediate sentiment appears more negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The initial tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek and concerns about Microsoft's Azure growth create a negative backdrop. However, Meta's positive earnings driven by AI investments offer a potential positive counterforce. The article explicitly mentions Apple's upcoming earnings, which will be a key factor influencing the stock price. The DeepSeek situation introduces uncertainty about AI competition and national security concerns, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the importance of the upcoming earnings report, I lean slightly towards a negative outlook, but the earnings could easily swing the sentiment. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with a slight trend towards negative sentiment in the later rounds. Given the uncertainty and the potential negative impact of the DeepSeek situation, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its AR glasses project (N107) is predominantly negative, but the impact is likely to be muted due to Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio.  The cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space, adding to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro.  This suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this specific technology. However, the news isn't catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects underway.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of this news.  While some models highlight the negative aspects (e.g.,  failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification as mitigating factors. Considering the mixed signals and the fact that this is one project among many, a significant stock price movement in either direction is less likely.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to integrate AI into its devices with a focus on personal privacy, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors. The company reported a 6% revenue increase in the September 2024 quarter, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to perceived risks and valuation concerns, while others see potential in Apple's strong brand and financials. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the uncertainty around AI's immediate impact tempers the optimism.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights Berkshire Hathaway's significant stake in the company, valued at $69.9 billion as of Q3 2024. It also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, with a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Bank of America analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, which could drive Apple's fiscal Q1 5 results. However, they also expect lower iPhone shipments in the March quarter. Despite this, BofA reiterates its Buy rating for Apple, citing 'margin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.' The mixed signals from the news, including both positive and negative factors, suggest a relatively balanced outlook. However, the overall sentiment seems to lean slightly positive due to Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple and the company's solid financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's struggles to innovate in AI, which could negatively impact its stock price. An analyst from Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removed its $250 price target, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation. However, the article also mentions that Apple ranks 2nd on the list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings, indicating some level of confidence in the company's potential. Considering the mixed sentiment and the overall tone of the article, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. The previous predictions from other models also show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Taking into account the negative sentiment and the downgrade from Oppenheimer, I lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a mixed set of results for Apple Inc., featuring declines in China and iPhone sales, which have raised concerns among investors. However, Apple's forecast for the current quarter shows a low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, which aligns with analyst expectations and helps to soothe investor concerns. The stock price reacted positively in late trading, suggesting some confidence in future performance despite the challenges. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, weighing both the positive forecast and the current mixed results.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting both challenges and opportunities. Concerns about Apple's strategic pivot towards following AI trends rather than leading them, along with the elevated valuations of its major competitors, suggest a cautious sentiment among investors. Additionally, the concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a significant holding, raises further concerns about potential underperformance. While there are positive aspects, such as Apple's strong financials and the potential for long-term growth in AI, the immediate sentiment appears more negative. This leads to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news focuses on the broader tech landscape, particularly the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, on the market. While Apple's earnings are mentioned as upcoming, the primary concerns revolve around AI competition and potential national security implications. Microsoft's Azure growth concerns and Meta's AI-driven positive earnings create a mixed backdrop. The previous rounds show a trend towards negative sentiment, likely due to the uncertainty surrounding AI competition and Apple's strategic positioning. Given the mixed signals and the importance of the upcoming earnings report, I lean towards a slightly negative outlook, but the earnings could easily swing the sentiment. The DeepSeek situation introduces uncertainty about AI competition and national security concerns, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Therefore, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its AR glasses project (N107) is negative, but the impact is likely to be muted due to Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio.

Some models highlight negative aspects (failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), while others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification.  The fact that this is one project among many suggests a significant stock price movement in either direction is unlikely.  Considering the mixed signals and the relatively small scale of this setback compared to Apple's overall business, a slight downward pressure is more probable than a significant rise. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly negative outlook, which I'm incorporating into my prediction.  However, the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's integration of AI into its devices with a focus on personal privacy, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors.
