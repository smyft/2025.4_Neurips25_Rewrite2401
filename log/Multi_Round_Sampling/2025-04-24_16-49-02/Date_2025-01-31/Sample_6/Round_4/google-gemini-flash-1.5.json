(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple due to its strategic pivot towards following AI trends rather than leading them, which could erode its premium market positioning. Additionally, the concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a major holding, raises concerns about the ETF's performance in 2025. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of stock price decline as investors may react negatively to the perceived risks and valuation concerns surrounding Apple and its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the general tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek and Microsoft's Azure growth concerns create a negative sentiment. The scrutiny on AI spending and DeepSeek's competitive AI model could also negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI strategy. On the other hand, the article mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction to those earnings will likely be the biggest driver of short-term price movement. Meta's positive earnings, driven by AI investments, could create a positive halo effect, but this is less likely given the concerns about DeepSeek. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general negative sentiment in the tech sector, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news of Apple canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is generally negative for Apple's stock. While the Vision Pro remains a product in their lineup, the cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space.  The failure of N107, following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro, suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this technology.  This could lead to investor concern about Apple's future growth prospects in a potentially lucrative but challenging market. However, the news is not entirely catastrophic. Apple is still investing in AR/VR technology and has other projects underway.  The stock price reaction will likely be muted, with a slight downward pressure due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but not a significant crash given Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio. The impact is likely to be less severe than if this were Apple's primary focus area.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's integration of AI into its devices, emphasizing personal privacy and on-device processing, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors. Apple's recent financial performance shows a 6% revenue increase, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strong brand and financials outweigh the concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). It highlights that Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in Apple, valued at $69.9 billion as of Q3 2024. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, with a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Bank of America (BofA) analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, which could drive Apple's fiscal Q1 2025 results. However, they also expect lower iPhone shipments in the March quarter. Despite this, BofA reiterates its Buy rating for Apple, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. Overall, the news is neutral to positive, as it emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple and the company's solid financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, an analyst from Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removed its $250 price target, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation. This downgrade, combined with the perceived struggles in AI innovation, may lead to a decrease in investor confidence and subsequently, a fall in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that the article also mentions that Apple ranks 2nd on the list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings, which could indicate some level of confidence in the company's potential. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the article seems to be more negative than positive, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's forecast for the current quarter shows a low to mid-single digit revenue growth, which aligns with analyst expectations and helps to soothe investor concerns. Despite mixed holiday results, including declines in China and iPhone sales, the overall revenue and profit beat estimates. The positive reaction in late trading indicates confidence in future performance. However, challenges remain in markets like China and in competing with rivals in AI technology.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights several challenges for Apple, particularly its strategic shift towards following AI trends rather than leading them, which could undermine its premium market position. The concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a major holding, raises concerns about the ETF's performance in 2025. Additionally, the elevated valuations of key competitors like Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's recent strategic decisions, suggest a more cautious outlook. While there are some positive aspects, such as Apple's strong financials and potential long-term growth in AI, the immediate sentiment appears more negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The initial tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek and concerns about Microsoft's Azure growth create a negative backdrop. However, Meta's positive earnings driven by AI investments offer a potential positive counterforce. The article explicitly mentions Apple's upcoming earnings, which will be a key factor influencing the stock price. The DeepSeek situation introduces uncertainty about AI competition and national security concerns, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the importance of the upcoming earnings report, I lean slightly towards a negative outlook, but the earnings could easily swing the sentiment. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with a slight trend towards negative sentiment in the later rounds. Given the uncertainty and the potential negative impact of the DeepSeek situation, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news about Apple canceling its AR glasses project (N107) is predominantly negative, but the impact is likely to be muted due to Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of this news.  While some models highlight the negative aspects (e.g.,  failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification as mitigating factors. Considering the mixed signals and the fact that this is one project among many, a significant stock price movement in either direction is less likely.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's strategic move to integrate AI into its devices with a focus on personal privacy, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors.

Considering the mixed sentiment and the overall tone of the article, as well as the previous predictions from other models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed results for Apple Inc., including declines in China and iPhone sales, which has raised concerns among investors. However, the company's forecast for the current quarter showed a low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, aligning with analyst expectations and helping to soothe investor concerns. The stock price reacted positively in late trading, which suggests some confidence in future performance. Despite the challenges, the overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic due to the positive forecast and the strong financial performance, including record revenue and profit. The recent rounds of predictions from various models also indicate a mix of sentiments, but with a slight trend towards a positive outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space, adding to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro. This suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this specific technology. However, it's not catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects underway. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact. Some models highlight negative aspects (failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), while others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification. The fact that this is one project among many suggests a significant stock price movement in either direction is unlikely. Considering the mixed signals and the relatively small scale of this setback compared to Apple's overall business, a slight downward pressure is more probable than a significant rise.  The consistent trend across multiple prediction rounds leans towards a slightly negative outlook. However, the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term. The fact that this is a relatively niche product failure within a larger, successful company mitigates the negative impact.  The overall trend in predictions shows a slight bias towards a price fall, but the magnitude of the predicted fall is consistently small.  I'm weighting this information heavily, as the repeated predictions suggest a consensus view.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.38,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.62\n}\n```\n"
