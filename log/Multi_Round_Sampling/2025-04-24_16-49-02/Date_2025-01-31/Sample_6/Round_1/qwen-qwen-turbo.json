(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights potential challenges for Apple due to its strategic pivot towards following AI trends rather than leading them, which could erode its premium market positioning. Additionally, the concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a major holding, raises concerns about the ETF's performance in 2025. Given these factors, there is a higher likelihood of stock price decline as investors may react negatively to the perceived risks and valuation concerns surrounding Apple and its peers.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the general tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek and Microsoft's Azure growth concerns create a negative sentiment. The scrutiny on AI spending and DeepSeek's competitive AI model could also negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI strategy. On the other hand, the article mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction to those earnings will likely be the biggest driver of short-term price movement. Meta's positive earnings, driven by AI investments, could create a positive halo effect, but this is less likely given the concerns about DeepSeek. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general negative sentiment in the tech sector, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news of Apple canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is generally negative for Apple's stock. While the Vision Pro remains a product in their lineup, the cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space.  The failure of N107, following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro, suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this technology.  This could lead to investor concern about Apple's future growth prospects in a potentially lucrative but challenging market. However, the news is not entirely catastrophic. Apple is still investing in AR/VR technology and has other projects underway.  The stock price reaction will likely be muted, with a slight downward pressure due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but not a significant crash given Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio. The impact is likely to be less severe than if this were Apple's primary focus area.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's integration of AI into its devices, emphasizing personal privacy and on-device processing, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors. Apple's recent financial performance shows a 6% revenue increase, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Overall, the positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strong brand and financials outweigh the concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). It highlights that Berkshire Hathaway has a significant stake in Apple, valued at $69.9 billion as of Q3 2024. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, with a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Additionally, Bank of America (BofA) analysts predict strong initial demand for the iPhone 16, which could drive Apple's fiscal Q1 2025 results. However, they also expect lower iPhone shipments in the March quarter. Despite this, BofA reiterates its Buy rating for Apple, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow. Overall, the news is neutral to positive, as it emphasizes Warren Buffett's long-term confidence in Apple and the company's solid financials.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which could negatively impact its stock price. Additionally, an analyst from Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to 'Perform' from 'Outperform' and removed its $250 price target, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and a lack of AI innovation. This downgrade, combined with the perceived struggles in AI innovation, may lead to a decrease in investor confidence and subsequently, a fall in the stock price. However, it's worth noting that the article also mentions that Apple ranks 2nd on the list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings, which could indicate some level of confidence in the company's potential. Nevertheless, the overall tone of the article seems to be more negative than positive, leading to a higher estimated probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: Apple's forecast for the current quarter shows a low to mid-single digit revenue growth, which aligns with analyst expectations and helps to soothe investor concerns. Despite mixed holiday results, including declines in China and iPhone sales, the overall revenue and profit beat estimates. The positive reaction in late trading indicates confidence in future performance. However, challenges remain in markets like China and in competing with rivals in AI technology.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
