(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple lifts US stock index futures as crucial inflation test looms\nNews Content: (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which is a critical area for growth in the tech sector. The downgrade from Oppenheimer, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, adds to the negative sentiment. The lack of generative AI applications and a slower iPhone replacement cycle further suggest that Apple may face difficulties in maintaining its premium valuation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about increased competition and potential cost efficiencies in AI development, which could indirectly benefit Apple. Tim Cook's comment suggests a positive view on innovation that drives efficiency. However, the article also mentions Apple's revenue being down 11% year-over-year in China, which is a significant negative factor. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the China revenue decline is a more immediate and direct concern than the potential long-term benefits of DeepSeek's innovations. The market's initial reaction (avoiding the DeepSeek sell-off) suggests some resilience, but the China issue is a persistent headwind.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations and showed positive net margin expansion, concerns remain regarding tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese rivals, and the potential impact of tariffs.  The article highlights the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the Mag 7 group, with strong earnings growth projections for 2025. However, the focus on AI investments by competitors and their uncertain monetization strategies could indirectly impact Apple's valuation relative to its peers.  The positive market reaction to Apple's earnings was described as a 'sigh of relief' rather than enthusiastic approval, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than a neutral probability, but the overall market sentiment and strong sector projections offer some support.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights DeepSeek's competitive AI models, which have caused a sell-off in global tech stocks, raising concerns about Big Tech's AI spending. However, the CEOs of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have responded optimistically, suggesting that innovation and efficiency driven by DeepSeek could benefit the industry. Apple's stock avoided the initial sell-off, and Tim Cook's comments reflect a positive outlook on innovation. However, Apple's declining revenue in China could be a counterbalancing factor. Overall, the market reaction seems mixed but leans slightly positive due to the optimistic tone from Big Tech leaders.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price rose in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. This suggests that investors are reassured by Apple's guidance, which forecasts revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the coming quarter. Given this positive reaction and the overall market sentiment, it is likely that Apple's stock price will continue to rise. However, the market is also awaiting key inflation data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and impact stock prices broadly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health and performance. This typically leads to an increase in investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in stock price. Given this information, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, with a notable highlight being the strong performance in its services revenue. Despite potential mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat on analyst estimates is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, which typically translates into a stock price rise.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
