(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Top Midday Stories: Apple Fiscal Q1 Results Beat Estimates; Walgreens Suspends Dividend Payments\nNews Content: The Nasdaq Composite was up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 was up around 0.6% as investors analyzed more\n\nPREMIUM\n\nUpgrade to read this MT Newswires article and get so much more.\n\nA Silver or Gold subscription plan is required to access premium news articles.\n\nUpgrade\n\nAlready have a subscription?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which is a critical area for growth in the tech sector. The downgrade from Oppenheimer, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, adds to the negative sentiment. The lack of generative AI applications and a slower iPhone replacement cycle further suggest that Apple may face difficulties in maintaining its premium valuation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about increased competition and potential cost efficiencies in AI development, which could indirectly benefit Apple. Tim Cook's comment suggests a positive view on innovation that drives efficiency. However, the article also mentions Apple's revenue being down 11% year-over-year in China, which is a significant negative factor. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the China revenue decline is a more immediate and direct concern than the potential long-term benefits of DeepSeek's innovations. The market's initial reaction (avoiding the DeepSeek sell-off) suggests some resilience, but the China issue is a persistent headwind.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations and showed positive net margin expansion, concerns remain regarding tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese rivals, and the potential impact of tariffs.  The article highlights the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the Mag 7 group, with strong earnings growth projections for 2025. However, the focus on AI investments by competitors and their uncertain monetization strategies could indirectly impact Apple's valuation relative to its peers.  The positive market reaction to Apple's earnings was described as a 'sigh of relief' rather than enthusiastic approval, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than a neutral probability, but the overall market sentiment and strong sector projections offer some support.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights DeepSeek's competitive AI models, which have caused a sell-off in global tech stocks, raising concerns about Big Tech's AI spending. However, the CEOs of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have responded optimistically, suggesting that innovation and efficiency driven by DeepSeek could benefit the industry. Apple's stock avoided the initial sell-off, and Tim Cook's comments reflect a positive outlook on innovation. However, Apple's declining revenue in China could be a counterbalancing factor. Overall, the market reaction seems mixed but leans slightly positive due to the optimistic tone from Big Tech leaders.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price rose in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. This suggests that investors are reassured by Apple's guidance, which forecasts revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the coming quarter. Given this positive reaction and the overall market sentiment, it is likely that Apple's stock price will continue to rise. However, the market is also awaiting key inflation data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and impact stock prices broadly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health and performance. This typically leads to an increase in investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in stock price. Given this information, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, with a notable highlight being the strong performance in its services revenue. Despite potential mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat on analyst estimates is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, which typically translates into a stock price rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which is a critical area for growth in the tech sector. The downgrade from Oppenheimer highlights a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, contributing to negative sentiment. The lack of generative AI applications and a slower iPhone replacement cycle further suggest difficulties in maintaining its premium valuation. While there are some mixed signals regarding competition and potential long-term benefits, the overall sentiment leans negative due to the immediate concerns raised in the news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential to drive efficiency in AI development could be seen as a positive for the industry, including Apple, the article also highlights Apple's declining revenue in China, which is a significant concern. Tim Cook's comments suggest a cautiously optimistic view on innovation. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some leaning towards a price decrease due to concerns about innovation and China revenue, while others are more optimistic. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, I will slightly lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q4 earnings beat expectations and showed positive net margin expansion, significant headwinds exist. Tepid iPhone demand in China, intensified competition from local rivals, and potential tariff impacts are major concerns.  The positive market reaction to Apple's earnings was characterized as a 'sigh of relief,' suggesting cautious optimism rather than strong confidence.  The emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on AI spending by competitors introduces uncertainty, although Apple's own AI struggles are also highlighted.  While the broader tech sector shows positive growth projections, Apple's specific challenges in China and AI weigh heavily. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions showing a range from 0.25 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the significant downside risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, DeepSeek's competitive AI models have sparked a broader discussion about innovation and efficiency in the tech sector, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook expressing optimism about such advancements. Apple's stock also avoided the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's announcement, indicating some resilience. However, Apple's significant revenue decline in China (down 11% year-over-year) is a notable negative factor. The market's reaction to the news appears mixed, with some models leaning slightly positive due to the optimistic tone from Big Tech leaders, while others highlight the immediate concerns in China. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall sentiment remains cautious.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price rose in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. This suggests that investors are reassured by Apple's guidance, which forecasts revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the coming quarter. The positive premarket trading of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by 3.4% and the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector, despite concerns about inflation data and global market trends, contribute to a favorable outlook for Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health and performance. This typically leads to an increase in investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a trend towards a positive outlook, with some models indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising. The overall market sentiment, as indicated by the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 being up, also supports a positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings beat analysts' estimates, particularly due to a jump in services revenue. This positive earnings report is likely to boost investor confidence and result in a stock price rise. Although there were concerns about mixed performance in certain segments and challenges in the Chinese market, the overall positive sentiment from various predictions and the market's typical reaction to beating estimates suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price increase.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which is a critical area for growth in the tech sector.

Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. DeepSeek's emergence and the optimistic responses from Big Tech CEOs like Tim Cook suggest potential benefits from increased efficiency and innovation in AI. However, Apple's declining revenue in China remains a significant concern. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty. Some models lean towards a price decrease due to concerns about innovation and China revenue, while others are more optimistic. Considering the mixed signals and the trend of previous predictions, I'm slightly adjusting towards a more neutral outlook, acknowledging both the potential benefits and the existing challenges. The fact that Apple avoided the initial DeepSeek sell-off is a positive sign, but the China issue is persistent.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While Q4 earnings beat expectations and net margins expanded, significant concerns remain.  Tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition, and potential tariffs pose substantial headwinds. The positive market reaction was described as a 'sigh of relief,' indicating cautious optimism rather than strong confidence.  The emergence of DeepSeek adds uncertainty regarding AI spending and competitive dynamics.  While the broader tech sector shows positive growth projections, Apple's specific challenges outweigh the general positive sentiment.  Analyzing the previous predictions, there's a wide range of probabilities for a price rise (0.25 to 0.8), reflecting the uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the significant downside risks, a slightly pessimistic outlook is warranted, but not overwhelmingly so. The overall market sentiment and strong sector projections offer some support, preventing an extremely negative prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

This typically leads to an increase in investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a trend towards a positive outlook, with some models indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising. The overall market sentiment, as indicated by the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 being up, also supports a positive outlook. However, some models also highlight concerns about mixed performance in certain segments and challenges in the Chinese market, which could negatively impact the stock price. Taking into account the positive earnings report, the trend of previous predictions, and the overall market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings beat analysts' estimates, particularly due to a jump in services revenue.

Previous predictions show a trend towards positivity, with multiple models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Despite some concerns about mixed performance in certain segments and challenges in the Chinese market, the overall positive sentiment from the latest earnings report and historical predictions strongly suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is facing significant challenges in the AI sector, which is critical for growth in the tech industry. The downgrade from Oppenheimer highlights a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and ongoing issues in the Chinese market, contributing to negative sentiment.

However, Apple's declining revenue in China remains a significant concern. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty. Some models lean towards a price decrease due to concerns about innovation and China revenue, while others are more optimistic.

The China revenue decline and the increasing competition in AI are significant headwinds, but the overall market sentiment and the potential for efficiency gains from DeepSeek's innovations offer some support. Given the slightly negative trend in the previous rounds, I will slightly decrease the probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.

Considering the mixed signals and the significant downside risks, a slightly pessimistic outlook is warranted, but not overwhelmingly so. The overall market sentiment and strong sector projections offer some support, preventing an extremely negative prediction.
