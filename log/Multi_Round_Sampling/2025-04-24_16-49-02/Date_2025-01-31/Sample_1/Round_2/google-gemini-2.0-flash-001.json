Here's what the CEOs of Apple, Meta and Microsoft are saying\nNews Content: The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which is a critical area for growth in the tech sector. The downgrade from Oppenheimer, citing a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, adds to the negative sentiment. The lack of generative AI applications and a slower iPhone replacement cycle further suggest that Apple may face difficulties in maintaining its premium valuation. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about increased competition and potential cost efficiencies in AI development, which could indirectly benefit Apple. Tim Cook's comment suggests a positive view on innovation that drives efficiency. However, the article also mentions Apple's revenue being down 11% year-over-year in China, which is a significant negative factor. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the China revenue decline is a more immediate and direct concern than the potential long-term benefits of DeepSeek's innovations. The market's initial reaction (avoiding the DeepSeek sell-off) suggests some resilience, but the China issue is a persistent headwind.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations and showed positive net margin expansion, concerns remain regarding tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition from local Chinese rivals, and the potential impact of tariffs.  The article highlights the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector and the Mag 7 group, with strong earnings growth projections for 2025. However, the focus on AI investments by competitors and their uncertain monetization strategies could indirectly impact Apple's valuation relative to its peers.  The positive market reaction to Apple's earnings was described as a 'sigh of relief' rather than enthusiastic approval, suggesting a cautious market sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than a neutral probability, but the overall market sentiment and strong sector projections offer some support.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights DeepSeek's competitive AI models, which have caused a sell-off in global tech stocks, raising concerns about Big Tech's AI spending. However, the CEOs of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have responded optimistically, suggesting that innovation and efficiency driven by DeepSeek could benefit the industry. Apple's stock avoided the initial sell-off, and Tim Cook's comments reflect a positive outlook on innovation. However, Apple's declining revenue in China could be a counterbalancing factor. Overall, the market reaction seems mixed but leans slightly positive due to the optimistic tone from Big Tech leaders.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price rose in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. This suggests that investors are reassured by Apple's guidance, which forecasts revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the coming quarter. Given this positive reaction and the overall market sentiment, it is likely that Apple's stock price will continue to rise. However, the market is also awaiting key inflation data, which could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions and impact stock prices broadly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health and performance. This typically leads to an increase in investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in stock price. Given this information, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: Apple Inc. (AAPL) reported better-than-expected earnings for its fiscal 2025 first quarter, with a notable highlight being the strong performance in its services revenue. Despite potential mixed performance in other segments, the overall beat on analyst estimates is likely to have a positive impact on investor sentiment, which typically translates into a stock price rise.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple Inc. is struggling to innovate in AI, which is a critical area for growth in the tech sector. The downgrade from Oppenheimer highlights a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, contributing to negative sentiment. The lack of generative AI applications and a slower iPhone replacement cycle further suggest difficulties in maintaining its premium valuation. While there are some mixed signals regarding competition and potential long-term benefits, the overall sentiment leans negative due to the immediate concerns raised in the news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the emergence of DeepSeek and its potential to drive efficiency in AI development could be seen as a positive for the industry, including Apple, the article also highlights Apple's declining revenue in China, which is a significant concern. Tim Cook's comments suggest a cautiously optimistic view on innovation. The previous predictions are quite varied, with some leaning towards a price decrease due to concerns about innovation and China revenue, while others are more optimistic. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, I will slightly lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q4 earnings beat expectations and showed positive net margin expansion, significant headwinds exist. Tepid iPhone demand in China, intensified competition from local rivals, and potential tariff impacts are major concerns.  The positive market reaction to Apple's earnings was characterized as a 'sigh of relief,' suggesting cautious optimism rather than strong confidence.  The emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on AI spending by competitors introduces uncertainty, although Apple's own AI struggles are also highlighted.  While the broader tech sector shows positive growth projections, Apple's specific challenges in China and AI weigh heavily. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions showing a range from 0.25 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the significant downside risks.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, DeepSeek's competitive AI models have sparked a broader discussion about innovation and efficiency in the tech sector, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook expressing optimism about such advancements. Apple's stock also avoided the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's announcement, indicating some resilience. However, Apple's significant revenue decline in China (down 11% year-over-year) is a notable negative factor. The market's reaction to the news appears mixed, with some models leaning slightly positive due to the optimistic tone from Big Tech leaders, while others highlight the immediate concerns in China. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall sentiment remains cautious.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price rose in premarket trading following a strong sales growth forecast. This suggests that investors are reassured by Apple's guidance, which forecasts revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits for the coming quarter. The positive premarket trading of Apple Inc. (AAPL) by 3.4% and the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector, despite concerns about inflation data and global market trends, contribute to a favorable outlook for Apple's stock price. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's fiscal Q1 results beat estimates, which is a positive indicator for the company's financial health and performance. This typically leads to an increase in investor confidence and, consequently, a rise in stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a trend towards a positive outlook, with some models indicating a higher probability of the stock price rising. The overall market sentiment, as indicated by the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 being up, also supports a positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple's Q1 earnings beat analysts' estimates, particularly due to a jump in services revenue. This positive earnings report is likely to boost investor confidence and result in a stock price rise. Although there were concerns about mixed performance in certain segments and challenges in the Chinese market, the overall positive sentiment from various predictions and the market's typical reaction to beating estimates suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price increase.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
