The headline seems to invite consideration rather than announce a specific event or financial result. Therefore, it's likely that the stock price will not experience a drastic change solely based on this headline. However, the nature of the question could imply a slightly positive outlook if interpreted as suggesting the stock might be a good buy, which could lead to a slight inclination towards the stock price rising. Given the neutral nature, I would estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to potential positive sentiment, but still keep it relatively balanced.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Should You Buy Apple Stock Right Now in 2025?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
