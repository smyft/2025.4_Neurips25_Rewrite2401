A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny for Big Tech may create uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement with Trump may lead to a higher probability of stock price rise, while the legal challenges could temper that optimism, leading to a lower probability of stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant positive or negative movement in Apple's stock price. While some investors might view it positively as a sign of potential collaboration with the new administration, others might view it negatively depending on their political views. The absence of Nvidia's CEO is also mentioned, but this is more relevant to Nvidia than Apple. Overall, the news is neutral and unlikely to have a strong impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is not directly relevant to Apple (AAPL). The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but there's no information connecting Apple's performance or stock price to this event. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this specific news is extremely low. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple Inc.'s CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. While the attendance of Big Tech CEOs at political events can sometimes signal favorable policies or regulatory environments, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. The market's reaction could be neutral or slightly positive if investors perceive this as a sign of potential favorable policies for Big Tech under the new administration. However, there is no explicit positive or negative news specific to Apple's business operations or financial performance in this report. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on a neutral to slightly positive interpretation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates the company's engagement with the administration. However, the article does not contain any specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price, such as new product announcements, financial results, or major business deals. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the neutral to positive perception of the CEO's attendance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of these CEOs may be perceived as a sign of cooperation and potential future collaborations between the tech industry and the new administration. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or financials that would directly impact its stock price. Given the neutral nature of the news, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is relatively balanced, but slightly leaning towards a rise due to the potential for positive relationships between the tech industry and the government.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses mistakes in investing and provides a general reflection on the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence. While it mentions Apple specifically, the overall tone is reflective and doesn't contain any direct negative news or catalysts that would significantly impact stock price. The positive aspects mentioned about Apple, such as its brand value and historical performance, suggest a stable position despite potential headwinds.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
