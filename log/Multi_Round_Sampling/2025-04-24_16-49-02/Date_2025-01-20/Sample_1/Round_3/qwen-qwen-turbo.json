(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny for Big Tech may create uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement with Trump may lead to a higher probability of stock price rise, while the legal challenges could temper that optimism, leading to a lower probability of stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant positive or negative movement in Apple's stock price. While some investors might view it positively as a sign of potential collaboration with the new administration, others might view it negatively depending on their political views. The absence of Nvidia's CEO is also mentioned, but this is more relevant to Nvidia than Apple. Overall, the news is neutral and unlikely to have a strong impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is not directly relevant to Apple (AAPL). The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but there's no information connecting Apple's performance or stock price to this event. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this specific news is extremely low. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of Apple Inc.'s CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. While the attendance of Big Tech CEOs at political events can sometimes signal favorable policies or regulatory environments, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. The market's reaction could be neutral or slightly positive if investors perceive this as a sign of potential favorable policies for Big Tech under the new administration. However, there is no explicit positive or negative news specific to Apple's business operations or financial performance in this report. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned based on a neutral to slightly positive interpretation.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates the company's engagement with the administration. However, the article does not contain any specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price, such as new product announcements, financial results, or major business deals. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the neutral to positive perception of the CEO's attendance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of these CEOs may be perceived as a sign of cooperation and potential future collaborations between the tech industry and the new administration. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or financials that would directly impact its stock price. Given the neutral nature of the news, the probability of the stock price rising or falling is relatively balanced, but slightly leaning towards a rise due to the potential for positive relationships between the tech industry and the government.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses mistakes in investing and provides a general reflection on the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence. While it mentions Apple specifically, the overall tone is reflective and doesn't contain any direct negative news or catalysts that would significantly impact stock price. The positive aspects mentioned about Apple, such as its brand value and historical performance, suggest a stable position despite potential headwinds.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny for Big Tech introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement with Trump may lead to a higher probability of stock price rise, while the legal challenges could temper that optimism. Considering the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news of Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration is generally neutral to slightly positive. It suggests a willingness to engage with the new administration, which could be seen as a positive sign for potential future collaborations or favorable policies. However, it's not a concrete event that directly impacts Apple's financials or operations. Considering the previous predictions, there's a general consensus that the news is either neutral or slightly positive. Some models predicted a 50/50 chance, while others leaned slightly towards a rise. Given this context, I'll slightly increase the probability of a rise, but not significantly, as the news itself is not a major catalyst.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Nvidia's CEO skipping Trump's inauguration, which is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  While the presence of other tech CEOs at the inauguration *might* be interpreted as either positive or negative depending on individual investor viewpoints and political leanings, the news itself provides no specific information about Apple's prospects.  The previous predictions range widely, reflecting this lack of direct impact.  Given the absence of any Apple-specific news, the most likely scenario is minimal price movement.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards neutrality, slightly favoring a neutral outcome due to the overall lack of significant information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports the attendance of Apple's CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. This could be perceived as a positive sign of potential cooperation between Apple and the new administration, which might lead to favorable policies or regulatory environments for the tech industry. However, the article does not provide any specific business or financial information that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Given the neutral to slightly positive nature of the news, and considering the previous predictions which leaned towards a balanced or slightly positive impact, the probabilities are assigned accordingly.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.525, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.475, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc.'s CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. This event may be perceived as a neutral to slightly positive sign for Apple's relationship with the new administration, but it does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or financial performance. Given the neutral nature of the news and the lack of direct impact on Apple's operations or financials, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. However, the slight inclination towards a positive impact due to potential cooperation and favorable regulatory environment for Big Tech under the new administration leads to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.525, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.475, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple's CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, which may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors. However, the article does not contain any specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a range of opinions, from a higher probability of a rise to a neutral assessment. Given the lack of direct impact on Apple's business or financials, the probabilities should be relatively balanced. However, the slight inclination towards a positive impact in some previous predictions suggests that investors might view the CEO's attendance as a sign of potential favorable policies for Big Tech under the new administration. Therefore, a balanced approach with a slight lean towards a positive impact seems reasonable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses personal reflections and common mistakes in investing, without providing concrete news specific to Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions Apple briefly in the context of reflecting on complacency in investment theses, but it does not present any new, specific information about the company's current financial status or immediate future outlook. Given the lack of actionable information about Apple and considering the general neutral tone of the article, the probabilities remain relatively balanced.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between Trump and Big Tech, including Apple.

Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from neutral to slightly positive. Considering the lack of direct impact and the range of previous opinions, I'll maintain a balanced approach, slightly leaning towards a positive impact due to the potential for favorable policies under the new administration.
