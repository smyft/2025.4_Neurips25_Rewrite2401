A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses common investing mistakes and reflects on the author's experience with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance, they also highlight concerns about complacency and the need for ongoing diligence in evaluating the company's performance. The overall tone suggests a cautious approach to investing in Apple, which may lead to a slight bearish sentiment among investors. However, the strong brand and historical growth potential still support a positive outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Apple's established market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant positive or negative movement in Apple's stock price. While some investors might view it positively as a sign of potential collaboration with the new administration, others might view it negatively depending on their political views. The absence of Nvidia's CEO is also mentioned, but this is more relevant to Nvidia than Apple. Overall, the news is neutral and unlikely to have a strong impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, one of which involves Apple.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and history but points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that complacency in holding the stock is a mistake.  However, the author doesn't predict a fall in Apple's stock price, only highlighting the need for continued diligence and reassessment of the investment thesis.  The overall tone is not negative towards Apple, but rather cautionary.  The mention of slower growth compared to other companies and the need for continued diligence suggests a slightly higher probability of stagnation or slower growth than a significant price drop. The article itself does not provide any information that would directly cause a stock price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline reports that Apple Inc.'s CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony alongside other Big Tech CEOs. While the presence of Apple's CEO at a political event may indicate potential engagement with the incoming administration, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Historically, such events do not typically cause significant immediate stock price movements unless they signal specific policy changes or business advantages/disadvantages for the company. Given the lack of concrete details in the news about policy implications or business outcomes, the market reaction is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to perceived political alignment. However, the probabilities remain modest as the news does not provide actionable financial or operational insights.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO is in attendance at Trump's Inauguration ceremony. This neutral piece of information about a company's CEO attending a political event does not inherently suggest a positive or negative impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards no significant change. However, for the purpose of estimation, I'll assign probabilities based on the perceived neutrality of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending his inauguration. This could be seen as a positive sign for Apple, as it may indicate a more favorable business environment. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could be a negative factor. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, but the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. The attendance of tech executives at the inauguration may be seen as a sign of cooperation and stability, which could lead to a slight increase in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a cautious outlook for Apple, pointing out concerns over iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the impact of the Chinese economy. His skepticism toward Apple having a good quarter and the mention of overvaluation contribute to a bearish sentiment. Additionally, the focus on AI stocks with potentially higher returns might shift investor attention away from AAPL.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article discusses the author's reflections on past investing mistakes, particularly regarding complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance, it also highlights concerns about the company's growth rate relative to competitors and the need for ongoing diligence in evaluating investments. This cautious tone suggests a slight bearish sentiment among investors, as complacency could lead to stagnation. However, the overall sentiment remains relatively balanced due to Apple's established market position and potential for future growth. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of it falling due to the concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Apple's CEO at Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant positive or negative movement in Apple's stock price. While some investors might view it positively as a sign of potential collaboration with the new administration, others might view it negatively depending on their political views. The absence of Nvidia's CEO is also mentioned, but this is more relevant to Nvidia than Apple. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight tendency towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to 50%, with a slight lean towards a rise due to the potential for perceived collaboration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example within a broader discussion.  The author expresses some caution regarding Apple's future growth, noting slower expansion compared to other companies and the risk of complacency. However, the overall tone isn't strongly bearish; the author still considers Apple a favorable investment.  The article lacks any specific negative news about Apple's financials or operations that would directly cause a stock price drop.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely, and the lack of concrete negative news in this article, I'm assigning probabilities that lean slightly towards a price rise, reflecting Apple's established position and the generally positive, albeit cautious, sentiment expressed in the article. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, indicating uncertainty in the market about Apple's near-term prospects.  My prediction attempts to balance the cautious tone of the article with Apple's overall strong market position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline reports that Apple Inc.'s CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony alongside other Big Tech CEOs.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, with some models predicting a slight inclination towards a price rise and others towards a fall or neutrality. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news and the balanced views from previous predictions, I estimate the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling to be close to equal, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the potential for a more favorable business environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc.

While it could signal potential collaboration, it doesn't guarantee any specific policy changes or business advantages. Previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning slightly positive and others neutral. However, one model consistently predicts a strong bearish sentiment based on Jim Cramer's commentary and concerns about iPhone sales and geopolitical factors. Considering the neutral nature of the inauguration news and the persistent bearish sentiment from one model, I'll slightly adjust my prediction towards a more balanced view, but still leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the existing concerns. The attendance itself is unlikely to cause a significant rise, and the pre-existing bearish sentiment could amplify any negative reactions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example within a broader discussion.  The author's reflection on their own investment in Apple highlights a past mistake of complacency, acknowledging Apple's strong brand and history but noting slower growth relative to competitors.  The author doesn't predict a fall in Apple's stock price, only highlighting the need for continued diligence and reassessment of the investment thesis. This cautious tone, while not explicitly bearish, suggests a lower probability of significant price increases.  The lack of specific negative news about Apple's financials or operations, combined with its established market position, prevents a prediction heavily weighted towards a price fall.  Considering the range of previous predictions (from 0.2 to 0.55 for a price rise), and the lack of concrete negative news in this article, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a slightly higher chance of stagnation or modest growth than a significant price movement in either direction. The overall sentiment is neutral to slightly bearish due to the emphasis on the need for continued vigilance and the acknowledgment of slower growth compared to peers.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline reports that Apple Inc.'s CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony alongside other Big Tech CEOs.

Given the lack of substantial positive or negative implications in the news, the market reaction is likely to be neutral. Previous predictions from other models also reflect a balanced view, with slight variations leaning towards neutrality or modest positivity. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a rise due to the potential for perceived political alignment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.51, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.49, Reasoning: The news headline reports that Apple's CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony alongside other Big Tech CEOs.
