(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The article discusses common investing mistakes and reflects on the author's experience with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance, they also highlight concerns about complacency and the need for ongoing diligence in evaluating the company's performance. The overall tone suggests a cautious approach to investing in Apple, which may lead to a slight bearish sentiment among investors. However, the strong brand and historical growth potential still support a positive outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Apple's established market position.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant positive or negative movement in Apple's stock price. While some investors might view it positively as a sign of potential collaboration with the new administration, others might view it negatively depending on their political views. The absence of Nvidia's CEO is also mentioned, but this is more relevant to Nvidia than Apple. Overall, the news is neutral and unlikely to have a strong impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to 50%.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, one of which involves Apple.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and history but points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that complacency in holding the stock is a mistake.  However, the author doesn't predict a fall in Apple's stock price, only highlighting the need for continued diligence and reassessment of the investment thesis.  The overall tone is not negative towards Apple, but rather cautionary.  The mention of slower growth compared to other companies and the need for continued diligence suggests a slightly higher probability of stagnation or slower growth than a significant price drop. The article itself does not provide any information that would directly cause a stock price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline reports that Apple Inc.'s CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony alongside other Big Tech CEOs. While the presence of Apple's CEO at a political event may indicate potential engagement with the incoming administration, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. Historically, such events do not typically cause significant immediate stock price movements unless they signal specific policy changes or business advantages/disadvantages for the company. Given the lack of concrete details in the news about policy implications or business outcomes, the market reaction is likely to be neutral or slightly positive due to perceived political alignment. However, the probabilities remain modest as the news does not provide actionable financial or operational insights.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO is in attendance at Trump's Inauguration ceremony. This neutral piece of information about a company's CEO attending a political event does not inherently suggest a positive or negative impact on the company's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards no significant change. However, for the purpose of estimation, I'll assign probabilities based on the perceived neutrality of the news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending his inauguration. This could be seen as a positive sign for Apple, as it may indicate a more favorable business environment. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could be a negative factor. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, but the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. The attendance of tech executives at the inauguration may be seen as a sign of cooperation and stability, which could lead to a slight increase in the stock price.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a cautious outlook for Apple, pointing out concerns over iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the impact of the Chinese economy. His skepticism toward Apple having a good quarter and the mention of overvaluation contribute to a bearish sentiment. Additionally, the focus on AI stocks with potentially higher returns might shift investor attention away from AAPL.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The article discusses the author's reflections on past investing mistakes, particularly regarding complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance, it also highlights concerns about the company's growth rate relative to competitors and the need for ongoing diligence in evaluating investments. This cautious tone suggests a slight bearish sentiment among investors, as complacency could lead to stagnation. However, the overall sentiment remains relatively balanced due to Apple's established market position and potential for future growth. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of it falling due to the concerns raised.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Apple's CEO at Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant positive or negative movement in Apple's stock price. While some investors might view it positively as a sign of potential collaboration with the new administration, others might view it negatively depending on their political views. The absence of Nvidia's CEO is also mentioned, but this is more relevant to Nvidia than Apple. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight tendency towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to 50%, with a slight lean towards a rise due to the potential for perceived collaboration.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example within a broader discussion.  The author expresses some caution regarding Apple's future growth, noting slower expansion compared to other companies and the risk of complacency. However, the overall tone isn't strongly bearish; the author still considers Apple a favorable investment.  The article lacks any specific negative news about Apple's financials or operations that would directly cause a stock price drop.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely, and the lack of concrete negative news in this article, I'm assigning probabilities that lean slightly towards a price rise, reflecting Apple's established position and the generally positive, albeit cautious, sentiment expressed in the article. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, indicating uncertainty in the market about Apple's near-term prospects.  My prediction attempts to balance the cautious tone of the article with Apple's overall strong market position.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news headline reports that Apple Inc.'s CEO attended President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony alongside other Big Tech CEOs.
