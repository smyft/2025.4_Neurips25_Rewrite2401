A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the presence of Apple CEO at a significant political event, which may be perceived positively by investors as it indicates a strong relationship between big tech and the government. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain as it depends on broader market reactions to the inauguration and any potential policy changes that may arise. Given the mixed sentiment surrounding political events, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the potential for volatility, leading to a lower probability of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least less negative, relationship between Apple and a future Trump administration. While past tensions existed, Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. The overall impact is likely slightly positive, as maintaining a good relationship with the government is generally beneficial for large corporations. The mention of potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms and general market news is less directly relevant to Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret this as positive (showing a willingness to cooperate with the administration), others might view it negatively (depending on their political leanings and perceptions of Trump's policies).  However, the news itself provides no specific information about potential policy changes affecting Apple or any indication of positive or negative impacts on the company's business. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-lived. The probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with market forces and other news likely to have a far greater impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip in China and Taiwan. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and does not provide any material information that would significantly impact AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that Apple's stock is a 'wildcard to the downside' and that he doesn't think Apple will have a good quarter. He also mentions that many analysts believe Apple could surprise to the downside, which could lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Additionally, Cramer notes that the stock had a spurt at the end of the year that seemed unwarranted and that both Apple and NVIDIA have been laggards since the year began. These comments are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and increase the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple. The attendance of major tech executives, such as Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship. This could potentially lead to a more favorable business environment for Apple. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the article, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential for improved relations with the administration, but also acknowledge the possibility of a decline due to regulatory risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at a significant political event, which may be interpreted positively by investors as it suggests a willingness to engage with the new administration. This could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple. However, there are mixed sentiments regarding the political landscape, and ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech could dampen investor enthusiasm. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a positive outlook due to potential improved relations with the government, while others express caution due to regulatory risks. Overall, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, balanced by the potential for volatility and negative sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration, signaling a potential effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. This could be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a stock price increase. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models see the event as neutral, while others lean slightly positive. The presence of Tim Cook at the inauguration is a tangible event that suggests a proactive approach by Apple to navigate the political landscape. Given this, I'll slightly increase the probability of a rise compared to a fall, but acknowledge the inherent uncertainty and potential for negative impacts from legal challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple.  While Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration might be interpreted positively by some as signifying a willingness to cooperate with the administration, it's not a strong indicator of any significant positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price.  The news lacks specifics about policy changes affecting Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning slightly positive and others neutral or even slightly negative.  The overall sentiment expressed in the previous predictions and the lack of concrete information in the news itself suggest that the impact on Apple's stock price will be minimal.  Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are roughly equal, with other market factors likely to be far more influential.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a specific mention of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and does not provide any material information that would significantly impact AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral. Therefore, the probability of a significant rise or fall in AAPL's stock price due to this news is minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline and content suggest that Jim Cramer views Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a 'wildcard to the downside', indicating a potential for the stock price to decline. Cramer also expressed skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter, mentioning that many analysts believe Apple could surprise to the downside. This negative sentiment expressed by a well-known financial analyst could lead to a decrease in investor confidence and an increased likelihood of the stock price falling. However, it's worth noting that Cramer's comments may not necessarily reflect the company's actual performance, and market reactions can be unpredictable. Considering the overall tone and content of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article highlights the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at President Donald Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.

Considering the mixed sentiment and the presence of other tech executives at the inauguration, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain. However, given the slightly positive tone of the article and the potential for improved relations with the administration, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising. The previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, with some predicting a higher probability of a rise and others predicting a higher probability of a fall. Taking these predictions into account, I will provide an estimate that is somewhat conservative, given the uncertainty of the situation.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration. Some models suggest this could be seen as a positive signal for maintaining a favorable relationship with the Trump administration, potentially leading to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policies. However, other models highlight the mixed sentiments around the event and the presence of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Given the conflicting signals and the lack of specific new information beneficial to Apple's immediate business prospects, the overall impact seems neutral to slightly positive.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at a significant political event, which may be interpreted positively by investors as it suggests a willingness to engage with the new administration.

While this could be viewed positively, ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech remain a concern. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight trend towards positive sentiment in the most recent round. Considering this, I'll lean slightly towards a positive impact, but acknowledge the uncertainty and potential for negative impacts from legal challenges and market volatility. The fact that some models consistently predict a low impact suggests that the news is not a major driver of stock price movement.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price.  Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration could be interpreted positively by some as showing a willingness to cooperate with the administration, potentially leading to less regulatory pressure. However, this is speculative and the news provides no concrete information about policy changes affecting Apple.  The previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from a 10% chance of a rise or fall to a 70% chance of a fall.  This wide range reflects the inherent uncertainty surrounding the impact of this event on Apple's stock.  The overall sentiment is mixed, with no clear consensus.  Given the lack of specific positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, and the conflicting predictions, I assign roughly equal probabilities to a price rise and fall, acknowledging that other market factors will likely have a much greater influence.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights the absence of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang from Trump's inauguration, while noting the attendance of other Big Tech CEOs. This information is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and does not provide any material impact on Apple's business or stock price. The previous predictions reflect a mix of neutral to slightly positive sentiments, but none suggest a significant impact.

Some models suggest this could be seen as a positive signal for maintaining a favorable relationship with the Trump administration, potentially leading to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policies. However, other models highlight the mixed sentiments around the event and the presence of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech companies, including Apple. Given the conflicting signals and the lack of specific new information beneficial to Apple's immediate business prospects, the overall impact seems neutral to slightly positive. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities with slight leans towards both rising and falling.

Given the lack of specific positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, and the conflicting predictions, I assign roughly equal probabilities to a price rise and fall, acknowledging that other market factors will likely have a much greater influence.  The consistent near-equal probabilities across multiple rounds and models suggest the event itself is unlikely to be a significant driver of short-term price movement.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news highlights the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at President Donald Trump's inauguration, which could be interpreted as a positive signal for maintaining a favorable relationship with the administration.

(AAPL) and its potential vulnerability to any reports of an iPhone downturn, as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple's revenue. Cramer's view of Apple as a 'wildcard to the downside' and his skepticism about the company's upcoming quarter suggest a potential for negative impact on investor sentiment. However, some models also interpret the attendance of Apple CEO at a significant political event as a positive signal for maintaining a favorable relationship with the government, which could lead to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions for Apple. Given the mixed sentiment and uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news on Apple's stock price, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price decline due to Cramer's comments and the potential for negative impacts from legal challenges.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news about Apple CEO Tim Cook attending President Donald Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, which could potentially lead to a more favorable business environment for Apple.
