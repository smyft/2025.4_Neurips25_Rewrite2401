(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\nNews Content: As President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony is underway, many are taking note of the Silicon Valley personalities in attendance. Yahoo Finance host Rachelle Akuffo joins the program to acknowledge several of the Big Tech CEOs at Trump's swearing-in, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta Platforms' (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Apple (AAPL) chief executive, and even TikTok president Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAhead of the January 20 ceremony, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang stated he will be out of the country but \"look[s] forward to congratulating the Trump administration when they take office.\"\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights the presence of Apple CEO at a significant political event, which may be perceived positively by investors as it indicates a strong relationship between big tech and the government. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is uncertain as it depends on broader market reactions to the inauguration and any potential policy changes that may arise. Given the mixed sentiment surrounding political events, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the potential for volatility, leading to a lower probability of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least less negative, relationship between Apple and a future Trump administration. While past tensions existed, Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. The overall impact is likely slightly positive, as maintaining a good relationship with the government is generally beneficial for large corporations. The mention of potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms and general market news is less directly relevant to Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret this as positive (showing a willingness to cooperate with the administration), others might view it negatively (depending on their political leanings and perceptions of Trump's policies).  However, the news itself provides no specific information about potential policy changes affecting Apple or any indication of positive or negative impacts on the company's business. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and short-lived. The probability of a price increase or decrease is roughly equal, with market forces and other news likely to have a far greater impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip in China and Taiwan. This news is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL) and does not provide any material information that would significantly impact AAPL's stock price. Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely neutral.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's comments suggest that Apple's stock is a 'wildcard to the downside' and that he doesn't think Apple will have a good quarter. He also mentions that many analysts believe Apple could surprise to the downside, which could lead to a self-fulfilling prophecy. Additionally, Cramer notes that the stock had a spurt at the end of the year that seemed unwarranted and that both Apple and NVIDIA have been laggards since the year began. These comments are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and increase the probability of a stock price decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, including Apple. The attendance of major tech executives, such as Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship. This could potentially lead to a more favorable business environment for Apple. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the article, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential for improved relations with the administration, but also acknowledge the possibility of a decline due to regulatory risks.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
