(AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump's inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, as it suggests a close relationship between the tech industry and the government. This could lead to favorable policies for tech companies, including Apple. However, the political climate and potential controversies surrounding Trump's administration could also create uncertainty. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least neutral, outlook for Apple. While Trump's past relationship with Big Tech has been tense, the attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or even potential benefits for Apple under a Trump administration. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive signal of Cook's attendance likely outweighs the general concern about antitrust cases, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall. The news is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, so the probabilities are not extreme.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concerns about the overreliance on iPhone sales, the potential for a disappointing quarter, and the general market sentiment suggesting a downside surprise. While he acknowledges the possibility of a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is pessimistic, indicating a higher likelihood of a price drop.  The article also highlights the influence of the Chinese economy on Apple's performance, adding another layer of uncertainty.  The fact that many analysts predict a downside surprise suggests the market is already pricing in some negative news, reducing the probability of a significant positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and reflections, particularly focusing on complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and performance, they also highlight potential headwinds and slower growth compared to other companies. The article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Instead, it serves as a reflective piece on investing habits. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral tone and lack of actionable news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have been a concern for investors. However, this development could be seen as a positive step, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. Given this context, the news might have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as improved relations with the administration could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of these CEOs may indicate a willingness to work with the new administration, which could be perceived as positive for the companies involved. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Therefore, the estimated probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are based on the potential for positive sentiment and cooperation with the new administration, rather than any concrete financial or operational developments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses mistakes in investing and provides a general reflection on the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence. While it mentions Apple specifically, the article is not focused on any immediate negative news concerning Apple but rather serves as a general warning against investment complacency. This reflection is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price significantly in the near term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration is likely to be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a potential for improved relations between Apple and the new administration. This could lead to favorable policies for Apple, reducing regulatory risks. While there are concerns about the political climate and ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, the overall sentiment from the news is neutral to slightly positive. Considering the previous predictions, the consensus leans towards a higher probability of stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially improved relationship between Apple and the Trump administration, signaled by Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration. This could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment or reduced political headwinds for Apple. While the article also mentions ongoing antitrust concerns for Big Tech, the positive signal of Cook's attendance likely outweighs this general concern. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight bullish sentiment overall, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. I will adjust my prediction to reflect this consensus, but not too drastically, as the news isn't overwhelmingly positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary is overwhelmingly negative regarding Apple's prospects. He highlights concerns about iPhone sales dependence, anticipates a disappointing quarter, and believes the market is already pricing in a negative surprise.  This aligns with the sentiment expressed by some previous models. While the article mentions a potential 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, Cramer's overall pessimism outweighs this positive factor. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the negative sentiment from Cramer, a well-known market commentator, carries significant weight.  The lack of any significantly positive countervailing news further strengthens the case for a higher probability of a price fall.  Therefore, the probabilities are skewed towards a price decrease, although not as drastically as some previous models suggested.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article is a reflective piece on investing mistakes, with a specific mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency. The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance but also points out potential headwinds and slower growth compared to other companies. The article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Instead, it serves as a general warning against investment complacency. Given the neutral tone and lack of actionable news, the article is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, highlighting the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration. This event suggests an effort to improve relations between Apple and the administration, which could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment. While there are mentions of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, the overall tone suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of probabilities, but generally lean towards a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple's CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony may be perceived as a positive sign for the company, as it suggests a willingness to work with the new administration. This could potentially lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple. However, the news does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential for positive sentiment and cooperation with the new administration. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news and the mixed but slightly positive predictions from other models, the estimated probabilities are based on the potential for positive sentiment and the lack of concrete negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on the author's personal reflections and investing mistakes rather than providing specific news or updates about Apple Inc. The article emphasizes the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence, which can be considered a general cautionary message rather than directly impacting Apple's stock price. While it mentions Apple as an example, it does not introduce any new information that would suggest a significant positive or negative shift. The overall tone is neutral with a slight emphasis on avoiding complacency, which may not have a direct, immediate impact on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
