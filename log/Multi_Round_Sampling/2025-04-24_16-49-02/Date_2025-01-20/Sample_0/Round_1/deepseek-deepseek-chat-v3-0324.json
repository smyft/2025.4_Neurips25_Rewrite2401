(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump's inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, as it suggests a close relationship between the tech industry and the government. This could lead to favorable policies for tech companies, including Apple. However, the political climate and potential controversies surrounding Trump's administration could also create uncertainty. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least neutral, outlook for Apple. While Trump's past relationship with Big Tech has been tense, the attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or even potential benefits for Apple under a Trump administration. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive signal of Cook's attendance likely outweighs the general concern about antitrust cases, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall. The news is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, so the probabilities are not extreme.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concerns about the overreliance on iPhone sales, the potential for a disappointing quarter, and the general market sentiment suggesting a downside surprise. While he acknowledges the possibility of a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is pessimistic, indicating a higher likelihood of a price drop.  The article also highlights the influence of the Chinese economy on Apple's performance, adding another layer of uncertainty.  The fact that many analysts predict a downside surprise suggests the market is already pricing in some negative news, reducing the probability of a significant positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and reflections, particularly focusing on complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and performance, they also highlight potential headwinds and slower growth compared to other companies. The article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Instead, it serves as a reflective piece on investing habits. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral tone and lack of actionable news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have been a concern for investors. However, this development could be seen as a positive step, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. Given this context, the news might have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as improved relations with the administration could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of these CEOs may indicate a willingness to work with the new administration, which could be perceived as positive for the companies involved. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Therefore, the estimated probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are based on the potential for positive sentiment and cooperation with the new administration, rather than any concrete financial or operational developments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses mistakes in investing and provides a general reflection on the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence. While it mentions Apple specifically, the article is not focused on any immediate negative news concerning Apple but rather serves as a general warning against investment complacency. This reflection is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price significantly in the near term.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
