A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump's inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, as it suggests a close relationship between the tech industry and the government. This could lead to favorable policies for tech companies, including Apple. However, the political climate and potential controversies surrounding Trump's administration could also create uncertainty. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least neutral, outlook for Apple. While Trump's past relationship with Big Tech has been tense, the attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or even potential benefits for Apple under a Trump administration. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive signal of Cook's attendance likely outweighs the general concern about antitrust cases, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall. The news is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, so the probabilities are not extreme.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concerns about the overreliance on iPhone sales, the potential for a disappointing quarter, and the general market sentiment suggesting a downside surprise. While he acknowledges the possibility of a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is pessimistic, indicating a higher likelihood of a price drop.  The article also highlights the influence of the Chinese economy on Apple's performance, adding another layer of uncertainty.  The fact that many analysts predict a downside surprise suggests the market is already pricing in some negative news, reducing the probability of a significant positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and reflections, particularly focusing on complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and performance, they also highlight potential headwinds and slower growth compared to other companies. The article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Instead, it serves as a reflective piece on investing habits. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral tone and lack of actionable news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have been a concern for investors. However, this development could be seen as a positive step, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. Given this context, the news might have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as improved relations with the administration could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of these CEOs may indicate a willingness to work with the new administration, which could be perceived as positive for the companies involved. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Therefore, the estimated probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are based on the potential for positive sentiment and cooperation with the new administration, rather than any concrete financial or operational developments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses mistakes in investing and provides a general reflection on the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence. While it mentions Apple specifically, the article is not focused on any immediate negative news concerning Apple but rather serves as a general warning against investment complacency. This reflection is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price significantly in the near term.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
