A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO at a high-profile event like Trump's inauguration may be perceived positively by investors, as it suggests a close relationship between the tech industry and the government. This could lead to favorable policies for tech companies, including Apple. However, the political climate and potential controversies surrounding Trump's administration could also create uncertainty. Overall, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least neutral, outlook for Apple. While Trump's past relationship with Big Tech has been tense, the attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or even potential benefits for Apple under a Trump administration. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could create some uncertainty. Overall, the positive signal of Cook's attendance likely outweighs the general concern about antitrust cases, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall. The news is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, so the probabilities are not extreme.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary on Apple is largely negative. He expresses concerns about the overreliance on iPhone sales, the potential for a disappointing quarter, and the general market sentiment suggesting a downside surprise. While he acknowledges the possibility of a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, his overall tone is pessimistic, indicating a higher likelihood of a price drop.  The article also highlights the influence of the Chinese economy on Apple's performance, adding another layer of uncertainty.  The fact that many analysts predict a downside surprise suggests the market is already pricing in some negative news, reducing the probability of a significant positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and reflections, particularly focusing on complacency with Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and performance, they also highlight potential headwinds and slower growth compared to other companies. The article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Instead, it serves as a reflective piece on investing habits. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The probabilities are estimated based on the neutral tone and lack of actionable news.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have been a concern for investors. However, this development could be seen as a positive step, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. Given this context, the news might have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as improved relations with the administration could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's chief executive, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of these CEOs may indicate a willingness to work with the new administration, which could be perceived as positive for the companies involved. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Therefore, the estimated probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are based on the potential for positive sentiment and cooperation with the new administration, rather than any concrete financial or operational developments.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses mistakes in investing and provides a general reflection on the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence. While it mentions Apple specifically, the article is not focused on any immediate negative news concerning Apple but rather serves as a general warning against investment complacency. This reflection is unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price significantly in the near term.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration is likely to be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a potential for improved relations between Apple and the new administration. This could lead to favorable policies for Apple, reducing regulatory risks. While there are concerns about the political climate and ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, the overall sentiment from the news is neutral to slightly positive. Considering the previous predictions, the consensus leans towards a higher probability of stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially improved relationship between Apple and the Trump administration, signaled by Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration. This could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment or reduced political headwinds for Apple. While the article also mentions ongoing antitrust concerns for Big Tech, the positive signal of Cook's attendance likely outweighs this general concern. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight bullish sentiment overall, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. I will adjust my prediction to reflect this consensus, but not too drastically, as the news isn't overwhelmingly positive.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's commentary is overwhelmingly negative regarding Apple's prospects. He highlights concerns about iPhone sales dependence, anticipates a disappointing quarter, and believes the market is already pricing in a negative surprise.  This aligns with the sentiment expressed by some previous models. While the article mentions a potential 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, Cramer's overall pessimism outweighs this positive factor. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the negative sentiment from Cramer, a well-known market commentator, carries significant weight.  The lack of any significantly positive countervailing news further strengthens the case for a higher probability of a price fall.  Therefore, the probabilities are skewed towards a price decrease, although not as drastically as some previous models suggested.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article is a reflective piece on investing mistakes, with a specific mention of Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency. The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance but also points out potential headwinds and slower growth compared to other companies. The article does not provide any new fundamental or technical data that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Instead, it serves as a general warning against investment complacency. Given the neutral tone and lack of actionable news, the article is unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be balanced.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies, highlighting the attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration. This event suggests an effort to improve relations between Apple and the administration, which could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment. While there are mentions of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, the overall tone suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook for Apple. The previous predictions from various models indicate a range of probabilities, but generally lean towards a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple's CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony may be perceived as a positive sign for the company, as it suggests a willingness to work with the new administration. This could potentially lead to a more favorable regulatory environment for Apple. However, the news does not provide any specific information about Apple's business or operations that would directly impact its stock price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the potential for positive sentiment and cooperation with the new administration. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news and the mixed but slightly positive predictions from other models, the estimated probabilities are based on the potential for positive sentiment and the lack of concrete negative news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on the author's personal reflections and investing mistakes rather than providing specific news or updates about Apple Inc. The article emphasizes the importance of updating investment theses and performing due diligence, which can be considered a general cautionary message rather than directly impacting Apple's stock price. While it mentions Apple as an example, it does not introduce any new information that would suggest a significant positive or negative shift. The overall tone is neutral with a slight emphasis on avoiding complacency, which may not have a direct, immediate impact on the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration is likely to be perceived positively by investors, suggesting a potential for improved relations between Apple and the new administration. This could lead to favorable policies and reduced regulatory risks for Apple. While there are concerns about the political climate and ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, the overall sentiment from the news is neutral to slightly positive. The previous predictions indicate a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.62, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.38, Reasoning: The news focuses on Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, signaling a potential for improved relations between Apple and the administration. This could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment. However, ongoing antitrust concerns for Big Tech remain a factor. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight bullish sentiment overall, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising. I will adjust my prediction to reflect this consensus, but not too drastically, as the news isn't overwhelmingly positive. The negative commentary from Jim Cramer in previous rounds seems to be an outlier, and the general trend is towards a slightly positive outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news piece is primarily focused on Jim Cramer's generally negative outlook on Apple, citing concerns about iPhone sales dependence, potential for a disappointing quarter, and market sentiment suggesting a downside surprise.  While the article mentions some positive aspects, such as the potential for a 'stronger for longer' iPhone cycle, Cramer's overall pessimistic tone and the lack of substantial countervailing positive news significantly outweighs these.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the negative sentiment from Cramer, a prominent market commentator, carries considerable weight.  The consensus from previous rounds leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, which aligns with Cramer's assessment.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall, reflecting the negative market sentiment and expert opinion presented.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article is a reflective piece on investing mistakes, with a specific mention of Apple Inc.
