(AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny could create uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. However, the market's perception of the relationship between Apple and the new administration could influence investor sentiment. If investors believe this signals a potentially favorable regulatory or business environment for Apple under the Trump administration, it could lead to a slight increase in stock price. Conversely, if investors perceive this as a negative signal (e.g., potential for increased scrutiny or policy changes that could harm Apple), it could lead to a slight decrease. Given the limited information and the generally neutral nature of attending an inauguration, the probabilities are close to 50/50, with a slight lean towards a positive reaction due to the potential for perceived favorable business conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, one of which involves Apple.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and history but points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that complacency in holding the stock is a mistake.  However, the author doesn't predict a fall in Apple's stock price, only highlighting the need for continued diligence and reassessment of the investment thesis.  The overall tone is not negative towards Apple, but rather cautionary.  The mention of slower growth compared to other companies and the need for continued diligence suggests a slightly higher probability of stagnation or slower growth than a significant price drop. The article itself does not provide any information that would directly cause a stock price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting concerns about the company's reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock has been lagging since the beginning of the year and expresses skepticism about the company's upcoming quarter performance. Additionally, he references broader market concerns, including the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple. Given the negative tone and the emphasis on potential downside risks, the news is likely to have a bearish impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have been a concern for investors. However, this development could be seen as a positive step, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. Given this context, the news might have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as improved relations with the administration could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential performance. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock is vulnerable to reports of an iPhone downturn and that the company's revenue is heavily dependent on iPhone sales. He also expresses skepticism about Apple's potential for a good quarter, stating that many analysts believe the stock may surprise to the downside. However, it's worth noting that Cramer's comments are not entirely negative, and he suggests that investors should 'own' Apple rather than 'trade' it. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but not drastically so, as Cramer's comments are not overwhelmingly bearish.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise. Considering previous predictions, there is a general lean towards a positive sentiment, but caution remains due to the potential for regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, at Donald Trump's inauguration. This suggests a potential for improved relations between Apple and the Trump administration. While the news doesn't guarantee specific policy changes, the willingness to engage could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a more favorable regulatory environment. Considering the previous round's predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a positive impact and others towards a negative one. Given the potential for improved relations and the mixed prior predictions, I'll slightly favor a positive movement, but not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance but highlights the slowing growth rate relative to other companies and the risk of complacency.  The article doesn't present any new, significant information about Apple's financial health or future prospects that would drastically alter market sentiment.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a substantial price movement in either direction. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based on limited information.  Given the lack of specific negative or positive news about Apple, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outcome, with a slightly higher chance of stagnation than a significant price change in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL), particularly its heavy reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks. Cramer expresses skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter performance and mentions that the stock has been lagging since the beginning of the year. Additionally, he references broader market concerns, including the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple. While Cramer suggests that investors should 'own' Apple rather than 'trade' it, the overall tone of his comments is cautious and leans towards a bearish outlook. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This event could be perceived as a positive step towards improved relations between Apple and the administration, potentially leading to a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny against Big Tech could create uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed view on the impact of this news on Apple's stock price. Some models suggest a slightly positive impact due to improved relations with the administration, while others express concerns about Apple's growth and potential regulatory risks. Taking these factors into account, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting concerns about the company's reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock has been lagging since the beginning of the year and expresses skepticism about the company's upcoming quarter performance. Additionally, he references broader market concerns, including the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple. Given the negative tone and the emphasis on potential downside risks, the news is likely to have a bearish impact on investor sentiment. However, considering the previous predictions and the trend of others' beliefs, the probabilities are not drastically skewed towards a fall. The overall sentiment from various models suggests a cautious approach, with some indicating a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the mentioned risks and others suggesting a more neutral or slightly positive stance due to potential improvements in the business environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the attendance of Apple's CEO Tim Cook at the 2025 Trump Inauguration. While this event alone may not have a significant impact on the company's stock price, it could indicate a strategic decision by Apple to engage with the new administration. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models predicting a slight rise due to improved relations, and others predicting falls due to potential regulatory risks or concerns about Apple's performance. Considering the limited direct impact of the event itself and balancing the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, the event is unlikely to drastically affect the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny introduce uncertainty. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a positive impact due to improved relations and others expressing caution due to potential regulatory risks. Overall, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, reflecting a cautious optimism about the potential for a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting a potential for improved relations between Apple and the administration. This could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the actual impact is uncertain. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a positive impact and others towards a negative one, often citing concerns about Apple's growth or potential regulatory risks. The trend shows a slight decrease in the probability of a rise and a slight increase in the probability of a fall compared to the initial predictions. Given the potential for improved relations but also the existing uncertainties and the trend in previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a positive movement, but not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example.

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based on limited information. Considering the lack of specific negative or positive news about Apple and the mixed predictions from previous rounds, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively unchanged, with a small chance of a slight increase or decrease. The author's cautionary tone suggests a slightly higher probability of stagnation or slower growth than a significant price drop.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.
