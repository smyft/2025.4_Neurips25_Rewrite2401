(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny could create uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. However, the market's perception of the relationship between Apple and the new administration could influence investor sentiment. If investors believe this signals a potentially favorable regulatory or business environment for Apple under the Trump administration, it could lead to a slight increase in stock price. Conversely, if investors perceive this as a negative signal (e.g., potential for increased scrutiny or policy changes that could harm Apple), it could lead to a slight decrease. Given the limited information and the generally neutral nature of attending an inauguration, the probabilities are close to 50/50, with a slight lean towards a positive reaction due to the potential for perceived favorable business conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, one of which involves Apple.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and history but points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that complacency in holding the stock is a mistake.  However, the author doesn't predict a fall in Apple's stock price, only highlighting the need for continued diligence and reassessment of the investment thesis.  The overall tone is not negative towards Apple, but rather cautionary.  The mention of slower growth compared to other companies and the need for continued diligence suggests a slightly higher probability of stagnation or slower growth than a significant price drop. The article itself does not provide any information that would directly cause a stock price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting concerns about the company's reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock has been lagging since the beginning of the year and expresses skepticism about the company's upcoming quarter performance. Additionally, he references broader market concerns, including the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple. Given the negative tone and the emphasis on potential downside risks, the news is likely to have a bearish impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have been a concern for investors. However, this development could be seen as a positive step, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. Given this context, the news might have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as improved relations with the administration could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential performance. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock is vulnerable to reports of an iPhone downturn and that the company's revenue is heavily dependent on iPhone sales. He also expresses skepticism about Apple's potential for a good quarter, stating that many analysts believe the stock may surprise to the downside. However, it's worth noting that Cramer's comments are not entirely negative, and he suggests that investors should 'own' Apple rather than 'trade' it. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but not drastically so, as Cramer's comments are not overwhelmingly bearish.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise. Considering previous predictions, there is a general lean towards a positive sentiment, but caution remains due to the potential for regulatory scrutiny.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's Tim Cook, at Donald Trump's inauguration. This suggests a potential for improved relations between Apple and the Trump administration. While the news doesn't guarantee specific policy changes, the willingness to engage could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a more favorable regulatory environment. Considering the previous round's predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a positive impact and others towards a negative one. Given the potential for improved relations and the mixed prior predictions, I'll slightly favor a positive movement, but not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and historical performance but highlights the slowing growth rate relative to other companies and the risk of complacency.  The article doesn't present any new, significant information about Apple's financial health or future prospects that would drastically alter market sentiment.  Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a substantial price movement in either direction. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements based on limited information.  Given the lack of specific negative or positive news about Apple, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outcome, with a slightly higher chance of stagnation than a significant price change in either direction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc. (AAPL), particularly its heavy reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks. Cramer expresses skepticism about Apple's upcoming quarter performance and mentions that the stock has been lagging since the beginning of the year. Additionally, he references broader market concerns, including the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple. While Cramer suggests that investors should 'own' Apple rather than 'trade' it, the overall tone of his comments is cautious and leans towards a bearish outlook. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline discusses Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech and mentions Apple CEO Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration. This event could be perceived as a positive step towards improved relations between Apple and the administration, potentially leading to a more favorable regulatory environment. However, the ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny against Big Tech could create uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed view on the impact of this news on Apple's stock price. Some models suggest a slightly positive impact due to improved relations with the administration, while others express concerns about Apple's growth and potential regulatory risks. Taking these factors into account, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting concerns about the company's reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock has been lagging since the beginning of the year and expresses skepticism about the company's upcoming quarter performance. Additionally, he references broader market concerns, including the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple. Given the negative tone and the emphasis on potential downside risks, the news is likely to have a bearish impact on investor sentiment. However, considering the previous predictions and the trend of others' beliefs, the probabilities are not drastically skewed towards a fall. The overall sentiment from various models suggests a cautious approach, with some indicating a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the mentioned risks and others suggesting a more neutral or slightly positive stance due to potential improvements in the business environment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news highlights the attendance of Apple's CEO Tim Cook at the 2025 Trump Inauguration. While this event alone may not have a significant impact on the company's stock price, it could indicate a strategic decision by Apple to engage with the new administration. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models predicting a slight rise due to improved relations, and others predicting falls due to potential regulatory risks or concerns about Apple's performance. Considering the limited direct impact of the event itself and balancing the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, the event is unlikely to drastically affect the stock price.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple.

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a positive impact and others towards a negative one, often citing concerns about Apple's growth or potential regulatory risks. The trend shows a slight decrease in the probability of a rise and a slight increase in the probability of a fall compared to the initial predictions. Given the potential for improved relations but also the existing uncertainties and the trend in previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a positive movement, but not overwhelmingly so, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on general investing mistakes and uses Apple as one example.
