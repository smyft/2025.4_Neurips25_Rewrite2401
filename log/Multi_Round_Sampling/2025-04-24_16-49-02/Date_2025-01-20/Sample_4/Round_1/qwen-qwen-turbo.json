A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny could create uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. However, the market's perception of the relationship between Apple and the new administration could influence investor sentiment. If investors believe this signals a potentially favorable regulatory or business environment for Apple under the Trump administration, it could lead to a slight increase in stock price. Conversely, if investors perceive this as a negative signal (e.g., potential for increased scrutiny or policy changes that could harm Apple), it could lead to a slight decrease. Given the limited information and the generally neutral nature of attending an inauguration, the probabilities are close to 50/50, with a slight lean towards a positive reaction due to the potential for perceived favorable business conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news article discusses three investing mistakes made by the author, one of which involves Apple.  The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and history but points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that complacency in holding the stock is a mistake.  However, the author doesn't predict a fall in Apple's stock price, only highlighting the need for continued diligence and reassessment of the investment thesis.  The overall tone is not negative towards Apple, but rather cautionary.  The mention of slower growth compared to other companies and the need for continued diligence suggests a slightly higher probability of stagnation or slower growth than a significant price drop. The article itself does not provide any information that would directly cause a stock price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting concerns about the company's reliance on iPhone sales and potential downside risks. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock has been lagging since the beginning of the year and expresses skepticism about the company's upcoming quarter performance. Additionally, he references broader market concerns, including the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple. Given the negative tone and the emphasis on potential downside risks, the news is likely to have a bearish impact on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. The attendance of Apple CEO Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to improve relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have been a concern for investors. However, this development could be seen as a positive step, potentially reducing regulatory risks for Apple. Given this context, the news might have a slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price, as improved relations with the administration could lead to a more favorable regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential performance. Cramer mentions that Apple's stock is vulnerable to reports of an iPhone downturn and that the company's revenue is heavily dependent on iPhone sales. He also expresses skepticism about Apple's potential for a good quarter, stating that many analysts believe the stock may surprise to the downside. However, it's worth noting that Cramer's comments are not entirely negative, and he suggests that investors should 'own' Apple rather than 'trade' it. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, but not drastically so, as Cramer's comments are not overwhelmingly bearish.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
