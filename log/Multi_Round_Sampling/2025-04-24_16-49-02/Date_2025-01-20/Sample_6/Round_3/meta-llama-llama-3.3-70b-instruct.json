(AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a desire for collaboration, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny may create uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it mentions Cramer's general positive sentiment towards owning the stock long-term ('own them, don't trade them'), it also highlights his concerns about a potentially weak upcoming quarter and the impact of the Chinese economy. The phrase 'Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs' suggests a negative surprise is possible. The article also mentions that many analysts anticipate a potential downside surprise, which, while potentially priced in, still leans towards a negative sentiment. The article also mentions that other AI stocks may be more promising than AAPL. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret this as positive (suggesting potential for smoother relations between the tech industry and the administration), others might view it negatively (depending on their political leanings and expectations regarding Trump's policies).  However, the news itself provides no concrete information about potential policy changes or regulatory actions that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The overall impact is likely to be minimal, with market forces and other news dominating price movements. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have led to market uncertainty, but the attendance of major tech executives could be interpreted as a positive signal for reduced regulatory risks. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the market might view this development as slightly positive for Apple, given the potential for improved government relations, but the impact is likely muted due to the broader regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency, noting that despite Apple's strong brand and past performance, there are signs that the company's growth may be slowing due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The article does not contain any directly negative news about Apple, nor does it provide new information that would significantly alter the company's outlook. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral, with a slight bias towards a potential fall due to the mention of headwinds and complacency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential performance. Cramer expresses concerns about Apple's reliance on iPhone sales and the potential impact of the Chinese economy on the company. He also mentions that many analysts believe Apple's stock has gotten overvalued and may surprise to the downside. Based on this analysis, it appears that Cramer is bearish on Apple's short-term prospects. However, it's worth noting that Cramer advises to 'own, don't trade' Apple, suggesting a long-term optimistic view. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news, but still acknowledge a possibility of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The attendance of tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration suggests efforts to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. However, the article also highlights ongoing legal challenges faced by Big Tech, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the mixed implications, there is moderate uncertainty but no clear indicator of a significant short-term movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggesting a desire for collaboration. This could be interpreted positively by investors, indicating reduced regulatory risks. However, the ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny mentioned in the news introduce uncertainty. The mixed sentiments from previous predictions indicate a cautious outlook, with some analysts leaning towards a negative sentiment due to concerns about Apple's growth and market conditions. Overall, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, reflecting optimism about improved relations with the administration, but tempered by the existing regulatory challenges.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple (AAPL) from Jim Cramer. He highlights concerns about iPhone sales, the Chinese economy, and potential downside surprises. While he suggests owning the stock long-term, his short-term concerns and the consensus among analysts for a potential downside surprise weigh heavily on the immediate stock price outlook. The previous rounds of predictions show a mixed sentiment, but the most recent ones lean towards a negative outlook. Considering Cramer's influence and the specific concerns raised, a higher probability of a stock price fall is estimated.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.47, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple.  Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration could be interpreted positively by some as signaling a desire for cooperation and potentially less regulatory friction. However, this is a very weak signal, and the news itself provides no concrete information about policy changes affecting Apple.  The previous predictions are quite varied, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.  Given the lack of substantial positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, and the mixed signals from previous predictions, I assign a slightly higher probability to no significant change in the stock price.  The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a much larger impact than this news item.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with a focus on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The presence of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration is seen as a gesture to maintain favorable relations, which could be interpreted positively by investors. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny, which introduces uncertainty. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but the potential for regulatory risks keeps the outlook balanced. Given the mixed signals, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral stance with a slight edge towards a rise due to the potential for improved government relations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond.

Considering the mixed signals from Cramer and the overall market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The previous predictions from other models also show a trend of decreasing optimism, with some models indicating a higher probability of a stock price fall. Therefore, I predict a probability of stock price rise of 0.42 and a probability of stock price fall of 0.58.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a desire for collaboration, which could be perceived positively by investors.
