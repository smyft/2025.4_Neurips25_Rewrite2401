(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a desire for collaboration, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny may create uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it mentions Cramer's general positive sentiment towards owning the stock long-term ('own them, don't trade them'), it also highlights his concerns about a potentially weak upcoming quarter and the impact of the Chinese economy. The phrase 'Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs' suggests a negative surprise is possible. The article also mentions that many analysts anticipate a potential downside surprise, which, while potentially priced in, still leans towards a negative sentiment. The article also mentions that other AI stocks may be more promising than AAPL. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret this as positive (suggesting potential for smoother relations between the tech industry and the administration), others might view it negatively (depending on their political leanings and expectations regarding Trump's policies).  However, the news itself provides no concrete information about potential policy changes or regulatory actions that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The overall impact is likely to be minimal, with market forces and other news dominating price movements. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have led to market uncertainty, but the attendance of major tech executives could be interpreted as a positive signal for reduced regulatory risks. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the market might view this development as slightly positive for Apple, given the potential for improved government relations, but the impact is likely muted due to the broader regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency, noting that despite Apple's strong brand and past performance, there are signs that the company's growth may be slowing due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The article does not contain any directly negative news about Apple, nor does it provide new information that would significantly alter the company's outlook. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral, with a slight bias towards a potential fall due to the mention of headwinds and complacency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential performance. Cramer expresses concerns about Apple's reliance on iPhone sales and the potential impact of the Chinese economy on the company. He also mentions that many analysts believe Apple's stock has gotten overvalued and may surprise to the downside. Based on this analysis, it appears that Cramer is bearish on Apple's short-term prospects. However, it's worth noting that Cramer advises to 'own, don't trade' Apple, suggesting a long-term optimistic view. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news, but still acknowledge a possibility of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The attendance of tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration suggests efforts to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. However, the article also highlights ongoing legal challenges faced by Big Tech, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the mixed implications, there is moderate uncertainty but no clear indicator of a significant short-term movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
