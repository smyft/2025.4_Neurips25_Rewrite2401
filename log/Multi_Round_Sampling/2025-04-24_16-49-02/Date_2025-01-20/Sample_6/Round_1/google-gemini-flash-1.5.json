(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\nNews Content: As President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony is underway, many are taking note of the Silicon Valley personalities in attendance.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a desire for collaboration, which could be perceived positively by investors. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny may create uncertainty. Overall, the sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise than fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it mentions Cramer's general positive sentiment towards owning the stock long-term ('own them, don't trade them'), it also highlights his concerns about a potentially weak upcoming quarter and the impact of the Chinese economy. The phrase 'Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs' suggests a negative surprise is possible. The article also mentions that many analysts anticipate a potential downside surprise, which, while potentially priced in, still leans towards a negative sentiment. The article also mentions that other AI stocks may be more promising than AAPL. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at President Trump's inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret this as positive (suggesting potential for smoother relations between the tech industry and the administration), others might view it negatively (depending on their political leanings and expectations regarding Trump's policies).  However, the news itself provides no concrete information about potential policy changes or regulatory actions that would directly impact Apple's stock price. The overall impact is likely to be minimal, with market forces and other news dominating price movements. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards no significant change.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, tensions between Trump and Big Tech have led to market uncertainty, but the attendance of major tech executives could be interpreted as a positive signal for reduced regulatory risks. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antimonopoly cases introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the market might view this development as slightly positive for Apple, given the potential for improved government relations, but the impact is likely muted due to the broader regulatory environment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency, noting that despite Apple's strong brand and past performance, there are signs that the company's growth may be slowing due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The article does not contain any directly negative news about Apple, nor does it provide new information that would significantly alter the company's outlook. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral, with a slight bias towards a potential fall due to the mention of headwinds and complacency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL) and its potential performance. Cramer expresses concerns about Apple's reliance on iPhone sales and the potential impact of the Chinese economy on the company. He also mentions that many analysts believe Apple's stock has gotten overvalued and may surprise to the downside. Based on this analysis, it appears that Cramer is bearish on Apple's short-term prospects. However, it's worth noting that Cramer advises to 'own, don't trade' Apple, suggesting a long-term optimistic view. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news, but still acknowledge a possibility of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The attendance of tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration suggests efforts to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. However, the article also highlights ongoing legal challenges faced by Big Tech, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the mixed implications, there is moderate uncertainty but no clear indicator of a significant short-term movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The previous predictions are quite varied, reflecting the inherent uncertainty.
