A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip to China and Taiwan. While this news is relevant to Nvidia, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus on Big Tech executives and their relationships with the incoming administration may create a broader sentiment in the tech sector, but it is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least less negative, relationship between Apple and a future Trump administration. While past tensions existed, Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. The overall impact is likely slightly positive, as maintaining a good relationship with the government is generally beneficial for large corporations. The mention of potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms and general market news is less directly relevant to Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is not directly relevant to Apple (AAPL). The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but there's no information connecting Apple's performance or stock price to this event. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this specific news is extremely low. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip. The article does not provide any direct financial or operational impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news is not directly related to Apple's business, products, or financial performance, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc.'s CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates a connection with the incoming administration. However, the article does not contain any specific information about Apple's financials, products, or significant announcements that would directly impact the stock price. Therefore, the attendance itself is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. The probability of a stock price rise or fall is estimated based on the neutral to slightly positive sentiment that may arise from the CEO's presence at the event.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but instead focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other Big Tech executives' relationships with President-elect Donald Trump. Since the news does not contain any information about Apple's financial performance, products, or business operations, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a cautious outlook for Apple, pointing out concerns over iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the relationship with China. His skepticism about Apple's upcoming performance and the overall negative sentiment among analysts indicate a likely downward pressure on the stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
