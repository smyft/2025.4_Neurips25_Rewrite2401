(AAPL): \u2018Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Recently Discussed These 17 Stocks And Chinese Hackers.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nJim Cramer's appearance on Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th covered a wide variety of topics. As the day was in the final few days of the outgoing Biden administration, Cramer shared his thoughts about the policies of the outgoing and incoming governments. Commenting on President-elect Trump's nominee for Treasury Secretary, Scott Bessent's confirmation hearing Cramer shared that he \"liked it.\" He shared the reasons behind his approval.\n\n\"Well, I think that, in the end, he respects the process. I think a lot of the, I think there's the process respecters and the process undoers,\" Cramer thinks. He \"felt that Secretary Bessent, soon to be, I gotta be careful, who knows, he's talking about, there was a give and take. There was a moment when he was give and take with Senator Sanders.\" While during their exchange, Cramer thought \"Sanders thought that he was gonna, tee off on Sanders.\" However, Bessent and Sanders actually \"had common ground, and there was a lot of respect. And then I think Sanders had nothing to say, it was kind of like, okay,\" according to the CNBC host.\n\nAnother hot topic in the markets is the President-elect's potential policies on cryptocurrency. When asked by co-host Sara Eisen about his thoughts on Trump passing an executive order for crypto, Cramer stated \"I agree and I think, well look the President-elect has made it no secret that he wants a strategic crypto reserve. So I'm not quite sure where that would be. Not in Fort Knox, it's kind of, anywhere, right. I would like to make sure the blockchain is severe. I'm trying really hard to get a grip on that reserve because it doesn't jump out at me.\"\n\nOne country that Cramer regularly targets in his morning thoughts is China. This time around, he likened China to East Germany. \" We thought East Germany was incredibly powerful. They would go to the Olympics, and we'd say they're amazing. We thought their schools were really great. And it turned out to be an empty suit,\" believes Cramer. China needs \"exports, they need everybody, they need help from everyone and they don't wanna help anyone,\" according to him.\n\nIn fact, China might be one of the reasons \"President-elect Trump was elected,\" he shared. Cramer shared that this is \"because the Chinese dumped everything in every, of what we used to make. I mean my father sold gift wrap. They wiped out the gift wrap companies. So my father ended up working for the Chinese. They were nice to him.\" China's hostility leads Cramer to \"think that we all should be cognizant that the Chinese are not our friends. But they are trying. I think that's smart to try.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe CNBC host also shared his on a recent conversation between China's President Xi Jinping and the President-elect. \"Well look I think that Taiwan is a hot button. Because President-elect Trump has said why doesn't Taiwan pay more for its defense? I get that. That's a kind of the NATO, consistent, right, consistent with NATO,\" he shared. Cramer also shared his thoughts on Bessent saying tariffs are not inflationary. According to him, \"Well, I liked that even though everything we've ever read all our lives says that they're inflationary.\"\n\nHe still likes Bessent since Cramer believes \"Bessent's a serious guy. I mean when you sit down and you watch these presentations and interactions in the European world where they interview him. The man is so thoughtful. That you're close to Secretary Yellen, I think that in terms of a chess match, I'll bet Bessent. He's really exciting. He's an exciting intellect.\" In fact, Cramer thinks that Bessent \"may know more about the way the economy interacts with our country than anyone out there.\"\n\nFinally, the outgoing Biden administration, particularly the Treasury Department, has been repeatedly targeted by Chinese hackers. Cramer quoted a cybersecurity CEO and shared:\n\n\"He was describing how out of date most of our government is in terms of identity. Meaning that you can, someone's hacking you, you're blocked, because they don't have the eye, like you know it's vision, or it's finger. And we don't do that. We use very old fashioned technology from the nineties where it's very easy to hack. Everyone in the world knows the last four digits of your social security number.. . .we need to have visual, or we need to have fingerprint, and we don't. Which is crazy.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 17th.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer electronics firm in the world. It has been a regular feature in Cramer's recent shows. The CNBC host believes that the iPhone's sales play an unnecessarily large role in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s hypothesis. The stock is vulnerable to any reports of an iPhone downturn as the smartphone accounts for more than half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s revenue. Cramer has also dismissed Mark Zuckerberg's criticism of innovation ending at the firm since Steve Jobs' death. This time around, he commented on the impact of the Chinese economy on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\"Well I mean look, people are trying to justify like Evercore comes out and says listen we got the stronger for longer iPhone cycle. Uh, yeah that's true but the decline I think had a lot to do with the fact that the stock had this spurt, at the end of the year that seemed really. I mean what was that about? I mean NVIDIA had somewhat of a similar one and both stocks have just been laggards since the year began. And it's just a lot of controversy, a lot of belief that the stocks have gotten overvalued. I say, own them, don't trade them. But, I don't think Apple's going to have a good quarter. Who does think Apple's going to have a good quarter? I mean that's the thing when you read these pieces of research, Sarah, they're all saying you know what Apple could surprise to the downside. Well, if everyone says that Apple's going to surprise to the downside then what kind of surprise is it? It's a surprising non-surprise.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip to China and Taiwan. While this news is relevant to Nvidia, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus on Big Tech executives and their relationships with the incoming administration may create a broader sentiment in the tech sector, but it is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least less negative, relationship between Apple and a future Trump administration. While past tensions existed, Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. The overall impact is likely slightly positive, as maintaining a good relationship with the government is generally beneficial for large corporations. The mention of potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms and general market news is less directly relevant to Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is not directly relevant to Apple (AAPL). The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but there's no information connecting Apple's performance or stock price to this event. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this specific news is extremely low. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip. The article does not provide any direct financial or operational impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news is not directly related to Apple's business, products, or financial performance, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc.'s CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates a connection with the incoming administration. However, the article does not contain any specific information about Apple's financials, products, or significant announcements that would directly impact the stock price. Therefore, the attendance itself is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. The probability of a stock price rise or fall is estimated based on the neutral to slightly positive sentiment that may arise from the CEO's presence at the event.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but instead focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other Big Tech executives' relationships with President-elect Donald Trump. Since the news does not contain any information about Apple's financial performance, products, or business operations, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a cautious outlook for Apple, pointing out concerns over iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the relationship with China. His skepticism about Apple's upcoming performance and the overall negative sentiment among analysts indicate a likely downward pressure on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a mention of other Big Tech executives attending, the overall sentiment does not provide significant positive or negative implications for Apple. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with many indicating low likelihoods of significant movement in AAPL's stock price due to this news. Therefore, I estimate a low probability of stock price movement for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between Big Tech and a potential future Trump administration. Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration suggests Apple is trying to maintain a positive relationship, which could be beneficial. However, the news also mentions ongoing antitrust concerns for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models seeing minimal impact and others leaning slightly positive or negative. Given the uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative influences, I'll lean towards a neutral stance with a slight positive bias, acknowledging the potential benefits of a good relationship with the government.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO and other tech CEOs' attendance (or lack thereof) at Trump's inauguration.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple.  While some models suggest a slight positive or negative impact based on general sentiment around tech and the Trump administration, the connection is tenuous at best. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the lack of direct impact.  The absence of any Apple-specific news makes it highly unlikely that this news will significantly move Apple's stock price in either direction.  Therefore, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence.

Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on its stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal. The previous predictions also largely support this view, with most models indicating low probabilities of significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives, including Apple's CEO, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony.

However, the article does not contain any specific information about Apple's financials, products, or significant announcements that would directly impact the stock price.

The overall sentiment from the article is neutral to slightly positive, but given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business, the probabilities of a significant stock price rise or fall are relatively low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article does not directly relate to Apple Inc.

Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer expressing a cautious outlook for the company. Cramer's skepticism about iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the relationship with China suggests a negative sentiment. Given the weight of Cramer's commentary and the overall skeptical tone, the probability of a stock price decline is higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip, which does not directly impact Apple Inc.

However, the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business operations leads to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between Big Tech and a potential future Trump administration, highlighting Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration as a sign of Apple trying to maintain a positive relationship. This could be beneficial for Apple, potentially leading to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions. However, the news also mentions ongoing antitrust concerns for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models seeing minimal impact and others leaning slightly positive or negative. The trend seems to be settling towards a more neutral stance. Given the uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative influences, I'll lean towards a slightly positive bias, acknowledging the potential benefits of a good relationship with the government, but tempering it with the antitrust concerns. The previous round's high fall prediction seems to be an outlier and not well-supported by the news content.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO and the attendance of other tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple. The news provides no direct information about Apple's financials, products, or future prospects.

Yet, the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business suggests that the news is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. Considering the range of opinions from previous predictions, there is a slight inclination towards a neutral to slightly positive sentiment due to the CEO's attendance, but the overall impact is expected to be minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence.
