A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip to China and Taiwan. While this news is relevant to Nvidia, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus on Big Tech executives and their relationships with the incoming administration may create a broader sentiment in the tech sector, but it is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news suggests a potentially positive, or at least less negative, relationship between Apple and a future Trump administration. While past tensions existed, Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration signals an effort to maintain a favorable relationship. This could lead to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. The overall impact is likely slightly positive, as maintaining a good relationship with the government is generally beneficial for large corporations. The mention of potential consolidation in small-cap tech firms and general market news is less directly relevant to Apple's stock price in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from President Trump's inauguration due to a pre-planned business trip to China and Taiwan.  This news is not directly relevant to Apple (AAPL). The article mentions other tech CEOs attending the inauguration, but there's no information connecting Apple's performance or stock price to this event. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this specific news is extremely low. Any price movement in AAPL would likely be driven by other factors unrelated to this news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence due to a preplanned business trip. The article does not provide any direct financial or operational impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Since the news is not directly related to Apple's business, products, or financial performance, it is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are minimal.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc.'s CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates a connection with the incoming administration. However, the article does not contain any specific information about Apple's financials, products, or significant announcements that would directly impact the stock price. Therefore, the attendance itself is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. The probability of a stock price rise or fall is estimated based on the neutral to slightly positive sentiment that may arise from the CEO's presence at the event.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content do not directly relate to Apple Inc. (AAPL) but instead focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and other Big Tech executives' relationships with President-elect Donald Trump. Since the news does not contain any information about Apple's financial performance, products, or business operations, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer's commentary suggests a cautious outlook for Apple, pointing out concerns over iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the relationship with China. His skepticism about Apple's upcoming performance and the overall negative sentiment among analysts indicate a likely downward pressure on the stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip, which does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a mention of other Big Tech executives attending, the overall sentiment does not provide significant positive or negative implications for Apple. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with many indicating low likelihoods of significant movement in AAPL's stock price due to this news. Therefore, I estimate a low probability of stock price movement for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between Big Tech and a potential future Trump administration. Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration suggests Apple is trying to maintain a positive relationship, which could be beneficial. However, the news also mentions ongoing antitrust concerns for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models seeing minimal impact and others leaning slightly positive or negative. Given the uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative influences, I'll lean towards a neutral stance with a slight positive bias, acknowledging the potential benefits of a good relationship with the government.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO and other tech CEOs' attendance (or lack thereof) at Trump's inauguration.  This is largely irrelevant to Apple.  While some models suggest a slight positive or negative impact based on general sentiment around tech and the Trump administration, the connection is tenuous at best. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the lack of direct impact.  The absence of any Apple-specific news makes it highly unlikely that this news will significantly move Apple's stock price in either direction.  Therefore, the probabilities of a price rise or fall are very low.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives at President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, with a focus on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence.

Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on its stock price.

The previous predictions also largely support this view, with most models indicating low probabilities of significant movement.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article discusses the attendance of Big Tech executives, including Apple's CEO, at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates a connection with the incoming administration. However, the article does not contain any specific information about Apple's financials, products, or significant announcements that would directly impact the stock price. Therefore, the attendance itself is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. The overall sentiment from the article is neutral to slightly positive, but given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business, the probabilities of a significant stock price rise or fall are relatively low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The news article does not directly relate to Apple Inc.

Since the news does not contain any information about Apple's financial performance, products, or business operations, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.

Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is estimated to be low.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL), with Jim Cramer expressing a cautious outlook for the company. Cramer's skepticism about iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the relationship with China suggests a negative sentiment. Given the weight of Cramer's commentary and the overall skeptical tone, the probability of a stock price decline is higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip, which does not directly impact Apple Inc.

However, the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business operations leads to a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between Big Tech and a potential future Trump administration, highlighting Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration as a sign of Apple trying to maintain a positive relationship. This could be beneficial for Apple, potentially leading to less regulatory pressure or more favorable policy decisions. However, the news also mentions ongoing antitrust concerns for Big Tech, which could negatively impact Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models seeing minimal impact and others leaning slightly positive or negative. The trend seems to be settling towards a more neutral stance. Given the uncertainty and the potential for both positive and negative influences, I'll lean towards a slightly positive bias, acknowledging the potential benefits of a good relationship with the government, but tempering it with the antitrust concerns. The previous round's high fall prediction seems to be an outlier and not well-supported by the news content.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article focuses on Nvidia's CEO and the attendance of other tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration.

(AAPL), with Jim Cramer expressing a cautious outlook for the company. Cramer's skepticism about iPhone sales, market expectations, and geopolitical factors such as the relationship with China suggests a negative sentiment. Given the weight of Cramer's commentary and the overall skeptical tone, the probability of a stock price decline is higher.
