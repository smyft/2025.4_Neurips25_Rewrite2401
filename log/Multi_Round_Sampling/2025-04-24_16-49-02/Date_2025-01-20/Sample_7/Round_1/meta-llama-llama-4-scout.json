A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip to China and Taiwan. While this news is relevant to Nvidia, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus on Big Tech executives and their relationships with the incoming administration may create a broader sentiment in the tech sector, but it is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling remain relatively neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. However, the market's perception of the relationship between Apple and the new administration could influence investor sentiment. A positive interpretation (e.g., potential for favorable policies) might lead to a slight increase, while a negative interpretation (e.g., concerns about potential trade conflicts or regulatory scrutiny) could lead to a slight decrease. Given the uncertainty and the generally neutral nature of the news, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a positive reaction due to the potential for perceived improved relations with the government.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret the presence of tech CEOs at a Trump inauguration as potentially positive (depending on their political leanings and Trump's policies), it's unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The market generally reacts more strongly to concrete policy changes or financial announcements than to symbolic events like inaugurations.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. Any movement is more likely to be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, Trump's administration has been critical of Big Tech, but this gesture could imply reduced regulatory risks for Apple in the near term. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust challenges, which could pose long-term risks. The market may view Cook's attendance positively, interpreting it as a strategic move to mitigate regulatory pressures. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the immediate positive sentiment from the perceived easing of tensions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates the company's engagement with the administration. However, the article does not contain any specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price, such as new product announcements, financial results, or major business deals. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the neutral to positive perception of the CEO's attendance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of major tech executives, such as Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the president. This could potentially lead to favorable policies or treatment for Apple Inc., which might positively impact its stock price. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Given the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship dynamics between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. It mentions an initial tension but highlights an attendance at his inauguration by major tech CEOs, suggesting a potential rapprochement. The article does not provide specific news about Apple Inc., nor any direct impact indicators on the stock price. However, the general tone suggests a potentially improved relationship between Trump and tech companies, which might have a positive sentiment on the market perception of tech stocks.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
