(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump Inauguration 2025: The Big Tech CEOs in attendance\nNews Content: As President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony is underway, many are taking note of the Silicon Valley personalities in attendance. Yahoo Finance host Rachelle Akuffo joins the program to acknowledge several of the Big Tech CEOs at Trump's swearing-in, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk, Amazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos, Meta Platforms' (META) Mark Zuckerberg, Apple (AAPL) chief executive, and even TikTok president Shou Zi Chew.\n\nAhead of the January 20 ceremony, Nvidia (NVDA) CEO Jensen Huang stated he will be out of the country but \"look[s] forward to congratulating the Trump administration when they take office.\"\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's absence from Trump's inauguration and his business trip to China and Taiwan. While this news is relevant to Nvidia, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). The focus on Big Tech executives and their relationships with the incoming administration may create a broader sentiment in the tech sector, but it is unlikely to have a significant direct effect on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling remain relatively neutral.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's CEO attended Donald Trump's inauguration. This event, in isolation, is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. However, the market's perception of the relationship between Apple and the new administration could influence investor sentiment. A positive interpretation (e.g., potential for favorable policies) might lead to a slight increase, while a negative interpretation (e.g., concerns about potential trade conflicts or regulatory scrutiny) could lead to a slight decrease. Given the uncertainty and the generally neutral nature of the news, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a positive reaction due to the potential for perceived improved relations with the government.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news reports the attendance of several Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's 2025 inauguration.  This is a relatively neutral event. While some might interpret the presence of tech CEOs at a Trump inauguration as potentially positive (depending on their political leanings and Trump's policies), it's unlikely to have a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. The market generally reacts more strongly to concrete policy changes or financial announcements than to symbolic events like inaugurations.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. Any movement is more likely to be due to other market factors rather than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain favorable relations. Historically, Trump's administration has been critical of Big Tech, but this gesture could imply reduced regulatory risks for Apple in the near term. However, the article also mentions ongoing antitrust challenges, which could pose long-term risks. The market may view Cook's attendance positively, interpreting it as a strategic move to mitigate regulatory pressures. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the immediate positive sentiment from the perceived easing of tensions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates the company's engagement with the administration. However, the article does not contain any specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price, such as new product announcements, financial results, or major business deals. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the neutral to positive perception of the CEO's attendance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc. The attendance of major tech executives, such as Tim Cook, at Trump's inauguration suggests an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the president. This could potentially lead to favorable policies or treatment for Apple Inc., which might positively impact its stock price. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Given the mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship dynamics between President Donald Trump and Big Tech companies. It mentions an initial tension but highlights an attendance at his inauguration by major tech CEOs, suggesting a potential rapprochement. The article does not provide specific news about Apple Inc., nor any direct impact indicators on the stock price. However, the general tone suggests a potentially improved relationship between Trump and tech companies, which might have a positive sentiment on the market perception of tech stocks.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the attendance of various Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's inauguration. While this event may suggest a potential for improved relations between Apple and the new administration, it does not provide any concrete information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. The overall sentiment appears neutral, with a slight inclination towards a positive interpretation due to the presence of Apple's CEO at a high-profile event. However, the lack of direct implications for Apple's business or financial performance leads to a balanced view on stock price movement probabilities.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses on the attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration, suggesting a potential effort to maintain or improve relations with the administration. While this event is largely symbolic, it can be interpreted as a positive signal, potentially leading to favorable policies or reduced regulatory scrutiny for Apple. However, the impact is likely to be moderate, as the market is more influenced by concrete financial results and policy changes. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight leaning towards a positive impact, but the overall effect is expected to be limited. The fact that some models predicted a higher probability of a rise suggests that there might be a perception of reduced regulatory risk, which is a positive signal.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news is largely symbolic.  While the presence of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration might be interpreted positively by some as signaling a desire for good relations with the administration, it lacks concrete information about policy changes or business impacts.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise.  The lack of direct impact on Apple and the overall neutral nature of the event suggest that any stock price movement will likely be minor and driven by broader market forces rather than this specific news.  Considering the previous predictions and the lack of substantial news directly affecting Apple, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  A slight bias towards a rise is possible due to the potential for improved relations with the administration, but this is likely to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the evolving relationship between President Donald Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling a potential effort to maintain favorable relations. While this could be seen as a positive gesture, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antitrust cases, which could pose risks. The market may interpret Cook's attendance as a strategic move to mitigate regulatory pressures, leading to a slightly positive sentiment. However, the overall impact is likely to be minimal given the lack of concrete policy changes or financial announcements. Considering the mixed signals and the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news, the probability of the stock price rising is marginally higher than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article reports on the attendance of Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO at President-elect Donald Trump's 2025 Inauguration ceremony, along with other Big Tech CEOs. This event is neutral in nature and does not provide specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price, such as new product announcements, financial results, or major business deals. The presence of the CEO at a high-profile event may be perceived neutrally or positively by investors, as it indicates the company's engagement with the administration. However, the article does not contain any concrete details that would sway the stock price significantly in either direction. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the neutral to positive perception of the CEO's attendance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc.

However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. Considering the mixed signals and the relatively neutral nature of the news, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. The previous predictions from other models also indicate a balanced view with a slight inclination towards a positive impact, which supports this assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news discusses the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration. This event can be interpreted as a sign of efforts to maintain a positive relationship with the Trump administration, which could potentially lead to favorable policies. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, including antimonopoly cases, which could negatively impact stock prices. Overall, the news provides mixed signals, but given historical precedence and the symbolic nature of the event, the probability of a positive impact is slightly higher.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the attendance of various Big Tech CEOs, including Apple's CEO, at Trump's inauguration. While this event may suggest a potential for improved relations between Apple and the new administration, it does not provide any concrete information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price. The overall sentiment appears neutral, with a slight inclination towards a positive interpretation due to the presence of Apple's CEO at a high-profile event. However, the lack of direct implications for Apple's business or financial performance leads to a balanced view on stock price movement probabilities. Considering the previous predictions, there is a slight lean towards a positive impact due to the potential for perceived improved relations with the government.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news focuses on Apple's CEO attending Trump's inauguration, suggesting a potential for improved relations. While symbolic, this could lead to favorable policies. However, ongoing antitrust challenges for Big Tech remain a concern. Previous predictions show a slight lean towards a positive impact, but the overall effect is expected to be limited. Considering the mixed signals and the neutral to slightly positive tone, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news is largely symbolic and lacks concrete information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price.  The attendance of Apple's CEO at Trump's inauguration could be interpreted positively by some as signaling a desire for good relations with the administration, potentially mitigating regulatory risks. However, this is a relatively weak signal, and the market is more likely to react to concrete financial results or policy changes.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly centered around a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall.  Considering the lack of direct impact on Apple and the overall neutral nature of the event, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the potential for improved relations with the administration, but acknowledging the limited impact of this event alone. The convergence of predictions towards a slightly positive outlook reinforces this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news discusses the attendance of Apple's CEO Tim Cook at President Trump's inauguration, which could be interpreted as a positive signal for improved relations between Apple and the administration. However, the article also mentions ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antitrust cases, which could pose risks. The event is largely symbolic and lacks concrete financial or policy impacts, leading to a neutral overall sentiment.

This event is largely symbolic and may indicate an effort to maintain or improve relations with the administration. While there are no direct implications for Apple's business or financial performance, the presence of its CEO at a high-profile event could be perceived positively by investors, potentially leading to a slight increase in stock price. However, given the lack of concrete policy changes or financial announcements, the overall impact is likely to be minimal. The mixed signals and relatively neutral nature of the news suggest that the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a positive impact due to the perceived easing of tensions and potential for favorable policies.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news article discusses President Donald Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech, including Apple Inc.
