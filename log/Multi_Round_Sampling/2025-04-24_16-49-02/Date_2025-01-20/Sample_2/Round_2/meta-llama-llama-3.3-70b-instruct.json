(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple Inc.'s vulnerability, particularly regarding its reliance on iPhone sales and potential downturns in performance. Cramer suggests that the market sentiment is leaning towards a negative outlook for Apple, with many analysts predicting a disappointing quarter. This sentiment, combined with Cramer's characterization of Apple as a 'wildcard to the downside,' indicates a higher probability of stock price decline. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While it mentions Cramer's general positive sentiment towards owning the stock long-term ('own them, don't trade them'), it also highlights his concerns about a potentially weak upcoming quarter and the impact of the Chinese economy. The phrase 'Apple Wildcard To The Downside. It\u2019s Kind Of A Two Of Clubs' suggests a negative surprise is possible. The article also mentions that many analysts anticipate a potential downside surprise, which, while potentially priced in, still leans towards a negative sentiment. The article also mentions that other AI stocks may be more promising than AAPL. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  However, the article's focus is broader, covering the general relationship between Trump and Big Tech, and also mentions ongoing legal challenges facing large tech companies.  The connection between Cook's attendance and a direct impact on Apple's stock price is weak.  The article doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's business or financials. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction. The probability of price movement is largely attributed to other market factors not mentioned in this news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and reflections, specifically mentioning Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency. The author acknowledges that while Apple is a strong company with a valuable brand, its growth metrics over the past decade may not justify the assumption that its 'boom times' will continue indefinitely. However, the article does not present any new, negative information about Apple's financials or operations that would likely impact its stock price in the short term. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence investor sentiment or the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes the author won't repeat in 2025 and beyond. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency, noting that despite Apple's strong brand and past performance, there are signs that the company's growth may be slowing due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The news does not contain any directly negative or groundbreaking information about Apple's future prospects. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be neutral or slightly negative due to the mention of potential headwinds and complacency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, including not updating investment theses, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a company where the author was complacent, assuming the company's success would continue forever. However, the article notes that Apple's growth, while impressive, is slower than some other companies, and the company faces headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of core markets. The author concludes that they will be more diligent in monitoring Apple's performance. The article does not contain any significantly positive or negative news about Apple, but rather serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of ongoing diligence in investing. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low, as it does not contain any major revelations or surprises.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The attendance of tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration suggests efforts to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. However, the article also highlights ongoing legal challenges faced by Big Tech, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Given the mixed implications, there is moderate uncertainty but no clear indicator of a significant short-term movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights Jim Cramer's concerns about Apple's vulnerability, particularly regarding its reliance on iPhone sales and the potential for a disappointing quarter. Cramer's characterization of Apple as a 'wildcard to the downside' suggests a negative sentiment among analysts, with many predicting a downside surprise. This aligns with previous predictions indicating a higher probability of stock price decline. While there are some positive long-term sentiments expressed, the overall tone leans towards caution and potential weakness in the near term, leading to a higher probability of a stock price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple from Jim Cramer, highlighting concerns about iPhone sales, the Chinese economy's impact, and potential downside surprises. Cramer's 'wildcard to the downside' comment and the consensus among analysts that Apple might disappoint suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline. While Cramer suggests owning the stock long-term, the short-term sentiment appears negative. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, which also leaned towards a negative outlook, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect this stronger bearish signal. The mention of AI stocks potentially offering better returns further diminishes the appeal of AAPL in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news piece focuses on the evolving relationship between President Trump and Big Tech companies, with Tim Cook's attendance at the inauguration being highlighted.  While this might suggest a desire for positive relations with the administration, the overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news lacks specific information about Apple's financials or operations.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but none strongly suggesting a significant movement in either direction.  Considering the lack of direct impact from the news and the mixed predictions from other models, I assign a near-neutral probability to both price rise and fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and reflections, with a focus on Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of complacency. The author acknowledges Apple's strong brand and past performance but raises concerns about slowing growth due to market penetration and competition in its core markets. However, the article does not provide any new negative financial or operational data that would significantly impact the stock price in the short term. The tone is more reflective and cautionary rather than alarmist. Previous predictions from other models also indicate a neutral to slightly negative sentiment, with probabilities leaning marginally towards a price fall. Considering the lack of concrete negative news and the overall balanced tone of the article, the probability of a significant price movement is low.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, including not updating investment theses, assuming the best outcome, and complacency. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is mentioned in the context of complacency, noting that despite its strong brand and past performance, there are signs that the company's growth may be slowing due to market penetration and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The article does not contain any directly negative or groundbreaking information about Apple's future prospects. The various models' predictions range from a 0.35 to 0.5 probability of the stock price rising and 0.3 to 0.65 probability of the stock price falling. Given the generally neutral to slightly negative sentiment expressed in the article and the range of predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's personal investing mistakes and reflections, specifically mentioning Apple Inc.
