(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Trump's evolving relationship with Big Tech: Trends to watch\nNews Content: President Donald Trump\u2019s relationship with Big Tech has been tense in the past, marked by public feuds with CEOs such as Jeff Bezos of Amazon (AMZN) and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta (META).\n\nHowever, despite historic tensions, major tech executives, including Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, attended Trump\u2019s inauguration on Monday \u2014 signaling an effort to stay in the president's favor.\n\nIn the video above, Josh Lipton discusses the possibility of more consolidation in small-cap tech firms as well as the ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech, such as antimonopoly cases against top companies.\n\nWatch President Donald Trump's 2025 inauguration ceremony while staying up to date with all the market news and economic data covered by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch Related Videos\n\n02:00\n\nUS is pivoting into a 'G-Zero World Order,' Ian Bremmer describes\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 1 hour ago 02:55\n\nWatch: Three Key Moments From Trump's 2025 Inauguration\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 01:25\n\nElon Musk After Trump\u2019s Inauguration: \u2018This Is What Victory Feels Like\u2019\n\nWSJ \u2022 3 hours ago 00:48\n\nTrump seems to 'color within the lines so far' on federal powers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 hours ago\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny could create uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses an investor's reflections on past investing mistakes, including complacency regarding Apple (AAPL). While the article acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, products, growth potential), it also points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that it faces market saturation. The author admits to complacency and plans to be more diligent in the future. This is a slightly negative signal, as it suggests that the investor's initial bullish thesis may need re-evaluation. However, the article also states that Apple is still a favorable investment. The inclusion of past 'Double Down' recommendations from the Motley Fool, including Apple, is a subtle attempt to maintain a positive outlook. Overall, the news is mildly negative, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise in the short term. The article is more about general investing principles than a specific negative catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  However, the article's focus is broader, covering the general relationship between Trump and Big Tech, and also mentions ongoing legal challenges facing large tech companies.  The connection between Cook's attendance and a direct impact on Apple's stock price is weak.  The article doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's business or financials. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction. The probability of price movement is largely attributed to other market factors not mentioned in this news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to stay in favor. Historically, Trump's administration has been critical of Big Tech, but this gesture could imply reduced regulatory risks or favorable policies for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges like antimonopoly cases, which could pose risks. The market might view Cook's attendance positively, interpreting it as a strategic move to mitigate regulatory pressures. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the perceived reduction in immediate regulatory threats.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes, one of which involves Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author mentions holding Apple for a long time and notes that while the company's performance over the last 10 years has been impressive, it has not been spectacular compared to other companies, and there are potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. However, the author concludes that Apple is still a favorable investment. The news does not contain any directly negative or positive revelations about Apple's future prospects, but rather a personal reflection on investment strategies. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral, with a slight bias towards a positive view as the author still considers it a favorable investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, including not updating the investment thesis in a timely fashion, assuming the best outcome would occur, and complacency. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an example of a company where the author was complacent and assumed the boom times would continue forever. However, the article also notes that Apple's quarterly revenue and free cash flow have grown significantly over the last 10 years, but at a slower pace than some other companies. The author concludes that they will invest more effort in doing diligence on Apple's stock, even in the absence of major changes. Based on this analysis, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple's stock, as the author is acknowledging the need to be more vigilant but still considers the company a favorable investment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggesting a desire to maintain a positive relationship. This could be interpreted as a reduction in regulatory risks for Apple, which is generally favorable for the stock. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the positive implications of Cook's attendance may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise, but the mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses an investor's reflections on past investing mistakes, including complacency regarding Apple (AAPL). While the article acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, products, growth potential), it also points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that it faces market saturation. The author admits to complacency and plans to be more diligent in the future. This is a slightly negative signal, as it suggests that the investor's initial bullish thesis may need re-evaluation. However, the article also states that Apple is still a favorable investment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a slight rise and others towards a slight fall. Given the slightly negative sentiment in the article and the mixed opinions in previous rounds, I will adjust the probabilities slightly downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece is largely tangential to Apple's stock price. While Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration might be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill towards the administration, the article doesn't offer any concrete information about potential policy changes affecting Apple.  The mention of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech is generic and doesn't specifically target Apple.  The overall tone is neutral.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive and others slightly negative.  Given the lack of direct impact from the news, and the neutral to slightly positive sentiment from previous models, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but the difference is marginal.  The majority of price movement will likely be driven by broader market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration. This could be perceived as a strategic move to mitigate regulatory risks, which is generally positive for Apple's stock. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny, which could create uncertainty. Given the mixed signals, the market might view Cook's attendance positively, interpreting it as a reduction in immediate regulatory threats. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a neutral to slightly positive impact, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses the author's reflections on past investing mistakes, including complacency regarding Apple (AAPL). While it acknowledges Apple's strengths, such as its brand, products, and growth potential, it also points out that the company's growth rate has slowed relative to others and that it faces market saturation and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment. The neutral to slightly positive tone of the article, along with the absence of directly negative revelations about Apple's future prospects, suggests that the stock price may remain stable or rise slightly. The author's admission of complacency and the need for more diligence does not inherently suggest a negative outlook but rather a cautious one.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, including complacency regarding Apple Inc.

However, the author concludes that Apple is still a favorable investment. Considering the neutral to slightly positive tone of the article and the lack of directly negative revelations about Apple's future prospects, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on the attendance of various Big Tech CEOs at Trump's inauguration, with particular emphasis on Apple CEO Tim Cook's presence. This suggests a strategic effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, which could potentially lead to favorable regulatory policies or reduced regulatory risks for Apple. While the news itself does not directly relate to Apple's financial performance or business operations, it implies a positive sentiment towards Apple. However, the probability of a significant stock price movement based solely on this news is relatively low. The mixed signals provided by different models suggest a balanced view, with a slight positive bias.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
