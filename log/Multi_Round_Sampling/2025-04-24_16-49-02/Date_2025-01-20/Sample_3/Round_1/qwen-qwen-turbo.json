A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny could create uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses an investor's reflections on past investing mistakes, including complacency regarding Apple (AAPL). While the article acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, products, growth potential), it also points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that it faces market saturation. The author admits to complacency and plans to be more diligent in the future. This is a slightly negative signal, as it suggests that the investor's initial bullish thesis may need re-evaluation. However, the article also states that Apple is still a favorable investment. The inclusion of past 'Double Down' recommendations from the Motley Fool, including Apple, is a subtle attempt to maintain a positive outlook. Overall, the news is mildly negative, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise in the short term. The article is more about general investing principles than a specific negative catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  However, the article's focus is broader, covering the general relationship between Trump and Big Tech, and also mentions ongoing legal challenges facing large tech companies.  The connection between Cook's attendance and a direct impact on Apple's stock price is weak.  The article doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's business or financials. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction. The probability of price movement is largely attributed to other market factors not mentioned in this news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to stay in favor. Historically, Trump's administration has been critical of Big Tech, but this gesture could imply reduced regulatory risks or favorable policies for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges like antimonopoly cases, which could pose risks. The market might view Cook's attendance positively, interpreting it as a strategic move to mitigate regulatory pressures. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the perceived reduction in immediate regulatory threats.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes, one of which involves Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author mentions holding Apple for a long time and notes that while the company's performance over the last 10 years has been impressive, it has not been spectacular compared to other companies, and there are potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. However, the author concludes that Apple is still a favorable investment. The news does not contain any directly negative or positive revelations about Apple's future prospects, but rather a personal reflection on investment strategies. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral, with a slight bias towards a positive view as the author still considers it a favorable investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, including not updating the investment thesis in a timely fashion, assuming the best outcome would occur, and complacency. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an example of a company where the author was complacent and assumed the boom times would continue forever. However, the article also notes that Apple's quarterly revenue and free cash flow have grown significantly over the last 10 years, but at a slower pace than some other companies. The author concludes that they will invest more effort in doing diligence on Apple's stock, even in the absence of major changes. Based on this analysis, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple's stock, as the author is acknowledging the need to be more vigilant but still considers the company a favorable investment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
