(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Subtle Investing Mistakes I Won't Repeat in 2025 And Beyond\nNews Content: It's normal to make more than a few flubs while investing, especially when you're new. At the same time, we owe it to ourselves to be humble and to recognize when we've made a mistake with our finances. There's no point in beating yourself up, but there's a big point to understanding what went wrong and how to do it better the next time -- after all, there's money on the line.\n\nNot every mistake has to be a catastrophe, obviously. But it's still worth ironing out the kinks in your investing habits, especially if you plan to be investing for decades to come. With that in mind, I'd like to share three examples of less-serious oversights I made in 2024 so that you can (hopefully) avoid them in your own investing life.\n\n1. Not updating my investment thesis in a timely fashion\n\nOne of my rules is that I need to have a strong and pithy investment thesis for every investment I make, and for any that I write about, too. But an investment thesis simply can't be a monolith that stands unchanged over time, as markets are constantly changing, and businesses are constantly updating their strategies to compete more effectively both today and in the future.\n\nThe more complicated the industry and the more complicated the company, the more moving parts there are for the investor to take into account when formulating a thesis, which entails a larger responsibility to update the thesis more frequently. Even when broadly upholding that responsibility, it's still very possible to miss the forest for the trees, as I did with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE).\n\nSince roughly 2020, my investment thesis called for Pfizer to be a favorable stock to buy and hold because of its large portfolio of pharmaceuticals and its demonstrated competency in research and development (R&D), as reflected by its massive pipeline.\n\nNonetheless, the stock is down by 45% over the last three years, badly underperforming the market's gain of 31%. Clearly, something wasn't working, but I kept circling back to the same factors that were originally in my investment thesis, finding them to still be sound.\n\nThen, late in 2024, an activist investing group called Starboard Value said that it had taken a $1 billion stake in Pfizer with the goal of improving the company's efficiency. The group published a report outlining many areas where it thought that the company was struggling, including specifically its R&D efficiency and its capital allocation strategy.\n\nReading the report, I was gobsmacked; the activist group had essentially explained to me quite fastidiously that my investment thesis was no longer accurate. I immediately changed my stance on the stock to be a bit more bearish.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne lesson here is to listen to any nagging feelings you have about a stock and its performance. If your investment thesis still seems true on the surface in the face of a company's difficulties, dig deeper into the details, and be ready to update your mental model accordingly.\n\n2. Assuming the best outcome would occur\n\nAnother subtle investing mistake I made pertains to Costco Wholesale, (NASDAQ: COST), which to this day remains my single most favorite investment.\n\nIn late 2023, Costco's CEO announced he would be retiring, and that he would be replaced in the following year by Ron Vachris, who was the company's president at the time and an employee for 40 years. Given Costco's tradition of successfully promoting leaders from within, I reacted positively to the news and thought nothing more it.\n\nBut that was a mistake, even if it didn't carry negative consequences. My level of trust in the board of directors was and still is fairly high. Nothing has gone wrong with Costco under its new management. I'll buy more shares as I'm able to do so.\n\nStill, if you don't perform any due diligence when you know there has been a major change with one of your investments, like a new CEO, it's much harder to build the conviction necessary to hold on to your shares for the longer periods of time, where you'll see the largest growth.\n\nThink about it. Psychologically, it's much better to have a hunch about which new factor is causing things to go right -- or wrong -- than it is to look at your returns and feel confused about what's happening. Checking the details is how to become a better investor.\n\n3. Complacency\n\nI've held Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) for quite some time now. Everyone knows that Apple will be selling iPhones, MacBooks, and iCloud subscriptions until the end of time, not to mention a bunch of other products and services. Its brand is most likely the most valuable on the planet, and it has an endless runway for more growth.\n\nBut does the company's actual performance bear out all of this common \"knowledge\" that formed the basis for my investment in the stock? In a word, no. Over the last 10 years, its quarterly revenue has risen by 63.6%, reaching $94.9 billion, and its free cash flow (FCF) has grown by 43.9%, reaching $23.9 billion.\n\nThose figures are impressive for a gargantuan business, to be sure. But in relative terms, there are many other companies that are expanding at a much faster pace. Similarly, it is very likely that Apple is facing some headwinds due to its comprehensive penetration of its core markets like smartphones, which are also highly competitive.\n\nMy mistake here was to assume that the boom times both could and would continue forever with Apple. There is no guarantee that the stock will fall, and it's still a favorable investment.\n\nBut the only way to avoid the unanticipated consequences of complacency is to invest some effort and do the diligence even if there are not any major changes happening in any given quarter, so that's what I'll be doing from now on with this stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between Trump and Big Tech, including Apple. The attendance of Tim Cook at Trump's inauguration suggests a willingness to engage positively with the administration, which could be perceived as favorable for Apple's business environment. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny could create uncertainty. Overall, the positive engagement may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses an investor's reflections on past investing mistakes, including complacency regarding Apple (AAPL). While the article acknowledges Apple's strengths (brand, products, growth potential), it also points out that its growth rate has slowed relative to other companies and that it faces market saturation. The author admits to complacency and plans to be more diligent in the future. This is a slightly negative signal, as it suggests that the investor's initial bullish thesis may need re-evaluation. However, the article also states that Apple is still a favorable investment. The inclusion of past 'Double Down' recommendations from the Motley Fool, including Apple, is a subtle attempt to maintain a positive outlook. Overall, the news is mildly negative, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise in the short term. The article is more about general investing principles than a specific negative catalyst for Apple.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article highlights Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, suggesting an attempt to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.  However, the article's focus is broader, covering the general relationship between Trump and Big Tech, and also mentions ongoing legal challenges facing large tech companies.  The connection between Cook's attendance and a direct impact on Apple's stock price is weak.  The article doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's business or financials. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction. The probability of price movement is largely attributed to other market factors not mentioned in this news piece.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to stay in favor. Historically, Trump's administration has been critical of Big Tech, but this gesture could imply reduced regulatory risks or favorable policies for Apple. However, the news also mentions ongoing legal challenges like antimonopoly cases, which could pose risks. The market might view Cook's attendance positively, interpreting it as a strategic move to mitigate regulatory pressures. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the perceived reduction in immediate regulatory threats.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes, one of which involves Apple Inc. (AAPL). The author mentions holding Apple for a long time and notes that while the company's performance over the last 10 years has been impressive, it has not been spectacular compared to other companies, and there are potential headwinds due to market penetration and competition. However, the author concludes that Apple is still a favorable investment. The news does not contain any directly negative or positive revelations about Apple's future prospects, but rather a personal reflection on investment strategies. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral, with a slight bias towards a positive view as the author still considers it a favorable investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses three subtle investing mistakes made by the author, including not updating the investment thesis in a timely fashion, assuming the best outcome would occur, and complacency. The article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) as an example of a company where the author was complacent and assumed the boom times would continue forever. However, the article also notes that Apple's quarterly revenue and free cash flow have grown significantly over the last 10 years, but at a slower pace than some other companies. The author concludes that they will invest more effort in doing diligence on Apple's stock, even in the absence of major changes. Based on this analysis, the news is neutral to slightly positive for Apple's stock, as the author is acknowledging the need to be more vigilant but still considers the company a favorable investment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration suggesting a desire to maintain a positive relationship. This could be interpreted as a reduction in regulatory risks for Apple, which is generally favorable for the stock. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the positive implications of Cook's attendance may outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise, but the mixed signals suggest a cautious outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses an investor's reflections on past investing mistakes, including complacency regarding Apple (AAPL).

However, the article also states that Apple is still a favorable investment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there is a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a slight rise and others towards a slight fall. Given the slightly negative sentiment in the article and the mixed opinions in previous rounds, I will adjust the probabilities slightly downwards.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news piece is largely tangential to Apple's stock price. While Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration might be interpreted as a gesture of goodwill towards the administration, the article doesn't offer any concrete information about potential policy changes affecting Apple.  The mention of ongoing legal challenges for Big Tech is generic and doesn't specifically target Apple.  The overall tone is neutral.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with some leaning slightly positive and others slightly negative.  Given the lack of direct impact from the news, and the neutral to slightly positive sentiment from previous models, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but the difference is marginal.  The majority of price movement will likely be driven by broader market factors.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.

While it acknowledges Apple's strengths, such as its brand, products, and growth potential, it also points out that the company's growth rate has slowed relative to others and that it faces market saturation and competition. However, the author still considers Apple a favorable investment.

This suggests a strategic effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration, which could potentially lead to favorable regulatory policies or reduced regulatory risks for Apple. While the news itself does not directly relate to Apple's financial performance or business operations, it implies a positive sentiment towards Apple. However, the probability of a significant stock price movement based solely on this news is relatively low. The mixed signals provided by different models suggest a balanced view, with a slight positive bias.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, particularly with Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration, which may signal a desire to maintain a positive relationship and potentially reduce regulatory risks for Apple. However, the mention of ongoing legal challenges and antitrust scrutiny introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, but the presence of regulatory concerns tempers this optimism. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions but lean slightly positive, I estimate a probability of 0.55 for a price rise and 0.45 for a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news article discusses an investor's reflections on investing mistakes, including complacency regarding Apple.

This is a mixed signal. Considering previous predictions, there's a slight downward trend in the probability of a price rise. The article's focus on past mistakes and the need for more diligence suggests a slightly negative outlook, but the continued favorable view tempers this. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.53, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.47, Reasoning: The news is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price. While Tim Cook's attendance at Trump's inauguration could be interpreted positively (reduced regulatory risk), the news lacks concrete details about Apple's financials or business prospects.  The mention of broader legal challenges facing Big Tech is generic and doesn't directly impact Apple.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight bias towards a price rise, but the overall consensus is that the impact of this news is minimal.  Therefore, the probability of a price movement is primarily driven by other market factors not mentioned in the news.  Considering the previous rounds' predictions and the lack of significant positive or negative news directly affecting Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the slight positive bias in previous predictions, but the probabilities remain close to neutral.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential shift in the relationship between President Trump and Big Tech, with Apple's CEO Tim Cook attending Trump's inauguration, signaling an effort to maintain a positive relationship with the administration.
