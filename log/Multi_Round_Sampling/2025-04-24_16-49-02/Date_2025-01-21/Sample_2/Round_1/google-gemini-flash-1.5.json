(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jefferies Cuts Apple Rating, Flags iPhone Weakness and Slower AI Growth\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares continue to decline following a Jefferies downgrade to Underperform from Hold, driven by concerns about slowing iPhone demand and broader consumer electronics headwinds. The firm also cut its price target to $200.75 from $211.84.\n\nJefferies analysts, led by Edison Lee, predict Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target of 5% and guide for minimal growth in Q2, falling below consensus estimates. Slower AI adoption and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for future iPhones add to the concern.\n\nNew data from IDC shows iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, while subsidies in China are expected to exclude most iPhone models due to pricing limits, potentially dampening demand. Meanwhile, Apple's budget iPhone SE4 may face tough competition from used iPhone Pro models and Android alternatives, limiting its potential.\n\nAs of 11:07 AM ET, Apple shares traded at $221.25, down 3.80%, reflecting growing investor worries. Earlier in premarket trading, shares were already down 2%. Apple is set to report its fiscal Q1 earnings on January 30, with expectations closely watched amid these challenges.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights both positive and negative aspects regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company has shown financial growth with a revenue increase and is launching new products with AI features, which could attract investor interest. On the other hand, the mention of billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumping some tech stocks, including AAPL, may raise concerns among investors about the stock's future performance. However, the overall positive outlook on Apple's innovations and financials suggests a higher likelihood of stock price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Two downgrades from reputable firms (Jefferies and Loop Capital) citing weak iPhone sales and a lack of AI traction are significant. The specific concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, overall market share decline, and lower revenue forecasts all point to potential downward pressure on the stock. While new product releases are mentioned, their impact is uncertain and doesn't outweigh the immediate negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% midday Tuesday confirms the market's initial negative reaction. The underperformance of Apple stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further strengthens the bearish outlook. The upcoming earnings report on Jan 30th will be crucial, but the lowered expectations set by Jefferies suggest a higher likelihood of a negative surprise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jefferies, a reputable financial firm, has downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' citing concerns about weakening iPhone demand, slower-than-expected AI adoption, and challenges in its advanced packaging roadmap.  These concerns are supported by IDC data showing a 4% year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments and the potential impact of Chinese subsidy policies.  The lowered price target of $200.75 from $211.84 further reinforces a bearish outlook. While Apple's Q1 earnings report could potentially offer a counter-narrative, the current news strongly suggests a negative market reaction. The pre-market and current trading day's price drop of approximately 3.8% already reflects a significant portion of this negative sentiment. However, it's important to note that market reactions can be unpredictable, and positive surprises or other market factors could influence the stock price.  Therefore, while the probability of a price fall is higher, a complete disregard for the possibility of a rise is unwarranted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock, which the author believes was a mistake given GM's strong performance, including a 55% increase in stock price post-sale, better-than-expected earnings, increased market share, and aggressive share buybacks. The author highlights GM's resilience, positive earnings guidance, and strategic pivot in autonomous technology as reasons for optimism. However, the article does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), as the focus is on GM. The mention of Buffett reducing Berkshire's stake in Apple is tangential and does not provide new negative information about Apple's fundamentals. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses billionaire Chen Tianqiao's investment activities, specifically mentioning Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the stocks in his portfolio. Shanda Asset Management holds a $116.5 million stake in AAPL. The article highlights Apple's positive financial growth, upcoming product launches with AI features, and collaborations with OpenAI. These factors are likely to be viewed positively by investors. However, the article also mentions that AAPL ranks 3rd on the list of stocks Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on, suggesting that Chen might be reducing his exposure to AAPL. The overall sentiment seems mixed but slightly positive due to the emphasis on AI innovations and financial growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Apple's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into its products and its transformation as a services provider could boost consumer demand and enhance brand loyalty. Additionally, Apple's world-leading capital-return program has provided significant value to shareholders. However, the article also notes that Apple stock is historically pricey relative to its trailing-12-month EPS, which might be a concern for value investors. Given the positive outlook from the analyst and the company's strong fundamentals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple downgrades and lowered price targets due to weak iPhone sales and lackluster AI performance. Analysts expect lower-than-anticipated financial results, and current market trends show a negative sentiment towards the stock. The recent stock price drop further indicates investor concerns. While new product rollouts might provide some upside, the immediate impact of the negative news outweighs any potential positive developments.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
