(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock hit with 2 downgrades on weak iPhone sales, AI outlook\nNews Content: Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights both positive and negative aspects regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company has shown financial growth with a revenue increase and is launching new products with AI features, which could attract investor interest. On the other hand, the mention of billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumping some tech stocks, including AAPL, may raise concerns among investors about the stock's future performance. However, the overall positive outlook on Apple's innovations and financials suggests a higher likelihood of stock price increase compared to a decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Two downgrades from reputable firms (Jefferies and Loop Capital) citing weak iPhone sales and a lack of AI traction are significant. The specific concerns about declining iPhone sales in China, overall market share decline, and lower revenue forecasts all point to potential downward pressure on the stock. While new product releases are mentioned, their impact is uncertain and doesn't outweigh the immediate negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% midday Tuesday confirms the market's initial negative reaction. The underperformance of Apple stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further strengthens the bearish outlook. The upcoming earnings report on Jan 30th will be crucial, but the lowered expectations set by Jefferies suggest a higher likelihood of a negative surprise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: Jefferies, a reputable financial firm, has downgraded Apple's rating to 'Underperform' citing concerns about weakening iPhone demand, slower-than-expected AI adoption, and challenges in its advanced packaging roadmap.  These concerns are supported by IDC data showing a 4% year-over-year decline in iPhone shipments and the potential impact of Chinese subsidy policies.  The lowered price target of $200.75 from $211.84 further reinforces a bearish outlook. While Apple's Q1 earnings report could potentially offer a counter-narrative, the current news strongly suggests a negative market reaction. The pre-market and current trading day's price drop of approximately 3.8% already reflects a significant portion of this negative sentiment. However, it's important to note that market reactions can be unpredictable, and positive surprises or other market factors could influence the stock price.  Therefore, while the probability of a price fall is higher, a complete disregard for the possibility of a rise is unwarranted.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock, which the author believes was a mistake given GM's strong performance, including a 55% increase in stock price post-sale, better-than-expected earnings, increased market share, and aggressive share buybacks. The author highlights GM's resilience, positive earnings guidance, and strategic pivot in autonomous technology as reasons for optimism. However, the article does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL), as the focus is on GM. The mention of Buffett reducing Berkshire's stake in Apple is tangential and does not provide new negative information about Apple's fundamentals. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses billionaire Chen Tianqiao's investment activities, specifically mentioning Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of the stocks in his portfolio. Shanda Asset Management holds a $116.5 million stake in AAPL. The article highlights Apple's positive financial growth, upcoming product launches with AI features, and collaborations with OpenAI. These factors are likely to be viewed positively by investors. However, the article also mentions that AAPL ranks 3rd on the list of stocks Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on, suggesting that Chen might be reducing his exposure to AAPL. The overall sentiment seems mixed but slightly positive due to the emphasis on AI innovations and financial growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). According to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives, Apple's integration of artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into its products and its transformation as a services provider could boost consumer demand and enhance brand loyalty. Additionally, Apple's world-leading capital-return program has provided significant value to shareholders. However, the article also notes that Apple stock is historically pricey relative to its trailing-12-month EPS, which might be a concern for value investors. Given the positive outlook from the analyst and the company's strong fundamentals, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights multiple downgrades and lowered price targets due to weak iPhone sales and lackluster AI performance. Analysts expect lower-than-anticipated financial results, and current market trends show a negative sentiment towards the stock. The recent stock price drop further indicates investor concerns. While new product rollouts might provide some upside, the immediate impact of the negative news outweighs any potential positive developments.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company has shown financial growth with a revenue increase and is launching new products with AI features, which could attract investor interest. However, the mention of billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumping some tech stocks, including AAPL, raises concerns about the stock's future performance. Additionally, there are significant bearish sentiments from other analysts regarding weak iPhone sales and AI adoption. Given the conflicting signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive aspects of financial growth and product innovation, but the overall sentiment remains cautious due to the negative news surrounding the stock.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Two downgrades from reputable firms (Jefferies and Loop Capital) citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of traction in AI are significant concerns. The lowered price targets reinforce this bearish outlook. The article also highlights declining iPhone market share and lower revenue forecasts. While new product releases are mentioned, their potential impact is overshadowed by the immediate negative sentiment. The stock's recent drop of 3.7% confirms the market's initial negative reaction. The underperformance of Apple stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further strengthens the bearish outlook. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a clear consensus forming towards a negative outlook, with the majority of models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. The negative information outweighs any potential positive catalysts in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  Jefferies' downgrade to 'Underperform', coupled with the cited reasons (slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected AI adoption, and challenges in advanced packaging), paints a bearish picture.  The IDC data supporting the iPhone shipment decline and the potential impact of Chinese subsidies further strengthens this negative outlook. The pre-market and intraday price drop of approximately 3.8% reflects the immediate market reaction to this negative news. While Apple's Q1 earnings could potentially offer a positive surprise, the current information strongly suggests a higher probability of a price fall.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a price fall, particularly those models that directly analyze the provided news.  My prediction incorporates this consensus and the weight of the negative news presented.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article primarily discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock and the author's disagreement with this move, highlighting GM's strong performance post-sale. While the article mentions Buffett reducing Berkshire's stake in Apple (AAPL), it does not provide any new negative information about Apple's fundamentals or performance. The focus remains on GM, and the tangential mention of Apple is unlikely to significantly impact AAPL's stock price. Given the lack of direct negative or positive news about Apple, the stock price is expected to remain relatively stable with a slight bias towards stability or minor fluctuations.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses billionaire Chen Tianqiao's investment activities, specifically mentioning Apple Inc.

Considering the mixed signals, the overall sentiment seems slightly positive due to the emphasis on AI innovations and financial growth, but cautious due to the potential reduction in stake by a significant investor.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses three Warren Buffett stocks with potential upside in 2025, including Apple Inc.

Taking into account the trend of others' beliefs and the provided information, I lean towards a slightly positive outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and lowered price targets due to weak iPhone sales and lackluster AI performance. Analysts expect lower-than-anticipated financial results, and current market trends show a negative sentiment towards the stock. The recent stock price drop further indicates investor concerns.
