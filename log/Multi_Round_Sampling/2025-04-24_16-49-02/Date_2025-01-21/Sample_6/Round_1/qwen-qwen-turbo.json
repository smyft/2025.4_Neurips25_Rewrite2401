      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Shares Tumble 4% After Double Downgrades by Analysts\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financial) shares tumbled more than 4% on Tuesday after analysts across the board downgraded the stock, citing mounting worries about sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services.\n\nApple was downgraded to underperform from hold by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who cut his price target to $200.75 from $211.84. However, Lee said the downgrade reflected weakening demand for the iPhone, particularly in major foreign markets such as China. However, efforts to boost sales with new models, such as the budget-friendly iPhone SE, have not really gotten buy-in in an increasingly crowded smartphone market, which has raised doubts about revenue growth.\n\nLast week, Barclays also downgraded Apple to an underweight from an equal weight rating, warning of poor iPhone 15 sales and anticipating more of the same with the iPhone 16. It also long condemned Apple's product lineup as not innovative enough, which, he said, had dulled consumer interest and buying momentum.\n\nApple's hardware business, of course, extends beyond smartphones, and it also has headwinds. Declining sales of MacBooks and iPads were also a long pointer to bigger problems in the company's hardware arm, a historically lucrative revenue generator.\n\nGrowing skepticism of Apple's ability to keep its growth well intact in the face of changing market conditions led to these downgrades. Meanwhile, analysts remain wary of Apple's near-term performance as it grapples with intensifying competition and economic pressures, a selling factor in recent weakness.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline poses a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which may indicate uncertainty among investors. If the market perceives that Apple is losing its competitive edge, it could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and historical performance may mitigate this risk. Overall, the lack of definitive positive news suggests a higher probability of a price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization is a symbolic blow. More importantly, the Jefferies downgrade to \"Underperform\" citing weak iPhone 17/18 sales expectations and concerns about iPhone SE 4 demand are significant negative catalysts. The reported decline in iPhone shipments and weak sales in China further reinforce the bearish outlook. While Apple Intelligence is mentioned, the analysts' skepticism about its immediate impact and the comparison to used iPhone 13 models suggest it's not seen as a strong driver of sales. Therefore, the negative factors outweigh any potential positives.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Apple in relation to Barclays potentially taking over its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs, this is indirect and doesn't provide a direct impact assessment on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to predicting Apple's stock price movement. Any price movement in AAPL would be due to other market factors and not this specific news.  We assume a neutral probability distribution based on the lack of relevant information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade in Apple's stock rating by Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and reduced demand ahead of the iPhone 17. Additionally, the stock has already experienced a significant drop (4.1% in the morning session and 3.2% by close) due to this news and previous concerns about declining market share in China. The market's reaction suggests that the news is meaningful but not fundamentally altering the perception of Apple's business. Given the negative sentiment and the recent downward trend in Apple's stock price, the probability of further decline is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock, which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article mentions that Buffett has been a net seller of stocks, including a massive stake in Apple. The article's positive outlook on GM does not directly impact AAPL's stock price. Given that the news does not provide specific information about Apple, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the article will likely have a more significant impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's plans to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which could potentially compete with Apple's products. However, the article does not provide any direct negative information about Apple or its products. Instead, it highlights Meta's efforts to expand its product line and compete in the market. As a result, the news may have a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased competition, but the effect is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
