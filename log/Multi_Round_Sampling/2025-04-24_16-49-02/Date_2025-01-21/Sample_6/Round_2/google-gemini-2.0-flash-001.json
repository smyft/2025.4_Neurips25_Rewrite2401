(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline poses a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which may indicate uncertainty among investors. If the market perceives that Apple is losing its competitive edge, it could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and historical performance may mitigate this risk. Overall, the lack of definitive positive news suggests a higher probability of a price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization is a symbolic blow. More importantly, the Jefferies downgrade to \"Underperform\" citing weak iPhone 17/18 sales expectations and concerns about iPhone SE 4 demand are significant negative catalysts. The reported decline in iPhone shipments and weak sales in China further reinforce the bearish outlook. While Apple Intelligence is mentioned, the analysts' skepticism about its immediate impact and the comparison to used iPhone 13 models suggest it's not seen as a strong driver of sales. Therefore, the negative factors outweigh any potential positives.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Apple in relation to Barclays potentially taking over its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs, this is indirect and doesn't provide a direct impact assessment on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to predicting Apple's stock price movement. Any price movement in AAPL would be due to other market factors and not this specific news.  We assume a neutral probability distribution based on the lack of relevant information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade in Apple's stock rating by Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and reduced demand ahead of the iPhone 17. Additionally, the stock has already experienced a significant drop (4.1% in the morning session and 3.2% by close) due to this news and previous concerns about declining market share in China. The market's reaction suggests that the news is meaningful but not fundamentally altering the perception of Apple's business. Given the negative sentiment and the recent downward trend in Apple's stock price, the probability of further decline is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock, which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article mentions that Buffett has been a net seller of stocks, including a massive stake in Apple. The article's positive outlook on GM does not directly impact AAPL's stock price. Given that the news does not provide specific information about Apple, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the article will likely have a more significant impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's plans to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which could potentially compete with Apple's products. However, the article does not provide any direct negative information about Apple or its products. Instead, it highlights Meta's efforts to expand its product line and compete in the market. As a result, the news may have a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased competition, but the effect is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline raises a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which suggests uncertainty and potential concerns among investors. Previous predictions indicate a bearish sentiment due to downgrades from analysts citing weak iPhone sales and market share issues. The overall trend from previous rounds shows a consistent belief that negative factors outweigh any positives, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. Given the context of the news and the prevailing market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization is a significant event, indicating a shift in market sentiment. The Jefferies downgrade to \"Underperform\" is a strong negative signal, citing concerns about weak iPhone 17/18 sales and iPhone SE 4 demand. The reported decline in iPhone shipments and weak sales in China further reinforce the bearish outlook. While Apple Intelligence is mentioned, the analysts' skepticism about its immediate impact suggests it's not seen as a strong driver of sales. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a consistent bearish sentiment towards Apple. The models have generally predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the continued negative news and analyst downgrades, I believe the probability of a further decline is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  The mention of Apple is tangential, relating to a potential shift in Apple's credit card partnership. This indirect connection is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models highlighting negative news affecting Apple unrelated to this article.  Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple in this news, and the conflicting previous predictions based on other news, I assign a near-neutral probability to both price increase and decrease.  The slight lean towards a price fall reflects the overall uncertainty and the possibility of negative market sentiment impacting Apple, independent of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative sentiment around Apple Inc. (AAPL), including downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and reduced demand ahead of the iPhone 17. Additionally, the stock has already experienced a notable drop (4.1% in the morning session and 3.2% by close) due to this news and previous concerns about declining market share in China. The market's reaction suggests that the news is meaningful but not fundamentally altering the perception of Apple's business. Given the negative sentiment and the recent downward trend in Apple's stock price, the probability of further decline is higher than a rise in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also largely favor a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a probability of 0.5 or higher for a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock, expressing a positive outlook on GM's future performance. However, the article does not provide any direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The only relevant connection is that Buffett has also been a net seller of stocks, including a massive stake in Apple. Given that the news does not provide specific information about Apple, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the article will likely have a more significant impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, a neutral prediction is reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's plans to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which could potentially compete with Apple's products. This increased competition may have a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any direct negative information about Apple or its products, and the company's strong brand loyalty and historical performance may mitigate this risk. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various factors, including increased competition and negative sentiment, I will estimate the probability of the stock price rising as lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news indicates multiple downgrades by analysts, citing concerns about sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a higher probability of a stock price decline, primarily due to negative market sentiment and deteriorating business metrics. This news reinforces the bearish outlook as it highlights ongoing challenges in major markets and declining sales of key products like iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
