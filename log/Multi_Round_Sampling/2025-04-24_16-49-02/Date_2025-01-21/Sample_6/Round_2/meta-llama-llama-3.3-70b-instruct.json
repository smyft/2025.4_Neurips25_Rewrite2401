(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The headline poses a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which may indicate uncertainty among investors. If the market perceives that Apple is losing its competitive edge, it could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and historical performance may mitigate this risk. Overall, the lack of definitive positive news suggests a higher probability of a price decline compared to a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization is a symbolic blow. More importantly, the Jefferies downgrade to \"Underperform\" citing weak iPhone 17/18 sales expectations and concerns about iPhone SE 4 demand are significant negative catalysts. The reported decline in iPhone shipments and weak sales in China further reinforce the bearish outlook. While Apple Intelligence is mentioned, the analysts' skepticism about its immediate impact and the comparison to used iPhone 13 models suggest it's not seen as a strong driver of sales. Therefore, the negative factors outweigh any potential positives.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Apple in relation to Barclays potentially taking over its credit card partnership with Goldman Sachs, this is indirect and doesn't provide a direct impact assessment on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to predicting Apple's stock price movement. Any price movement in AAPL would be due to other market factors and not this specific news.  We assume a neutral probability distribution based on the lack of relevant information.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights a downgrade in Apple's stock rating by Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and reduced demand ahead of the iPhone 17. Additionally, the stock has already experienced a significant drop (4.1% in the morning session and 3.2% by close) due to this news and previous concerns about declining market share in China. The market's reaction suggests that the news is meaningful but not fundamentally altering the perception of Apple's business. Given the negative sentiment and the recent downward trend in Apple's stock price, the probability of further decline is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock, which is not directly related to Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article mentions that Buffett has been a net seller of stocks, including a massive stake in Apple. The article's positive outlook on GM does not directly impact AAPL's stock price. Given that the news does not provide specific information about Apple, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the article will likely have a more significant impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's plans to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which could potentially compete with Apple's products. However, the article does not provide any direct negative information about Apple or its products. Instead, it highlights Meta's efforts to expand its product line and compete in the market. As a result, the news may have a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased competition, but the effect is likely to be minimal. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline raises a question about Apple's status as a market leader, which suggests uncertainty and potential concerns among investors. Previous predictions indicate a bearish sentiment due to downgrades from analysts citing weak iPhone sales and market share issues. The overall trend from previous rounds shows a consistent belief that negative factors outweigh any positives, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. Given the context of the news and the prevailing market sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization is a significant event, indicating a shift in market sentiment. The Jefferies downgrade to \"Underperform\" is a strong negative signal, citing concerns about weak iPhone 17/18 sales and iPhone SE 4 demand. The reported decline in iPhone shipments and weak sales in China further reinforce the bearish outlook. While Apple Intelligence is mentioned, the analysts' skepticism about its immediate impact suggests it's not seen as a strong driver of sales. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a consistent bearish sentiment towards Apple. The models have generally predicted a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the continued negative news and analyst downgrades, I believe the probability of a further decline is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  The mention of Apple is tangential, relating to a potential shift in Apple's credit card partnership. This indirect connection is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models highlighting negative news affecting Apple unrelated to this article.  Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple in this news, and the conflicting previous predictions based on other news, I assign a near-neutral probability to both price increase and decrease.  The slight lean towards a price fall reflects the overall uncertainty and the possibility of negative market sentiment impacting Apple, independent of this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative sentiment around Apple Inc. (AAPL), including downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and reduced demand ahead of the iPhone 17.

The market's reaction suggests that the news is meaningful but not fundamentally altering the perception of Apple's business. Given the negative sentiment and the recent downward trend in Apple's stock price, the probability of further decline is higher than a rise in the short term. Previous predictions from other models also largely favor a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a probability of 0.5 or higher for a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article discusses Warren Buffett's decision to sell General Motors (GM) stock, expressing a positive outlook on GM's future performance. However, the article does not provide any direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). The only relevant connection is that Buffett has also been a net seller of stocks, including a massive stake in Apple. Given that the news does not provide specific information about Apple, the probabilities of AAPL's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively low. The overall market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the article will likely have a more significant impact on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, a neutral prediction is reasonable.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses Meta's plans to release new wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, which could potentially compete with Apple's products. This increased competition may have a slight negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, the article does not provide any direct negative information about Apple or its products, and the company's strong brand loyalty and historical performance may mitigate this risk. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various factors, including increased competition and negative sentiment, I will estimate the probability of the stock price rising as lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The financial news indicates multiple downgrades by analysts, citing concerns about sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a higher probability of a stock price decline, primarily due to negative market sentiment and deteriorating business metrics. This news reinforces the bearish outlook as it highlights ongoing challenges in major markets and declining sales of key products like iPhones, MacBooks, and iPads.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
