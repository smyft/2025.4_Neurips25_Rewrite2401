(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Loses Top-Stock Crown as Analysts Downgrade on iPhone Risk\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. received a pair of analyst downgrades, in the latest sign that soft iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors, as artificial intelligence fails to act as a hoped-for growth catalyst.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nShares fell 3.2% on Tuesday, closing at its lowest since November amid a rocky start to the year. The stock is down 11% in January, putting it on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. It has dropped 14% from a December peak.\n\nThe day erased more than $110 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization, enough for it to close under Nvidia Corp. in size for the first time since November. Apple now has a valuation of $3.35 trillion, compared with $3.45 trillion for the AI-focused chipmaker.\n\nThe company was downgraded to hold at Loop Capital and cut to underperform at Jefferies, which became a rare firm with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. Just 8.5% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a bearish rating, while about 63% have the equivalent of a buy.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee writes that recent weakness in iPhone sales has been worse than expected, with the China market a particular concern. Independent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nCiting a third-party survey, Lee added that \u201cUS consumers do not yet find smartphone AI useful,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cunlikely to kickstart a super upgrade cycle anytime soon.\u201d Given these trends, he wrote, Apple\u2019s March quarter guidance could disappoint.\n\nSeparately, Loop expects a \u201cmaterial iPhone demand reduction\u201d beginning in the March quarter \u201cbut materially amplifying\u201d in the subsequent two quarters. While the drivers of the firm\u2019s former buy rating could still materialize, analyst Ananda Baruah wrote, \u201cit certainly won\u2019t be for the next nine months given we\u2019re on the front end of 2.5 Q\u2019s of materially softening iPhone demand.\u201d\n\nApple is scheduled to report its first-quarter results next week.\n\nWith the downgrades, Apple\u2019s recommendation consensus \u2014 a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings \u2014 stands at 4.02 out of five, its lowest since May, and down from an August peak of about 4.3. Just over 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a rate well below other megacap tech stocks, where the percentage of buy ratings tops 80% or even 90%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoffettNathanson downgraded the stock earlier this month, citing concerns in China and the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso on Monday, Morgan Stanley named Seagate Technology its top pick among IT hardware names, replacing Apple.\n\n(Updates to market close, adds market cap detail.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant downgrade of Apple's stock rating by Jefferies, citing weak sales expectations for upcoming iPhone models and a decline in iPhone shipments. The overall market sentiment appears negative, especially with Apple's stock already down over 9% this year. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is high, while the probability of it rising is low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate negative sentiment towards Apple due to slowing growth in China and uncertainty surrounding their AI initiatives. Downgrades from Wall Street firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies are a strong negative signal. The analyst's comments about increased competition in China and the 'wait-and-see' scenario further reinforce this negative outlook. While AI is mentioned as a potential future positive, it's currently in early stages and not expected to provide immediate gains. The need for a 'hardware cycle' to excite investors suggests a lack of near-term catalysts. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The headline \"Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?\" is a question, not a statement of fact.  It suggests uncertainty about Apple's continued dominance. This type of headline is unlikely to cause a significant immediate price movement in either direction.  The lack of specific information regarding Apple's performance, financials, or future prospects makes it difficult to predict a directional move.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral stance, reflecting the ambiguity of the headline.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Jefferies analysts to 'Underperform', expectations of weak sales for upcoming iPhone models (17 and 18), and declining iPhone shipments, particularly in China. Additionally, the news mentions that Apple's stock has already fallen by 4% on the day and is down 9% year-to-date. The lack of significant hardware upgrades and consumer traction for Apple Intelligence are also cited as concerns. Given these factors, the sentiment around Apple's stock appears bearish in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by analysts due to concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in China. The downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies, along with a third-party survey indicating that US consumers do not find smartphone AI useful, have led to a 3.2% drop in Apple's stock price. Given that 63% of analysts still have a buy rating and only 8.5% have a bearish rating, there is a mixed sentiment. However, the recent weakness in iPhone sales and the potential for disappointing guidance in the March quarter suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. The significant drop in market capitalization and the stock's 11% decline in January further support this outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article discusses Billionaire Chen Tianqiao's investment activities, including his stake in Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the article mentions that Chen's hedge fund, Shanda Asset Management, has a $116.5 million stake in AAPL, it does not indicate a significant change in his investment position. The article highlights AAPL's financial growth, new iPhone SE model with AI features, and collaboration with OpenAI, which are positive factors. However, it also mentions that the author's conviction lies in other stocks that may deliver higher returns. Given the neutral to slightly positive tone of the article, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates multiple downgrades and concerns about weak iPhone sales and revenue expectations, which are likely to have a negative impact on investor sentiment. Despite the market's volatility and historical trends suggesting potential buying opportunities after significant drops, the current negative outlook from analysts is likely to outweigh positive factors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant downgrade of Apple's stock rating by Jefferies, highlighting concerns over weak sales expectations for upcoming iPhone models and a decline in iPhone shipments, particularly in China. The overall market sentiment appears negative, with Apple's stock already down over 9% this year. Analysts are cautious about demand for the rumored iPhone SE 4, and the lack of significant hardware upgrades is likely to deter consumer interest. Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is high, while the probability of it rising is low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news clearly indicates a bearish sentiment towards Apple due to slowing growth in China, downgrades from Wall Street firms (Loop Capital and Jefferies), and uncertainty surrounding their AI initiatives. While the analyst mentions potential in AI, it's still in early stages. The need for a 'hardware cycle' to excite investors suggests a lack of near-term positive catalysts. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, the consensus leans towards a negative outlook. The initial predictions were heavily skewed towards a price fall, and while some models showed a slightly more balanced view, the overall sentiment remains negative. Therefore, I will maintain a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is inherently ambiguous and doesn't provide concrete information about Apple's financial performance.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future prospects.  While several models point to negative factors like weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, others highlight potential positives such as AI initiatives and continued market dominance.  The lack of specific, new information in the provided headline makes it difficult to definitively predict a price movement.  Considering the overall sentiment from previous predictions, which leans slightly negative but with significant disagreement, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the prevailing concerns about slowing growth and negative analyst sentiment. However, the uncertainty remains high.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a significant downgrade by Jefferies to 'Underperform', weak sales expectations for upcoming iPhone models (17 and 18), declining iPhone shipments (especially in China), and a lack of consumer traction for Apple Intelligence. Additionally, Apple's stock has already fallen by 4% on the day and is down 9% year-to-date. The overall sentiment is bearish, with multiple analysts expressing caution. While there is some historical precedent for buying opportunities after significant drops, the current negative outlook and lack of near-term catalysts suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate negative sentiment towards Apple due to slowing growth in China and uncertainty surrounding their AI initiatives. Downgrades from Wall Street firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies are a strong negative signal. The analyst's comments about increased competition in China and the 'wait-and-see' scenario further reinforce this negative outlook. While AI is mentioned as a potential future positive, it's currently in early stages and not expected to provide immediate gains. The need for a 'hardware cycle' to excite investors suggests a lack of near-term catalysts. Given that Apple's stock has already dropped significantly and multiple analysts have downgraded the stock, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but not extremely high due to the potential for rebound.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Billionaire Chen Tianqiao's investment activities, including his stake in Apple Inc.

Despite the market's volatility and historical trends suggesting potential buying opportunities after significant drops, the current negative outlook from analysts is likely to outweigh positive factors. The news also reflects ongoing challenges in the Chinese market, where Apple has faced significant competition. The overall sentiment from multiple models indicates a bearish outlook, with some models suggesting a neutral stance, but the majority leaning towards a negative sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.9, Reasoning: The news indicates a significant downgrade of Apple's stock rating by Jefferies, highlighting concerns over weak sales expectations for upcoming iPhone models and a decline in iPhone shipments, particularly in China.

The analyst's comments about increased competition in China and the 'wait-and-see' scenario further reinforce this negative outlook. While AI is mentioned as a potential future positive, it's currently in early stages and not expected to provide immediate gains. The need for a 'hardware cycle' to excite investors suggests a lack of near-term catalysts. Considering the previous rounds' predictions, the consensus leans heavily towards a negative outlook. The majority of models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling, and the trend has been consistent across multiple rounds. Therefore, I am maintaining a high probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is vague and doesn't provide concrete information to predict price movement.  However, the previous predictions reveal a strong bearish sentiment driven by several factors: weak iPhone sales (particularly in China), analyst downgrades (Jefferies, Loop Capital), concerns about the lack of significant hardware upgrades and consumer interest in Apple's AI initiatives.  While some models point to potential positives (Chen Tianqiao's investment, AI collaborations), the weight of negative news and consistent bearish predictions across multiple rounds outweighs these positives.  The initial strong negative sentiment has persisted, with only minor adjustments in subsequent rounds.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the prevailing negative sentiment and lack of strong positive catalysts.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors for Apple Inc.
