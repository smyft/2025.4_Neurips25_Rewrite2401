(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target of $325, indicating a potential upside of 41% by 2025. The integration of AI solutions and the growth of its services segment are expected to enhance consumer demand and brand loyalty. However, the article also notes that Warren Buffett has reduced his stake in Apple, which may raise concerns among value investors. Overall, the positive analyst sentiment and growth prospects suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity markets ended higher on Tuesday as markets digested President Trump's inauguration. This suggests a positive market sentiment overall. Since Apple is a major player in the US equity market, a general rise in the market is likely to positively influence its stock price. However, the provided news snippet is very brief and lacks specific details about the reasons for the market rise or any specific impact on Apple. Therefore, while a rise is more probable, the probability isn't overwhelmingly high. The lack of detail also means a fall is still possible, though less likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's advancements in wearable technology, including smart glasses and potentially a smartwatch and earbuds, which directly compete with Apple's existing product lines (Apple Watch and AirPods).  While Meta's progress is noteworthy, it's unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term.  Apple's established brand loyalty, extensive ecosystem, and existing market dominance in these areas suggest that Meta's new products will face a considerable challenge in gaining significant market share.  The news is more relevant to Meta's stock price than Apple's.  Any impact on AAPL would likely be indirect and minimal, possibly even slightly positive if investors view it as increased competition stimulating innovation within the wearable tech sector.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the potential for positive indirect effects, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a reported 18% plunge in iPhone sales in China, loss of market share to Huawei, and downgrades by two major banks (Jefferies and Loop Capital). Jefferies cited weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and skepticism about the usefulness of Apple's AI, while Loop Capital predicted further demand declines. These factors collectively suggest strong downward pressure on AAPL's stock price in the near term. While Apple's long-term potential remains, the immediate market reaction is likely negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price fell even as the overall market rallied. This suggests that there might be company-specific factors contributing to the decline, which could be perceived as negative for the stock. However, the fact that the market rallied implies that the overall sentiment is positive, which might mitigate some of the negative impacts on Apple's stock. Given this mixed information, I would estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling, but not extreme, as the market's overall rally could support a recovery.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article mentions that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on Tuesday as markets digested President Donald Trump's initial actions. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which could have a favorable impact on the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article does not provide specific information about Apple's performance or any company-specific news. Given the general positive market trend, it is likely that Apple's stock price will also rise. Nevertheless, without specific news about the company, the probability of a stock price rise is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news from Jefferies includes a downgrade of Apple's rating and a reduction in their price target, which has led to a decline in Apple's stock price. Concerns over weakening iPhone demand and slower AI growth have been expressed, alongside a prediction that Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target. Additionally, recent data showing a decrease in iPhone shipments and potential competition from used iPhone models and Android alternatives further complicate the outlook. These factors suggest a negative sentiment among investors.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target of $325, indicating a potential upside of 41% by 2025. The integration of AI solutions and the growth of its services segment are expected to enhance consumer demand and brand loyalty. However, the article also notes that Warren Buffett has reduced his stake in Apple, which may raise concerns among value investors. Despite this, the overall sentiment from analysts remains positive, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The initial news headline suggests a positive market sentiment due to Trump's inauguration, which could benefit Apple. However, the news content is inaccessible without a subscription, limiting specific insights. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, influenced by various factors like analyst ratings, iPhone sales data, and competition. The most recent predictions lean heavily towards a price decrease due to negative news regarding iPhone sales, AI skepticism, and downgrades. Given the limited positive information and the strong negative sentiment from recent predictions, I will adjust my prediction towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not as extreme as some previous predictions, considering the initial positive market sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's products.  While this could be seen as a negative for Apple in the long term, the impact is likely to be minimal in the short term. Apple's strong brand loyalty and established market position provide a significant buffer. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock price.  Some models point to negative factors like weakening iPhone sales (not mentioned in this news), while others emphasize the overall positive market sentiment. This news itself is largely neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as increased competition is not inherently positive. However, the lack of direct negative impact on Apple's financials or market share makes a significant price drop unlikely.  Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the relatively neutral nature of this specific news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the overall market sentiment, but the difference is small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a reported 18% plunge in iPhone sales in China, loss of market share to Huawei, and downgrades by two major banks (Jefferies and Loop Capital).

These factors collectively suggest strong downward pressure on AAPL's stock price in the near term. While Apple's long-term potential remains, the immediate market reaction is likely negative. Previous predictions also largely favor a stock price fall, with most models assigning higher probabilities to a decline.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price fell even as the market rallied, suggesting company-specific factors contributed to the decline. However, the overall positive market sentiment could mitigate some negative impacts. Various predictions from previous models indicate a range of probabilities, with some citing positive growth prospects and others highlighting negative developments such as declining iPhone sales and downgrades by major banks. Considering the mixed information, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity markets ended higher on Tuesday as markets digested President Donald Trump's inauguration, suggesting a positive market sentiment. However, the provided news snippet is very brief and lacks specific details about the reasons for the market rise or any specific impact on Apple. Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating positive information and others indicating negative information, the overall trend seems to be slightly positive but with significant uncertainty. Given the general positive market trend and the lack of specific negative news about Apple, it is likely that Apple's stock price will also rise, but the probability is not extremely high due to the uncertainty and mixed signals from other predictions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple Inc., including a downgrade from Jefferies, concerns about iPhone demand, and slower AI growth. These factors align with predictions from multiple models suggesting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Previous predictions from models like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and qwen/qwen-turbo indicate a strong likelihood of negative sentiment among investors. While there is some positive market sentiment mentioned in other predictions, the overwhelming focus on negative developments for Apple outweighs those sentiments.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target of $325, indicating a potential upside of 41% by 2025. The integration of AI solutions and the growth of its services segment are expected to enhance consumer demand and brand loyalty. However, the article also notes that Warren Buffett has reduced his stake in Apple, which may raise concerns among value investors. Despite this, the overall sentiment from analysts remains positive, suggesting a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall. Previous predictions show a mix of sentiments, with some indicating strong negative factors like declining iPhone sales and downgrades, while others emphasize the positive market sentiment and growth potential. Balancing these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but with significant uncertainty due to the mixed signals.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The initial news headline suggests a positive market sentiment due to Trump's inauguration. However, the news content is inaccessible without a subscription, limiting specific insights about Apple. The previous rounds show a trend of decreasing probability of stock price rise, influenced by negative factors like iPhone sales data, AI skepticism, and downgrades. Given the limited positive information and the strong negative sentiment from recent predictions, I will adjust my prediction towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not as extreme as some previous predictions, considering the initial positive market sentiment. The trend of previous predictions is more important than the initial headline.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's products. This is a long-term threat, but the short-term impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Apple's strong brand, ecosystem, and market dominance provide a significant buffer.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting uncertainty. Some models highlight negative factors like weakening iPhone sales (not mentioned in this news), while others emphasize the overall positive market sentiment. This news is largely neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as increased competition isn't inherently positive. However, the lack of direct negative impact on Apple's financials makes a significant price drop unlikely. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the relatively neutral nature of this specific news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the overall market sentiment, but the difference is small.  The weight of previous predictions, many of which cite negative factors unrelated to this news, influences my assessment towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, but the difference is marginal.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative developments for Apple Inc.

Considering the mixed information, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly higher probability of it falling. The recent negative news and downgrades have a significant impact on the sentiment, but the overall market rally provides a counterbalance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed sentiment regarding the stock price movement of Apple Inc. (AAPL). The initial news headline suggests a positive market sentiment due to President Donald Trump's inauguration, which could benefit Apple.

These concerns are echoed in several previous predictions where models consistently assigned higher probabilities of the stock price falling due to negative developments. While the market sentiment can play a role, the specific negative news about Apple's iPhone sales and AI growth expectations suggest a strong downward pressure on the stock price.\nRound: 3\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc.

However, the key piece of information is that the news content is inaccessible without a subscription. The trend in previous rounds shows a shift towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, driven by concerns about declining iPhone sales, AI skepticism, and downgrades from major banks. While the initial headline might suggest a positive influence, the consistent negative sentiment expressed in the previous rounds, based on more specific negative news about Apple, outweighs the general market sentiment. Therefore, I will predict a higher probability of the stock price falling, aligning with the trend of negative assessments in the previous rounds.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's expansion into wearable technology, directly competing with Apple's products.

However, the previous predictions show a strong trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, primarily due to concerns about weakening iPhone sales, AI skepticism, and downgrades from financial analysts.  These negative factors, unrelated to the Meta news, significantly outweigh the potential for a short-term negative impact from increased competition. While the overall market sentiment might offer some support, the weight of evidence from previous predictions and the negative news about Apple's performance points towards a higher likelihood of a price fall.
