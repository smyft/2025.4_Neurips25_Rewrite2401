      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jefferies Cuts Apple Rating, Flags iPhone Weakness and Slower AI Growth\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares continue to decline following a Jefferies downgrade to Underperform from Hold, driven by concerns about slowing iPhone demand and broader consumer electronics headwinds. The firm also cut its price target to $200.75 from $211.84.\n\nJefferies analysts, led by Edison Lee, predict Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target of 5% and guide for minimal growth in Q2, falling below consensus estimates. Slower AI adoption and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for future iPhones add to the concern.\n\nNew data from IDC shows iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, while subsidies in China are expected to exclude most iPhone models due to pricing limits, potentially dampening demand. Meanwhile, Apple's budget iPhone SE4 may face tough competition from used iPhone Pro models and Android alternatives, limiting its potential.\n\nAs of 11:07 AM ET, Apple shares traded at $221.25, down 3.80%, reflecting growing investor worries. Earlier in premarket trading, shares were already down 2%. Apple is set to report its fiscal Q1 earnings on January 30, with expectations closely watched amid these challenges.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target of $325, indicating a potential upside of 41% by 2025. The integration of AI solutions and the growth of its services segment are expected to enhance consumer demand and brand loyalty. However, the article also notes that Warren Buffett has reduced his stake in Apple, which may raise concerns among value investors. Overall, the positive analyst sentiment and growth prospects suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that US equity markets ended higher on Tuesday as markets digested President Trump's inauguration. This suggests a positive market sentiment overall. Since Apple is a major player in the US equity market, a general rise in the market is likely to positively influence its stock price. However, the provided news snippet is very brief and lacks specific details about the reasons for the market rise or any specific impact on Apple. Therefore, while a rise is more probable, the probability isn't overwhelmingly high. The lack of detail also means a fall is still possible, though less likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on Meta's advancements in wearable technology, including smart glasses and potentially a smartwatch and earbuds, which directly compete with Apple's existing product lines (Apple Watch and AirPods).  While Meta's progress is noteworthy, it's unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term.  Apple's established brand loyalty, extensive ecosystem, and existing market dominance in these areas suggest that Meta's new products will face a considerable challenge in gaining significant market share.  The news is more relevant to Meta's stock price than Apple's.  Any impact on AAPL would likely be indirect and minimal, possibly even slightly positive if investors view it as increased competition stimulating innovation within the wearable tech sector.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the potential for positive indirect effects, but the overall impact is expected to be small.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative developments for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a reported 18% plunge in iPhone sales in China, loss of market share to Huawei, and downgrades by two major banks (Jefferies and Loop Capital). Jefferies cited weaker-than-expected iPhone sales and skepticism about the usefulness of Apple's AI, while Loop Capital predicted further demand declines. These factors collectively suggest strong downward pressure on AAPL's stock price in the near term. While Apple's long-term potential remains, the immediate market reaction is likely negative.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple's stock price fell even as the overall market rallied. This suggests that there might be company-specific factors contributing to the decline, which could be perceived as negative for the stock. However, the fact that the market rallied implies that the overall sentiment is positive, which might mitigate some of the negative impacts on Apple's stock. Given this mixed information, I would estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling, but not extreme, as the market's overall rally could support a recovery.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article mentions that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on Tuesday as markets digested President Donald Trump's initial actions. This suggests a positive market sentiment, which could have a favorable impact on the stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the article does not provide specific information about Apple's performance or any company-specific news. Given the general positive market trend, it is likely that Apple's stock price will also rise. Nevertheless, without specific news about the company, the probability of a stock price rise is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news from Jefferies includes a downgrade of Apple's rating and a reduction in their price target, which has led to a decline in Apple's stock price. Concerns over weakening iPhone demand and slower AI growth have been expressed, alongside a prediction that Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target. Additionally, recent data showing a decrease in iPhone shipments and potential competition from used iPhone models and Android alternatives further complicate the outlook. These factors suggest a negative sentiment among investors.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
