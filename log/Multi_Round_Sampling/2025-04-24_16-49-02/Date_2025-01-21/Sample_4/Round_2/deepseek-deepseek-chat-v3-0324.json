(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock hit with 2 downgrades on weak iPhone sales, AI outlook\nNews Content: Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Barclays' price target being raised, which is a positive indicator for Barclays itself, not directly for Apple Inc. However, the mention of Apple in the context of Barclays' credit card partnership suggests that any positive sentiment towards Barclays could indirectly benefit Apple. Given that the news is generally positive for Barclays and could imply a stronger financial environment for partnerships, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. However, since the news is not directly about Apple, the probabilities are moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two analysts downgraded the stock due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue miss in Q1'2025. The article also highlights a recent drop in iPhone shipments in China, a significant market for Apple. While the article mentions the stock market sometimes overreacts and presents buying opportunities, the overall sentiment is bearish. The stock has already fallen 3.2% today and is down 8.8% YTD. Given these factors, the probability of further decline is higher than a rise in the short term. The article also mentions that the market considers this news meaningful, which suggests the downward trend may continue. The fact that the stock is already down 14.2% from its 52-week high suggests that the market has already priced in some of the negative sentiment, but the downgrades and China sales data are new negative catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Apple in relation to Barclays' potential credit card partnership, the price target change for Barclays has no direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving up or down due to this news is extremely low, primarily influenced by other market factors unrelated to this specific announcement.  Any movement would likely be due to general market trends or other news related to Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant downgrades from two analysts due to weak iPhone sales and a lackluster AI outlook, particularly in China, which is a critical market for Apple. The downgrades and revised price targets suggest lowered expectations for Apple's near-term performance. Additionally, the reported decline in iPhone market share and revenue forecasts further support a bearish outlook. While upcoming product launches like the new iPhone SE and MacBook Airs could provide some upside, the immediate impact of the negative news and analyst sentiment is likely to weigh more heavily on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today' suggests that Apple's stock price declined despite a broader market rally. This implies that there were company-specific factors or negative sentiments that led to the decline. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling because the news indicates a downward movement. However, since the market rallied, it suggests overall positive economic conditions, which could potentially mitigate the decline or support a recovery. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is not negligible but is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on the day when President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a positive sentiment in the market, which may positively impact individual stocks including Apple Inc. However, the news does not specifically mention Apple or any factors directly affecting the company's performance. Therefore, while the overall market trend is positive, the specific impact on Apple's stock price cannot be definitively determined from this information alone.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Barclays' price target being raised, which is a positive indicator for Barclays itself. However, the mention of Apple in the context of Barclays' credit card partnership suggests that any positive sentiment towards Barclays could indirectly benefit Apple. Despite this, the overall sentiment surrounding Apple is mixed due to recent downgrades and concerns about weak iPhone sales, particularly in China. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of AAPL's stock price rising, but the bearish sentiment from other analysts weighs heavily, leading to a higher probability of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Two analysts downgraded Apple due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue miss. The article highlights a recent drop in iPhone shipments in China, a significant market for Apple. The stock has already fallen 3.2% today and is down 8.8% YTD. The previous predictions also lean towards a negative outlook, with most models assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. Considering the consistent negative sentiment and the actual price drop, I expect the stock to continue falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a price target increase for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  The connection to Apple is tenuous, mentioning a potential credit card partnership.  While a stronger Barclays could indirectly benefit Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal and overshadowed by other factors affecting Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement based solely on this news.  Given the weak connection and the potential for other market forces to dominate, the probability of a significant price change in either direction due to this news is low.  I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a rise, reflecting the generally positive sentiment implied by the Barclays price target increase, but acknowledging the indirect nature of the relationship.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant downgrades from two analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital) due to weak iPhone sales and a lackluster AI outlook, particularly in China, which is a critical market for Apple. The downgrades and revised price targets suggest lowered expectations for Apple's near-term performance. Additionally, the reported decline in iPhone market share and revenue forecasts further support a bearish outlook. While upcoming product launches like the new iPhone SE and MacBook Airs could provide some upside, the immediate impact of the negative news and analyst sentiment is likely to weigh more heavily on the stock price. The stock has already fallen 3.7% midday on Tuesday, indicating a negative market reaction. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any factors that would specifically impact its stock price. The news focuses on the appointment of Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, as the interim chairman of the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the potential implications for tech regulation. However, it does mention that the CMA has been preparing a probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Additionally, the threat of a trade war with the US due to differences in competition rules could also affect Apple. Given the lack of directly positive news and the potential for negative regulatory actions, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today' suggests a negative sentiment towards Apple despite a broader market rally. Analyzing the previous predictions, most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to negative factors such as weak iPhone sales, downgrades from analysts, and a decline in iPhone market share. However, some models also consider the overall positive market conditions and potential for recovery. Given the predominantly bearish sentiment and company-specific negative factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Nevertheless, the probabilities are not extremely high due to the potential for market recovery and the indirect positive impact of overall market conditions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates that US equities markets ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a generally positive sentiment in the market. However, the news content does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.'s performance or any direct factors impacting the company. While the overall market trend is positive, the specific impact on Apple's stock price remains uncertain. Previous predictions from various models suggest a mix of sentiments, with some models predicting a higher probability of stock price falling due to negative sentiments about iPhone sales and downgrades. Considering all these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but the overall sentiment remains somewhat cautious.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
