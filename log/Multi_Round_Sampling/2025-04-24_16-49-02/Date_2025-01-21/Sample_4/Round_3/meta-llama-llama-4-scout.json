(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Labour installs Amazon man at CMA as Trump threatens tech war\nNews Content: Doug Gurr ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022 - Shutterstock\n\nThe chairman of Britain\u2019s competition regulator has been ousted and replaced with a veteran Amazon executive as Donald Trump threatens a trade war with countries that seek to curb US tech giants.\n\nMinisters last night appointed Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022, as interim chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nHe will replace Marcus Bokkerink, who is leaving just three years into a five-year term at the watchdog, after an intervention from Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary.\n\nIt is understood his exit is intended to signal that the Government is serious about its efforts to unlock growth, as the CMA has in recent years been attacked for attempting to halt a wide range of deals.\n\nThis includes an effort to block Microsoft\u2019s $69bn (\u00a356bn) takeover of gaming company Activision in 2023, which led to the former\u2019s boss Brad Smith claiming his confidence in the UK had been left \u201cseverely shaken\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, under Mr Gurr, Amazon accused the CMA of a \u201cspeculative\u201d effort to block a minority investment in the UK\u2019s Deliveroo in 2018.\n\nFive years later, Will Shu, Deliveroo chief executive, claimed the watchdog was \u201ctrying to kill companies\u201d.\n\nIndustry sources said the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink, a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, could serve to \u201creassure\u201d the technology sector and say \u201cwe\u2019re taking growth seriously\u201d.\n\nHowever, they also pointed to the fact that Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, has ultimate day-to-day responsibility for the regulator, raising questions over how she will collaborate with Mr Gurr.Sarah Cardell will retain overall responsibility for running the CMA - Betty Laura Zapata/Bloomberg\n\nClash with White House\n\nThe unexpected departure of Mr Bokkerink comes as Britain risks a clash with Mr Trump\u2019s new White House regime over its stance on global competition rules.\n\nThe CMA has already announced an investigation into Google over its search dominance this year, while The Telegraph understands it also has been preparing a second probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores.\n\nMarc Andreessen, who donated to Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, last week said there were \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in the UK on competition rules, claiming they were \u201cextremely draconian, anti-tech, anti-business, anti-American policies\u201d.\n\nBrussels regulators have reportedly put major decisions on investigations into Apple, Meta and Google on hold \u2013 in part to assess the temperature of the Trump administration.\n\nCristina Caffarra, a competition economist, said: \u201cIf anyone tried anything that had the potential to make real change, we now know there would be unknown retribution as Trump has indicated he would protect American platforms from Europe, and they bent the knee.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cThere were four men [Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai] in the front row [at Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration] worth nearly a trillion dollars, it\u2019s very clear he will protect them in some way.\u201dTech bosses Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration - Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP Photo\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said that Labour\u2019s decision to appoint Mr Gurr in the name of growth \u201cseems odd when they are simultaneously appointing their trade union and party donors elsewhere\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, it comes as the Government faces calls to refer the attempted takeover of The Telegraph by an Abu Dhabi fund to the CMA as a breach of legislation banning foreign state ownership of newspapers.\n\nAn investigation of the potential threat to press freedom was paused last year to allow RedBird IMI, which had acquired an option on ownership, to secure an onward sale.\n\nThe process has failed to deliver a transaction, chiefly owing to Abu Dhabi\u2019s price expectations, and RedBird IMI recently urged Telegraph executives to make job cuts and abandon editorial investments prompting a demand for action this week from Sir Ian Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader.\n\nHe accused the Government of \u201cfoot-dragging\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to upset the UAE.\u201d\n\nA request for the CMA to complete the investigation could allow Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, to order The Telegraph\u2019s independent directors to sell the company at a market price to any acceptable buyer.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink. A government spokesman declined to comment. The CMA was contacted for comment.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Barclays' price target being raised, which is a positive indicator for Barclays itself, not directly for Apple Inc. However, the mention of Apple in the context of Barclays' credit card partnership suggests that any positive sentiment towards Barclays could indirectly benefit Apple. Given that the news is generally positive for Barclays and could imply a stronger financial environment for partnerships, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising. However, since the news is not directly about Apple, the probabilities are moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Two analysts downgraded the stock due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue miss in Q1'2025. The article also highlights a recent drop in iPhone shipments in China, a significant market for Apple. While the article mentions the stock market sometimes overreacts and presents buying opportunities, the overall sentiment is bearish. The stock has already fallen 3.2% today and is down 8.8% YTD. Given these factors, the probability of further decline is higher than a rise in the short term. The article also mentions that the market considers this news meaningful, which suggests the downward trend may continue. The fact that the stock is already down 14.2% from its 52-week high suggests that the market has already priced in some of the negative sentiment, but the downgrades and China sales data are new negative catalysts.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.05, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.05, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Deutsche Bank raising its price target for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  While the article mentions Apple in relation to Barclays' potential credit card partnership, the price target change for Barclays has no direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving up or down due to this news is extremely low, primarily influenced by other market factors unrelated to this specific announcement.  Any movement would likely be due to general market trends or other news related to Apple itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant downgrades from two analysts due to weak iPhone sales and a lackluster AI outlook, particularly in China, which is a critical market for Apple. The downgrades and revised price targets suggest lowered expectations for Apple's near-term performance. Additionally, the reported decline in iPhone market share and revenue forecasts further support a bearish outlook. While upcoming product launches like the new iPhone SE and MacBook Airs could provide some upside, the immediate impact of the negative news and analyst sentiment is likely to weigh more heavily on the stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today' suggests that Apple's stock price declined despite a broader market rally. This implies that there were company-specific factors or negative sentiments that led to the decline. Given this context, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling because the news indicates a downward movement. However, since the market rallied, it suggests overall positive economic conditions, which could potentially mitigate the decline or support a recovery. Thus, the probability of the stock price rising is not negligible but is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that US benchmark equity indexes ended higher on the day when President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a positive sentiment in the market, which may positively impact individual stocks including Apple Inc. However, the news does not specifically mention Apple or any factors directly affecting the company's performance. Therefore, while the overall market trend is positive, the specific impact on Apple's stock price cannot be definitively determined from this information alone.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Barclays' price target being raised, which is a positive indicator for Barclays itself. However, the mention of Apple in the context of Barclays' credit card partnership suggests that any positive sentiment towards Barclays could indirectly benefit Apple. Despite this, the overall sentiment surrounding Apple is mixed due to recent downgrades and concerns about weak iPhone sales, particularly in China. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of AAPL's stock price rising, but the bearish sentiment from other analysts weighs heavily, leading to a higher probability of falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Two analysts downgraded Apple due to concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue miss. The article highlights a recent drop in iPhone shipments in China, a significant market for Apple. The stock has already fallen 3.2% today and is down 8.8% YTD. The previous predictions also lean towards a negative outlook, with most models assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. Considering the consistent negative sentiment and the actual price drop, I expect the stock to continue falling in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a price target increase for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL).  The connection to Apple is tenuous, mentioning a potential credit card partnership.  While a stronger Barclays could indirectly benefit Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal and overshadowed by other factors affecting Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement based solely on this news.  Given the weak connection and the potential for other market forces to dominate, the probability of a significant price change in either direction due to this news is low.  I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a rise, reflecting the generally positive sentiment implied by the Barclays price target increase, but acknowledging the indirect nature of the relationship.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant downgrades from two analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital) due to weak iPhone sales and a lackluster AI outlook, particularly in China, which is a critical market for Apple. The downgrades and revised price targets suggest lowered expectations for Apple's near-term performance. Additionally, the reported decline in iPhone market share and revenue forecasts further support a bearish outlook. While upcoming product launches like the new iPhone SE and MacBook Airs could provide some upside, the immediate impact of the negative news and analyst sentiment is likely to weigh more heavily on the stock price. The stock has already fallen 3.7% midday on Tuesday, indicating a negative market reaction. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL) or any factors that would specifically impact its stock price. The news focuses on the appointment of Doug Gurr, a former Amazon executive, as the interim chairman of the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), and the potential implications for tech regulation. However, it does mention that the CMA has been preparing a probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores. This regulatory scrutiny could potentially have a negative impact on Apple's stock price. Additionally, the threat of a trade war with the US due to differences in competition rules could also affect Apple. Given the lack of directly positive news and the potential for negative regulatory actions, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline 'Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today' suggests a negative sentiment towards Apple despite a broader market rally. Analyzing the previous predictions, most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to negative factors such as weak iPhone sales, downgrades from analysts, and a decline in iPhone market share. However, some models also consider the overall positive market conditions and potential for recovery. Given the predominantly bearish sentiment and company-specific negative factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Nevertheless, the probabilities are not extremely high due to the potential for market recovery and the indirect positive impact of overall market conditions.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news headline indicates that US equities markets ended higher on the day President Donald Trump took office. This suggests a generally positive sentiment in the market. However, the news content does not provide specific details about Apple Inc.'s performance or any direct factors impacting the company. While the overall market trend is positive, the specific impact on Apple's stock price remains uncertain. Previous predictions from various models suggest a mix of sentiments, with some models predicting a higher probability of stock price falling due to negative sentiments about iPhone sales and downgrades. Considering all these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but the overall sentiment remains somewhat cautious.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Barclays' price target increase, which is a positive indicator for Barclays but does not directly impact Apple. However, the mention of Apple in the context of a potential credit card partnership with Barclays suggests that any positive sentiment towards Barclays could indirectly benefit Apple. Despite this, there are significant concerns regarding Apple's performance, particularly due to recent downgrades related to weak iPhone sales and market share losses, especially in China. This mixed sentiment leads to a higher probability of AAPL's stock price falling, as the bearish outlook from analysts weighs more heavily than the indirect positive implications from the Barclays news.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative, with two analyst downgrades citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and a potential revenue miss.

The trend of previous predictions also indicates a consistently negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.1, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news article focuses on a price target increase for Barclays (BCS), not Apple (AAPL). The connection to Apple is extremely weak, mentioning only a potential credit card partnership.  While a stronger Barclays *could* indirectly benefit Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal and easily overshadowed by other factors affecting Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show significant disagreement, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement based solely on this news.  The majority of previous predictions lean towards a higher probability of a price fall for Apple, citing concerns about weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades.  Given the weak connection between the news and Apple, and the prevailing negative sentiment towards Apple in other news, the probability of a significant price change in either direction due to *this* news is low.  I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to no change, reflecting the minimal indirect relationship and the overall uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant downgrades from two analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital) due to weak iPhone sales and a lackluster AI outlook, particularly in China, which is a critical market for Apple.
