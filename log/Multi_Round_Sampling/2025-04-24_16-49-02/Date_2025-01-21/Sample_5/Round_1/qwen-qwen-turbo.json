Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024.

Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry.\n\nIn 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Shanda Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nShanda Asset Management's Stake: $116.5 million\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company demonstrates several qualities that make it a solid investment pick. The first factor that may attract great investment is the company\u2019s financial growth, as reported in the third quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% from a year ago and the cash dividend was $0.25 per share of the company\u2019s common stock. The second great factor that may attract investment is the production of the new iPhone SE model, which is being prepared for an early 2025 launch that will include artificial intelligence (AI) features. Moreover, the company has collaborated with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT technology into its devices, which will enhance app personalization and user experience. Lastly, the integration of Apple Intelligence into a broader range of devices, including the iPhone SE 4, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, also holds great investment potential.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by two analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple's near-term performance, particularly due to disappointing iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market. The downgrade from hold to underperform and the lowered price targets suggest that analysts expect further weakness in Apple's stock. Additionally, concerns about the company's ability to capitalize on AI and the high valuation relative to its growth prospects add to the bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate negative sentiment towards Apple due to slowing growth in China and uncertainty surrounding their AI initiatives. Downgrades from Wall Street firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies are a strong negative signal. The analyst's comments about increased competition in China and the 'wait-and-see' scenario further reinforce this negative outlook. While AI is mentioned as a potential future positive, it's currently in early stages and not expected to provide immediate gains. The need for a 'hardware cycle' to excite investors suggests a lack of near-term catalysts. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  Analyst downgrades from Jefferies (to underperform) and Loop Capital (to hold) further amplify negative sentiment.  The cited 18.2% drop in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter and the belief that AI features won't drive significant upgrades are major headwinds.  While 63% of analysts still have a buy rating, the shift towards a more bearish outlook (8.5% bearish rating, down from a higher percentage previously), coupled with the recent stock price decline and the loss of its top-stock crown to Nvidia, suggests a higher probability of further price drops in the short term.  The upcoming earnings report next week will be crucial, but the current negative sentiment and concerns about weakening demand make a price increase less likely in the immediate future.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Jefferies analysts to 'Underperform' due to expected misses in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, weak projected sales for iPhone 17 and 18, and declining iPhone shipments, particularly in China. Additionally, Apple's stock has already fallen by 4% on the day of the news and is down more than 9% year-to-date. The lack of significant hardware upgrades and consumer traction for Apple Intelligence further dampen prospects. Given these bearish indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. This sale by a high-profile figure could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence in Apple stock. However, it's essential to note that Pelosi's trading activity is not necessarily a direct reflection of her views on the company's future performance, and her actions could be influenced by various factors. The sale of Apple shares while purchasing call options in Alphabet and Amazon might suggest a rotation out of Apple and into other tech giants, which could have a neutral or slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the success of Apple TV+ series 'Severance' with a $200 million income from its first season, indicating a positive performance for Apple's streaming platform. Additionally, the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso' and its significant income contribution over its three-year run further supports the growth of Apple's streaming services. This positive news suggests an increased likelihood of the stock price rising due to the potential for increased revenue and growth in Apple's streaming segment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that despite Chen Tianqiao potentially reducing his stake in Apple Inc., the company remains a solid investment with positive growth indicators such as increased revenue, upcoming AI innovations in new product lines, and strategic partnerships with tech leaders like OpenAI. The news does not present any negative implications for the company's future performance, suggesting that the overall sentiment remains bullish.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
