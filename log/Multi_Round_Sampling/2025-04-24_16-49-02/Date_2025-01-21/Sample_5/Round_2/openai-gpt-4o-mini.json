      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Apple Fell Even as the Market Rallied Today\nNews Content: Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The downgrade by two analysts, Jefferies and Loop Capital, indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple's near-term performance, particularly due to disappointing iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market. The downgrade from hold to underperform and the lowered price targets suggest that analysts expect further weakness in Apple's stock. Additionally, concerns about the company's ability to capitalize on AI and the high valuation relative to its growth prospects add to the bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate negative sentiment towards Apple due to slowing growth in China and uncertainty surrounding their AI initiatives. Downgrades from Wall Street firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies are a strong negative signal. The analyst's comments about increased competition in China and the 'wait-and-see' scenario further reinforce this negative outlook. While AI is mentioned as a potential future positive, it's currently in early stages and not expected to provide immediate gains. The need for a 'hardware cycle' to excite investors suggests a lack of near-term catalysts. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news indicates significant concerns regarding Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  Analyst downgrades from Jefferies (to underperform) and Loop Capital (to hold) further amplify negative sentiment.  The cited 18.2% drop in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter and the belief that AI features won't drive significant upgrades are major headwinds.  While 63% of analysts still have a buy rating, the shift towards a more bearish outlook (8.5% bearish rating, down from a higher percentage previously), coupled with the recent stock price decline and the loss of its top-stock crown to Nvidia, suggests a higher probability of further price drops in the short term.  The upcoming earnings report next week will be crucial, but the current negative sentiment and concerns about weakening demand make a price increase less likely in the immediate future.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Jefferies analysts to 'Underperform' due to expected misses in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, weak projected sales for iPhone 17 and 18, and declining iPhone shipments, particularly in China. Additionally, Apple's stock has already fallen by 4% on the day of the news and is down more than 9% year-to-date. The lack of significant hardware upgrades and consumer traction for Apple Intelligence further dampen prospects. Given these bearish indicators, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold Apple Inc. (AAPL) shares, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. This sale by a high-profile figure could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence in Apple stock. However, it's essential to note that Pelosi's trading activity is not necessarily a direct reflection of her views on the company's future performance, and her actions could be influenced by various factors. The sale of Apple shares while purchasing call options in Alphabet and Amazon might suggest a rotation out of Apple and into other tech giants, which could have a neutral or slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights the success of Apple TV+ series 'Severance' with a $200 million income from its first season, indicating a positive performance for Apple's streaming platform. Additionally, the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso' and its significant income contribution over its three-year run further supports the growth of Apple's streaming services. This positive news suggests an increased likelihood of the stock price rising due to the potential for increased revenue and growth in Apple's streaming segment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that despite Chen Tianqiao potentially reducing his stake in Apple Inc., the company remains a solid investment with positive growth indicators such as increased revenue, upcoming AI innovations in new product lines, and strategic partnerships with tech leaders like OpenAI. The news does not present any negative implications for the company's future performance, suggesting that the overall sentiment remains bullish.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The recent downgrades by Jefferies and Loop Capital indicate a significant negative sentiment towards Apple's near-term performance, particularly due to disappointing iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market. The analysts' revisions of shipment forecasts and concerns about the company's ability to leverage AI for growth further contribute to a bearish outlook. Given the current market conditions, the high valuation of Apple relative to its growth prospects, and the recent decline in stock price, the probability of the stock price falling is considerably higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The current news focuses on analyst downgrades due to slowing growth in China and uncertainty around AI initiatives. This is a negative signal. Previous rounds of predictions also leaned bearish, with most models assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. While some models in round 0 were bullish based on unrelated news, the consensus based on the current news and the trend of previous predictions is bearish. Therefore, I will assign a higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative.  Analyst downgrades from Jefferies (to underperform) and Loop Capital (to hold) are significant bearish signals.  The reported decline in iPhone sales, especially in the crucial Chinese market, is a major concern.  While some analysts maintain a buy rating, the shift towards a more bearish consensus, coupled with the recent stock price drop and loss of its top-stock position, points to a higher probability of further price declines in the short term. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial, but the current negative sentiment and weakening demand make a price increase less likely in the immediate future.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a higher probability of a price fall.  My prediction incorporates this information and the weight of the negative news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors for Apple Inc. (AAPL), including a downgrade by Jefferies to 'Underperform' due to expected misses in fiscal first quarter results and guidance, weak projected sales for iPhone 17 and 18, and declining iPhone shipments, particularly in China. Additionally, Apple's stock has already fallen by 4% on the day of the news and is down more than 9% year-to-date. The lack of significant hardware upgrades and consumer traction for Apple Intelligence further dampen prospects. Given these bearish indicators and the consensus from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Nancy Pelosi sold 31,600 shares of Apple Inc. (AAPL) valued between $5 million and $25 million. This sale by a high-profile figure could be perceived as a negative signal by the market, potentially leading to a decrease in investor confidence in Apple stock. Additionally, Pelosi's simultaneous purchase of call options in Alphabet and Amazon might suggest a rotation out of Apple and into other tech giants, which could have a neutral or slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, it's essential to note that Pelosi's trading activity is not necessarily a direct reflection of her views on the company's future performance, and her actions could be influenced by various factors. Considering these aspects, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about Apple TV+ expanding its streaming dominance with the $200 million success of 'Severance' Season 1 and the potential for a fourth season of 'Ted Lasso' indicates a positive performance for Apple's streaming platform. This positive news suggests an increased likelihood of the stock price rising due to the potential for increased revenue and growth in Apple's streaming segment. However, considering the previous predictions from other models, which indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling due to various negative factors such as disappointing iPhone sales and challenges in the Chinese market, the overall sentiment is still somewhat bearish. Therefore, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
