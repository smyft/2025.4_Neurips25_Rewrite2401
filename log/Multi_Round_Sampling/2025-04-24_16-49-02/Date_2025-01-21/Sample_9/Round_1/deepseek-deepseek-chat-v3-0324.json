(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Jefferies Cuts Apple Rating, Flags iPhone Weakness and Slower AI Growth\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares continue to decline following a Jefferies downgrade to Underperform from Hold, driven by concerns about slowing iPhone demand and broader consumer electronics headwinds. The firm also cut its price target to $200.75 from $211.84.\n\nJefferies analysts, led by Edison Lee, predict Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target of 5% and guide for minimal growth in Q2, falling below consensus estimates. Slower AI adoption and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for future iPhones add to the concern.\n\nNew data from IDC shows iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, while subsidies in China are expected to exclude most iPhone models due to pricing limits, potentially dampening demand. Meanwhile, Apple's budget iPhone SE4 may face tough competition from used iPhone Pro models and Android alternatives, limiting its potential.\n\nAs of 11:07 AM ET, Apple shares traded at $221.25, down 3.80%, reflecting growing investor worries. Earlier in premarket trading, shares were already down 2%. Apple is set to report its fiscal Q1 earnings on January 30, with expectations closely watched amid these challenges.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance, which could lead to negative sentiment among investors. However, the overall market reaction to her trading activities can be mixed, as her trades have historically garnered attention and speculation. The fact that she is reallocating her investments into other tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon could indicate a strategic shift rather than a negative outlook on Apple itself. Therefore, while there is a potential for a decline in stock price due to her selling activity, the overall impact may be mitigated by broader market trends and investor sentiment towards tech stocks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline indicates that Apple's stock price fell while the overall market rallied. This suggests company-specific negative factors are at play, outweighing any positive market sentiment. Without knowing the specific reasons *why* Apple fell, it's difficult to give a precise probability. However, the fact that it moved contrary to the market trend is a bearish signal. I'm assuming the news content elaborates on the reasons for the fall, which are likely negative. Therefore, the probability of a further fall is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article expresses a pessimistic outlook on Apple's short-term stock performance.  While the upcoming Q1 earnings report is crucial, the author believes that even a positive report is unlikely to significantly boost the stock price due to already high expectations and a relatively high P/E ratio.  The article highlights concerns about stagnant revenue growth, diminishing returns from share buybacks, and increasing competition.  The author's prediction is based on these factors and the current market sentiment, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price remaining flat or falling slightly, rather than experiencing a significant rise. The promotional section at the end is irrelevant to the analysis of the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies to Underperform, concerns about slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth, slower AI adoption, and competitive pressures in China and the budget segment. The stock has already declined by 3.80% following the news, indicating strong negative sentiment. Given the combination of downgrades, lowered price targets, and fundamental challenges, the probability of further stock price decline is high in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's stock price has been declining due to concerns over iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. The company's stock has dropped 11% in January and 14% from its December peak. Analysts have expressed concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in China, and have cited weak demand and high competition as reasons for the downgrades. With 8.5% of analysts having a bearish rating and only 60% recommending the stock, the sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. Additionally, Apple's market capitalization has dropped below that of Nvidia Corp., and the stock has closed at its lowest since November. Given these factors, it is likely that the stock price will continue to decline in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company has experienced stagnant revenue growth over the past few years, and the article suggests that Apple needs to change the narrative around its stock. The article also mentions that Wall Street analysts aren't expecting a lot from Apple in Q1, with projected 3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth. Given the high expectations and the company's history of stagnant growth, the article concludes that investors should not buy Apple stock before Jan. 30. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news describes Meta Platforms Inc.'s plans to expand its range of wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, with a focus on embedding artificial intelligence features. This initiative could lead to increased competition with Apple Inc., particularly in the smartwatch and wireless earbuds market. However, it also represents an effort by Meta to establish itself as a major player in the AI-driven hardware space. Although this could be seen as a positive for Meta, it might create uncertainty for Apple investors regarding the long-term competitiveness of their products.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
