(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\nNews Content: Nancy Pelosi Sells Nvidia, Apple And Loads Up On Google-Parent Alphabet And Amazon Calls\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has executed a series of significant technology stock trades valued at over $30 million, according to recent congressional disclosure reports, while recovering from a hip injury sustained during an official trip to Luxembourg.\n\nWhat Happened: Pelosi\u2019s latest trading activity includes substantial positions in major tech companies through options contracts. On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge. Despite the injury, her investment activities have remained active.\n\nTrending: CEO of Integris gathered a team of senior investment managers who have $34.22 billion in combined owned and managed assets in the West Coast \u2014 here\u2019s how to invest in their private credit fund that targets 12% annual interest rate.\n\nWhy It Matters: The trades have drawn attention following reports that a Nancy Pelosi stock tracker delivered 54% gains in 2024, outperforming most hedge funds and even the popular Inverse Cramer Stock Tracker. The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) stock sales that preceded a Department of Justice lawsuit against the company. Pelosi\u2019s spokesperson has consistently maintained that all trades comply with federal disclosure requirements under the STOCK Act.\n\nRead Next:\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder Jeff Bezos holds over $70 million in art \u2014 this alternative asset has outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, delivering an average annual return of 11.4%.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance, which could lead to negative sentiment among investors. However, the overall market reaction to her trading activities can be mixed, as her trades have historically garnered attention and speculation. The fact that she is reallocating her investments into other tech giants like Alphabet and Amazon could indicate a strategic shift rather than a negative outlook on Apple itself. Therefore, while there is a potential for a decline in stock price due to her selling activity, the overall impact may be mitigated by broader market trends and investor sentiment towards tech stocks.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline indicates that Apple's stock price fell while the overall market rallied. This suggests company-specific negative factors are at play, outweighing any positive market sentiment. Without knowing the specific reasons *why* Apple fell, it's difficult to give a precise probability. However, the fact that it moved contrary to the market trend is a bearish signal. I'm assuming the news content elaborates on the reasons for the fall, which are likely negative. Therefore, the probability of a further fall is higher than a rise in the short term.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The article expresses a pessimistic outlook on Apple's short-term stock performance.  While the upcoming Q1 earnings report is crucial, the author believes that even a positive report is unlikely to significantly boost the stock price due to already high expectations and a relatively high P/E ratio.  The article highlights concerns about stagnant revenue growth, diminishing returns from share buybacks, and increasing competition.  The author's prediction is based on these factors and the current market sentiment, suggesting a higher probability of the stock price remaining flat or falling slightly, rather than experiencing a significant rise. The promotional section at the end is irrelevant to the analysis of the news itself.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies to Underperform, concerns about slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth, slower AI adoption, and competitive pressures in China and the budget segment. The stock has already declined by 3.80% following the news, indicating strong negative sentiment. Given the combination of downgrades, lowered price targets, and fundamental challenges, the probability of further stock price decline is high in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates that Apple's stock price has been declining due to concerns over iPhone sales and analyst downgrades. The company's stock has dropped 11% in January and 14% from its December peak. Analysts have expressed concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in China, and have cited weak demand and high competition as reasons for the downgrades. With 8.5% of analysts having a bearish rating and only 60% recommending the stock, the sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. Additionally, Apple's market capitalization has dropped below that of Nvidia Corp., and the stock has closed at its lowest since November. Given these factors, it is likely that the stock price will continue to decline in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company has experienced stagnant revenue growth over the past few years, and the article suggests that Apple needs to change the narrative around its stock. The article also mentions that Wall Street analysts aren't expecting a lot from Apple in Q1, with projected 3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth. Given the high expectations and the company's history of stagnant growth, the article concludes that investors should not buy Apple stock before Jan. 30. Based on this analysis, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news describes Meta Platforms Inc.'s plans to expand its range of wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, with a focus on embedding artificial intelligence features. This initiative could lead to increased competition with Apple Inc., particularly in the smartwatch and wireless earbuds market. However, it also represents an effort by Meta to establish itself as a major player in the AI-driven hardware space. Although this could be seen as a positive for Meta, it might create uncertainty for Apple investors regarding the long-term competitiveness of their products.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, raises concerns about her confidence in the stock's short-term performance, which could negatively influence investor sentiment. Additionally, the overall market sentiment appears to be bearish towards Apple, with multiple analysts expressing concerns about stagnant revenue growth, competition, and recent downgrades. The previous predictions indicate a strong consensus on the likelihood of a price decline, with many analysts citing specific negative factors affecting Apple's performance. Given these considerations, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The headline indicates Apple's stock fell while the market rallied, suggesting company-specific negative news. Previous rounds of predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock falling, citing factors like analyst downgrades, concerns about iPhone sales, and competition. Nancy Pelosi's sale of shares adds a layer of negative sentiment, although its impact is debatable. Considering the consensus from previous predictions and the initial negative signal from the headline, I'm maintaining a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a largely bearish outlook on Apple's short-term prospects.  While the upcoming Q1 earnings report is crucial, the article highlights several significant headwinds: stagnant revenue growth for several years, diminishing returns from share buybacks, increasing competition, and relatively low expectations from Wall Street analysts (3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth).  The author explicitly advises against buying Apple stock before the earnings report, citing a high P/E ratio and a lack of significant growth potential.  The previous predictions also lean heavily towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. While a strong Q1 report could potentially mitigate some negative sentiment, the overall tone of the article and the prevailing concerns suggest a greater likelihood of a price decline or stagnation than a significant rise.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the possibility of a positive surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies to Underperform, concerns about slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth, slower AI adoption, and competitive pressures in China and the budget segment. The stock has already declined by 3.80% following the news, indicating strong negative sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-80% chance of a decline. Given the combination of downgrades, lowered price targets, and fundamental challenges, the probability of further stock price decline remains high in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news headline and content indicate a negative outlook for Apple's stock price due to analyst downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales. The stock has already declined by 3.2% and 11% in January, and analysts have expressed concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in China. With 8.5% of analysts having a bearish rating and only 60% recommending the stock, the sentiment is overwhelmingly negative. Additionally, Apple's market capitalization has dropped below that of Nvidia Corp., and the stock has closed at its lowest since November. Given these factors, it is likely that the stock price will continue to decline in the short term.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's upcoming earnings report and the potential impact on its stock price. The company has experienced stagnant revenue growth over the past few years, and the article suggests that Apple needs to change the narrative around its stock. The article also mentions that Wall Street analysts aren't expecting a lot from Apple in Q1, with projected 3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth.

Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Meta Platforms Inc.'s plans to expand its range of wearable devices, including smart glasses, watches, and earbuds, with a focus on embedding artificial intelligence features. These initiatives could present increased competition for Apple Inc. in the smartwatch and wireless earbuds market. However, the news doesn't provide immediate evidence of direct negative impact on Apple's short-term performance or financial metrics. The previously provided predictions suggest a generally negative outlook for Apple\u2019s stock, with most estimations indicating a higher probability of the stock price falling. While Meta's expansion plans may cause short-term uncertainty for Apple's competitive position, this alone does not appear to be a strong enough catalyst to significantly sway the current market sentiment.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The recent news about Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of Apple shares raises concerns about investor confidence in the stock. Coupled with ongoing negative sentiment regarding Apple's stagnant revenue growth, analyst downgrades, and competition, the overall outlook appears bearish. Previous predictions consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts citing specific negative factors affecting Apple's performance. Given these considerations, I estimate a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The headline indicates Apple's stock fell while the market rallied, suggesting company-specific negative news.

The consensus from previous predictions and the initial negative signal from the headline, I'm maintaining a higher probability of the stock price falling. The trend of predictions is also showing a slight increase in the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news article presents a bearish outlook on Apple's short-term stock performance.  Key concerns include stagnant revenue growth, diminishing returns from share buybacks, increasing competition, and low Wall Street expectations for Q1 earnings (3.9% sales growth and 7.8% EPS growth). The article explicitly advises against buying Apple stock before the January 30th earnings report, citing a high P/E ratio and lack of significant growth potential.  Previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. While a strong Q1 report could positively surprise the market, the overall tone of the article and the prevailing concerns suggest a greater likelihood of a price decline or stagnation.  The consensus from multiple AI models reinforces this negative sentiment.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the possibility of a positive surprise from the earnings report, but weighting that possibility lower given the existing headwinds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights significant negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Jefferies to Underperform, concerns about slowing iPhone demand, weaker-than-expected revenue growth, slower AI adoption, and competitive pressures in China and the budget segment.

Factors such as analyst downgrades, concerns about iPhone sales (particularly in China), stagnant revenue growth, and increasing competition are consistently cited. The fact that Apple's stock fell even as the market rallied underscores company-specific issues. The trend in previous predictions shows a strengthening belief in a price decline. While a positive surprise in the upcoming earnings report could offer some upside, the prevailing headwinds and negative sentiment make a further price decline more likely.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article presents a largely bearish outlook on Apple's short-term stock performance.
