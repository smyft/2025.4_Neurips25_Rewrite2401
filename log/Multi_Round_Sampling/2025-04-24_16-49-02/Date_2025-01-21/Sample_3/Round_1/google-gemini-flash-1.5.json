(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target increase of 41% by 2025, driven by the integration of AI solutions and a strong services segment. However, there is a note of caution regarding the historical high valuation of the stock and the recent reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, which may indicate some investor hesitance. Overall, the positive analyst sentiment and potential for growth suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Jefferies downgraded Apple, citing concerns about slowing iPhone demand, broader consumer electronics headwinds, and slower AI growth. They also lowered the price target. Data from IDC shows a decline in iPhone shipments. Subsidies in China are expected to exclude iPhones, further dampening demand. The budget iPhone SE4 faces tough competition. The stock is already down significantly. While earnings are upcoming, the negative sentiment and concrete data points suggest further downside risk. The market has already reacted negatively, indicating a strong consensus view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article highlights a significant downgrade of Apple's stock rating by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales expectations, particularly for the iPhone 17, 18, and the upcoming SE 4.  The analysts point to limited hardware upgrades, weak demand in China, and the attractiveness of used iPhones as factors contributing to this weakness.  The current market reaction, with Apple's stock falling almost 4% and Nvidia surpassing it in market capitalization, further supports this negative outlook. While there's always potential for a rebound, the confluence of negative factors presented in the Jefferies report suggests a higher probability of further price decline in the short term.  The lack of positive news or counterarguments in the article reinforces this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the significant income generated by 'Severance' Season 1 and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso,' which has been a blockbuster for the platform. This indicates strong performance in Apple's streaming division, which could positively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple has not disclosed specific financial details for its streaming operation, which may limit the immediate impact on the stock price. Given the positive nature of the news and the potential for increased revenue from streaming, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, but the effect may be moderate due to the lack of concrete financial data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is neutral and inquires about the current status of Apple Inc. as a market leader. The headline does not provide any direct information that would cause a significant positive or negative impact on the stock price. It suggests a questioning or uncertain tone rather than a statement of fact that could drive immediate stock price movement. Therefore, based on this headline alone, the probability of the stock price rising or falling significantly is relatively low. However, the nature of the question might lean slightly towards a negative perception if investors interpret it as a sign of potential weakness or uncertainty about Apple's market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech companies, including Apple, are building relationships with President Donald Trump, which could lead to favorable policies and regulations for the tech industry. Additionally, the article highlights the growing importance of cybersecurity, which could benefit Apple and other tech companies. The article also mentions that cybersecurity stocks have performed well since Trump's election win, with Cloudflare outperforming its peer group. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance or prospects. Based on the general positive sentiment towards the tech industry and cybersecurity, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential upside for Apple stock as predicted by an analyst from Wedbush. The analyst expects a 41% increase in stock price due to AI integration and strong services segment performance. However, recent data shows that Warren Buffett has reduced his holdings in Apple, suggesting caution. Despite the positive outlook, the historical high valuation relative to earnings might act as a deterrent.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Jefferies' downgrade to 'Underperform', citing weak iPhone sales (particularly the 17, 18, and SE4), limited hardware upgrades, and weak Chinese demand, is a significant bearish signal.  The 4% drop in Apple's stock price and Nvidia's market cap surpassing Apple's further reinforces this negative sentiment.  While previous predictions are mixed, the concrete data points presented (IDC data on iPhone shipments, Jefferies' supply chain checks) strongly suggest a higher probability of further price decline in the short term.

The overall picture paints a scenario of weakening demand and potential for further negative market reaction.
