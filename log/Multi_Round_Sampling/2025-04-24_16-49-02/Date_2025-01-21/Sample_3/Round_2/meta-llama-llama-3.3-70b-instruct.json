(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Cloudflare CEO on why Apple's Tim Cook, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, and other tech leaders are bending to Trump\nNews Content: Big Tech is kissing the ring of President Donald Trump after having a contentious relationship with him in his first term.\n\nThat schmoozing was on display at Trump's inauguration as the likes of Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook snatched better seats at the event than incoming cabinet members.\n\n\"I do think that in a lot of these cases, these are companies that had something that they had to fix. They had problems and potential risk that was out there. And I think they were kind of coming and saying, listen, we're willing to talk to you. We're willing to engage and at some level,\" Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe tech veteran didn't attend the inauguration but added there has been \"kind of the war on tech\" that hobbled the industry.\n\n\"The tech industry is very much like one of the US battleships. It is an incredibly powerful force for the United States, around the rest of the world,\" he said. \"I think if we actually start investing in tech, and not just the big companies, but startups, little tech, all of the different organizations that are out there, that's a huge advantage that the US has.\"\n\nCybersecurity stocks have performed relatively well since Donald Trump's election win in early November.\n\nCloudflare has outperformed its peer group, rising about 28% since Election Day. Fortinet (FTNT) is up 18%. ZScaler (ZS) is up 3%, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has shed 3%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NET)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nThe optimism could be traced to several factors.\n\nFor one, investment pros say Trump will be friendly to the cybersecurity business model. Recall that in September 2018, Trump signed off on the National Cyber Strategy. The doctrine aimed to encourage government and private investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. It also sought to bolster domestic innovation in the sector.\n\nSecond, a mega trend such as AI and potentially looser regulations around dealmaking under Trump may spur profits and valuations on the cybersecurity stocks.\n\n\"We believe the cyber security sector will have a robust 2025 and should be one of the strongest sub-sector with our view cyber security could be up 30%+ over the next year led by accelerated cloud and AI growth along with M&A we expect to be very active in this tech area,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nAnd three, a more digital-first world is simply getting riskier by the day, pointed out the World Economic Forum in its 2025 global cybersecurity outlook report. With that comes the need to bolster cybersecurity tools at companies and governments.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"The prevailing turmoil has affected the perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/ intellectual property theft as their top concern, while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about disruption of operations and business processes,\" the report said.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target increase of 41% by 2025, driven by the integration of AI solutions and a strong services segment. However, there is a note of caution regarding the historical high valuation of the stock and the recent reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, which may indicate some investor hesitance. Overall, the positive analyst sentiment and potential for growth suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Jefferies downgraded Apple, citing concerns about slowing iPhone demand, broader consumer electronics headwinds, and slower AI growth. They also lowered the price target. Data from IDC shows a decline in iPhone shipments. Subsidies in China are expected to exclude iPhones, further dampening demand. The budget iPhone SE4 faces tough competition. The stock is already down significantly. While earnings are upcoming, the negative sentiment and concrete data points suggest further downside risk. The market has already reacted negatively, indicating a strong consensus view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article highlights a significant downgrade of Apple's stock rating by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales expectations, particularly for the iPhone 17, 18, and the upcoming SE 4.  The analysts point to limited hardware upgrades, weak demand in China, and the attractiveness of used iPhones as factors contributing to this weakness.  The current market reaction, with Apple's stock falling almost 4% and Nvidia surpassing it in market capitalization, further supports this negative outlook. While there's always potential for a rebound, the confluence of negative factors presented in the Jefferies report suggests a higher probability of further price decline in the short term.  The lack of positive news or counterarguments in the article reinforces this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the significant income generated by 'Severance' Season 1 and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso,' which has been a blockbuster for the platform. This indicates strong performance in Apple's streaming division, which could positively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple has not disclosed specific financial details for its streaming operation, which may limit the immediate impact on the stock price. Given the positive nature of the news and the potential for increased revenue from streaming, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, but the effect may be moderate due to the lack of concrete financial data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is neutral and inquires about the current status of Apple Inc. as a market leader. The headline does not provide any direct information that would cause a significant positive or negative impact on the stock price. It suggests a questioning or uncertain tone rather than a statement of fact that could drive immediate stock price movement. Therefore, based on this headline alone, the probability of the stock price rising or falling significantly is relatively low. However, the nature of the question might lean slightly towards a negative perception if investors interpret it as a sign of potential weakness or uncertainty about Apple's market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech companies, including Apple, are building relationships with President Donald Trump, which could lead to favorable policies and regulations for the tech industry. Additionally, the article highlights the growing importance of cybersecurity, which could benefit Apple and other tech companies. The article also mentions that cybersecurity stocks have performed well since Trump's election win, with Cloudflare outperforming its peer group. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance or prospects. Based on the general positive sentiment towards the tech industry and cybersecurity, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential upside for Apple stock as predicted by an analyst from Wedbush. The analyst expects a 41% increase in stock price due to AI integration and strong services segment performance. However, recent data shows that Warren Buffett has reduced his holdings in Apple, suggesting caution. Despite the positive outlook, the historical high valuation relative to earnings might act as a deterrent.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target increase of 41% by 2025, driven by the integration of AI solutions and a strong services segment. However, there are concerns regarding the historical high valuation of the stock and the recent reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, which may indicate some investor hesitance. The mixed sentiments from previous predictions, with some indicating strong negative outlooks due to slowing iPhone demand and others showing optimism based on AI integration, suggest a cautious but slightly positive sentiment overall. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall, but with significant caution due to the negative factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Jefferies downgraded Apple, citing concerns about slowing iPhone demand, broader consumer electronics headwinds, and slower AI growth. They also lowered the price target. Data from IDC shows a decline in iPhone shipments. Subsidies in China are expected to exclude iPhones, further dampening demand. The budget iPhone SE4 faces tough competition. The stock is already down significantly. The previous round predictions are mixed, but the more recent ones lean towards negative. Given the continued negative pressure and the lack of any positive counterpoints, I expect the stock to continue to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  Jefferies' downgrade to 'Underperform', citing weak iPhone sales (particularly the 17, 18, and SE4), limited hardware upgrades, and weak Chinese demand, is a significant bearish signal.  The 4% drop in Apple's stock price and Nvidia's market cap surpassing Apple's further reinforces this negative sentiment.  While previous predictions are mixed, the concrete data points presented (IDC data on iPhone shipments, Jefferies' supply chain checks) strongly suggest a higher probability of further price decline in the short term. The argument that used iPhones are a more attractive option than the SE4 further supports this negative outlook.  The overall picture paints a scenario of weakening demand and potential for further negative market reaction.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the significant income generated by 'Severance' Season 1 and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso,' which has been a blockbuster for the platform.

Given the positive nature of the news and the potential for increased revenue from streaming, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, but the effect may be moderate due to the lack of concrete financial data. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a rise due to positive news and others cautioning due to lack of specific financials. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the potential for revenue growth, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the relationship between Big Tech companies, including Apple, and President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential for favorable policies and regulations for the tech industry.

The article also mentions that cybersecurity stocks have performed well since Trump's election win. Considering the general positive sentiment towards the tech industry and cybersecurity, and taking into account the predictions from other models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.
