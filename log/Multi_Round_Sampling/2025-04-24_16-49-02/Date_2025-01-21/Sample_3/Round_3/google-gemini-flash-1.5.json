      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Nvidia is the world's most valuable company again as Apple stock slips\nNews Content: Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target increase of 41% by 2025, driven by the integration of AI solutions and a strong services segment. However, there is a note of caution regarding the historical high valuation of the stock and the recent reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, which may indicate some investor hesitance. Overall, the positive analyst sentiment and potential for growth suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Jefferies downgraded Apple, citing concerns about slowing iPhone demand, broader consumer electronics headwinds, and slower AI growth. They also lowered the price target. Data from IDC shows a decline in iPhone shipments. Subsidies in China are expected to exclude iPhones, further dampening demand. The budget iPhone SE4 faces tough competition. The stock is already down significantly. While earnings are upcoming, the negative sentiment and concrete data points suggest further downside risk. The market has already reacted negatively, indicating a strong consensus view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article highlights a significant downgrade of Apple's stock rating by Jefferies, citing weak iPhone sales expectations, particularly for the iPhone 17, 18, and the upcoming SE 4.  The analysts point to limited hardware upgrades, weak demand in China, and the attractiveness of used iPhones as factors contributing to this weakness.  The current market reaction, with Apple's stock falling almost 4% and Nvidia surpassing it in market capitalization, further supports this negative outlook. While there's always potential for a rebound, the confluence of negative factors presented in the Jefferies report suggests a higher probability of further price decline in the short term.  The lack of positive news or counterarguments in the article reinforces this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the significant income generated by 'Severance' Season 1 and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso,' which has been a blockbuster for the platform. This indicates strong performance in Apple's streaming division, which could positively impact investor sentiment. However, Apple has not disclosed specific financial details for its streaming operation, which may limit the immediate impact on the stock price. Given the positive nature of the news and the potential for increased revenue from streaming, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, but the effect may be moderate due to the lack of concrete financial data.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is neutral and inquires about the current status of Apple Inc. as a market leader. The headline does not provide any direct information that would cause a significant positive or negative impact on the stock price. It suggests a questioning or uncertain tone rather than a statement of fact that could drive immediate stock price movement. Therefore, based on this headline alone, the probability of the stock price rising or falling significantly is relatively low. However, the nature of the question might lean slightly towards a negative perception if investors interpret it as a sign of potential weakness or uncertainty about Apple's market position.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article suggests that Big Tech companies, including Apple, are building relationships with President Donald Trump, which could lead to favorable policies and regulations for the tech industry. Additionally, the article highlights the growing importance of cybersecurity, which could benefit Apple and other tech companies. The article also mentions that cybersecurity stocks have performed well since Trump's election win, with Cloudflare outperforming its peer group. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's financial performance or prospects. Based on the general positive sentiment towards the tech industry and cybersecurity, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights a potential upside for Apple stock as predicted by an analyst from Wedbush. The analyst expects a 41% increase in stock price due to AI integration and strong services segment performance. However, recent data shows that Warren Buffett has reduced his holdings in Apple, suggesting caution. Despite the positive outlook, the historical high valuation relative to earnings might act as a deterrent.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with a projected price target increase of 41% by 2025, driven by the integration of AI solutions and a strong services segment. However, there are concerns regarding the historical high valuation of the stock and the recent reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, which may indicate some investor hesitance. The mixed sentiments from previous predictions, with some indicating strong negative outlooks due to slowing iPhone demand and others showing optimism based on AI integration, suggest a cautious but slightly positive sentiment overall. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall, but with significant caution due to the negative factors.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative. Jefferies downgraded Apple, citing concerns about slowing iPhone demand, broader consumer electronics headwinds, and slower AI growth. They also lowered the price target. Data from IDC shows a decline in iPhone shipments. Subsidies in China are expected to exclude iPhones, further dampening demand. The budget iPhone SE4 faces tough competition. The stock is already down significantly. The previous round predictions are mixed, but the more recent ones lean towards negative. Given the continued negative pressure and the lack of any positive counterpoints, I expect the stock to continue to fall.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  Jefferies' downgrade to 'Underperform', citing weak iPhone sales (particularly the 17, 18, and SE4), limited hardware upgrades, and weak Chinese demand, is a significant bearish signal.  The 4% drop in Apple's stock price and Nvidia's market cap surpassing Apple's further reinforces this negative sentiment.  While previous predictions are mixed, the concrete data points presented (IDC data on iPhone shipments, Jefferies' supply chain checks) strongly suggest a higher probability of further price decline in the short term. The argument that used iPhones are a more attractive option than the SE4 further supports this negative outlook.  The overall picture paints a scenario of weakening demand and potential for further negative market reaction.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the significant income generated by 'Severance' Season 1 and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso,' which has been a blockbuster for the platform.

Given the positive nature of the news and the potential for increased revenue from streaming, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, but the effect may be moderate due to the lack of concrete financial data. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a rise due to positive news and others cautioning due to lack of specific financials. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the potential for revenue growth, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the relationship between Big Tech companies, including Apple, and President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential for favorable policies and regulations for the tech industry. Additionally, the article highlights the growing importance of cybersecurity, which could benefit Apple and other tech companies. The article also mentions that cybersecurity stocks have performed well since Trump's election win. Considering the general positive sentiment towards the tech industry and cybersecurity, and taking into account the predictions from other models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, the lack of specific information about Apple's financial performance or prospects in the article and the mixed predictions from other models lead me to a moderate probability estimate.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While there is a positive analyst projection of a 41% price increase by 2025 due to AI integration and a strong services segment, there are significant concerns regarding slowing iPhone demand and a recent reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple. Previous predictions show a wide range of sentiments, with some models indicating strong negative outlooks due to recent downgrades and market reactions, while others highlight potential growth from Apple's services and AI initiatives. Given the conflicting signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with considerable caution due to the negative factors at play.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.15, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.85, Reasoning: The current news is significantly negative, with Jefferies downgrading Apple due to concerns about iPhone demand, AI growth, and broader consumer electronics headwinds. The lowered price target and IDC data showing a decline in iPhone shipments further reinforce this negative outlook. The stock is already down significantly. While some previous predictions were more optimistic based on potential AI integration and services growth, the current concrete data points and analyst downgrade outweigh those factors. The trend in previous predictions is also shifting towards a more negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple.  Jefferies' downgrade to 'Underperform', citing weak iPhone sales across multiple models (17, 18, and SE4), limited hardware upgrades, and particularly weak Chinese demand, is a significant bearish signal. The 4% drop in Apple's stock price on the day of the news and Nvidia's market cap surpassing Apple's further reinforces this negative sentiment.  While some previous predictions were more optimistic, focusing on potential AI integration or Apple TV+ success, the concrete data points presented (IDC data on iPhone shipments, Jefferies' supply chain checks) strongly suggest a higher probability of further price decline in the short term. The argument that used iPhones are a more attractive option than the new SE4 further supports this negative outlook. The overall picture paints a scenario of weakening demand and potential for further negative market reaction.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise.  The previous round's predictions show a trend towards a more negative outlook, further supporting this assessment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights the success of Apple TV+ with the significant income generated by 'Severance' Season 1 and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso,' which has been a blockbuster for the platform.

Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a rise due to positive news and others cautioning due to lack of specific financials. Considering the overall positive tone of the news and the potential for revenue growth, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news headline 'Is Apple Stock Still a Market Leader?' is neutral and inquires about the current status of Apple Inc. as a market leader. The previous predictions from various models show a mixed sentiment, with some indicating a positive outlook due to AI integration and strong services segment performance, while others express caution or a negative outlook due to slowing iPhone demand, weak Chinese demand, and downgrades from analysts like Jefferies. Considering the neutral nature of the headline and the mixed predictions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with significant caution due to the negative factors.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news article discusses the relationship between Big Tech companies, including Apple, and President Donald Trump, suggesting a potential for favorable policies and regulations for the tech industry.

(AAPL) by 2025, driven by the integration of AI solutions and strong performance in the services segment. However, there is a mixed sentiment with concerns about the historical high valuation and recent reductions in Berkshire Hathaway's stake. Previous predictions from various models show a range of sentiments, with some predicting a rise due to positive outlooks and others predicting a fall due to concerns about demand and valuation. Considering the mixed signals and the historical high valuation, the probability of a rise is moderately positive, but caution is advised.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
