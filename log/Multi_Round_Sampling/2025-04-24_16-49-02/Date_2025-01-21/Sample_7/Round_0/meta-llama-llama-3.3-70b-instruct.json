This could be perceived as a bearish signal for Apple, as it may indicate a loss of confidence in the company's prospects. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the overall market sentiment or the company's fundamental performance. Additionally, the sale of Apple shares might be a portfolio rebalancing move rather than a direct commentary on the company's prospects. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nancy Pelosi Buys Alphabet, Amazon Calls While Selling Apple, Nvidia Shares\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
