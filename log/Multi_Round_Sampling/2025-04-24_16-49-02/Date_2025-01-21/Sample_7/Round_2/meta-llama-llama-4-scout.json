(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of Apple shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, may signal a lack of confidence in the stock's short-term performance, which could lead to negative sentiment among investors. However, the overall market reaction to her trading activities can be mixed, as her previous trades have shown significant gains. The news may create uncertainty, leading to a higher probability of a price decline. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a higher chance of the stock price falling due to the negative implications of her selling activity.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: This news highlights a prominent figure, Nancy Pelosi, selling a significant amount of Apple shares. While Pelosi's trades are often followed, it's crucial to consider the context. The sale could be for various reasons unrelated to Apple's performance, such as portfolio rebalancing, tax strategies, or personal financial needs. However, the market may react negatively to the news of a large sale, even if the underlying reasons are benign. The fact that she is simultaneously increasing her position in other tech companies like Alphabet and Amazon could be interpreted as a shift in investment strategy away from Apple. The GuruFocus warning signs for Amazon add a layer of complexity, but the primary focus here is on the potential negative sentiment surrounding the Apple sale. Given the size of the sale ($5M-$25M), it's likely to have a short-term negative impact, but the long-term effect is uncertain and depends on Apple's overall performance and market conditions.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news indicates a bearish sentiment on Wall Street regarding Apple due to slowing growth in the crucial Chinese market.  Downgrades from reputable firms like Loop Capital and Jefferies further support this negative outlook. While Apple's AI initiatives are mentioned as a potential future positive, the analyst's comments suggest this is a long-term prospect and not an immediate catalyst for stock price appreciation. The overall tone is cautious, with the analyst describing the China situation as 'wait-and-see'.  The lack of immediate positive catalysts, coupled with the negative sentiment from analysts and slowing growth in a major market, suggests a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term. However, it's important to note that Apple remains a large and established company, and the probability of a significant fall is not absolute.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article highlights a positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) based on analyst predictions, particularly focusing on the integration of AI into its products and the growth of its Services segment. Analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush has set a price target of $325, implying a 41% upside in 2025. The article also mentions Apple's strong capital-return program and brand loyalty, which are positive indicators. However, it notes that Apple's stock is historically pricey, and Warren Buffett has reduced Berkshire Hathaway's stake by 67%, which could be seen as a cautionary signal. Overall, the positive factors (AI integration, Services growth, capital returns) seem to outweigh the negatives (high valuation, Buffett's reduced stake), suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: Meta Platforms Inc.'s plans to develop and release new wearable devices, including smart glasses and earbuds with AI capabilities, may pose a competitive threat to Apple's existing and future products. However, Apple's established presence in the wearables market, particularly with its successful AirPods and Apple Watch, could mitigate the impact. The news about Meta's upcoming products does not directly imply a significant short-term impact on Apple's stock price, but it does indicate a competitive landscape that tech giants are actively exploring new wearable and AR technologies. Given Meta's ambitions in wearables and its focus on integrating AI features into various products, Apple's strategic position in the market and its own investments in AR and wearables could help it navigate the competition. The development and release of Meta's new products might influence investor sentiment regarding Apple's competitive position in wearables and AR technologies, but the direct threat to Apple's core business seems limited for now.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article reports that Nancy Pelosi, a high-profile investor, has sold a significant number of Apple shares (31,600) and purchased call options on Alphabet and Amazon. This could be perceived as a bearish signal for Apple, as it may indicate a loss of confidence in the company's prospects. However, it's essential to consider that Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the overall market sentiment or the company's fundamental performance. Additionally, the sale of Apple shares might be a portfolio rebalancing move rather than a direct commentary on the company's prospects. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The financial news indicates that Apple Inc.'s Q4 China sales reportedly dropped, which could negatively impact the stock price as China is a significant market for Apple. However, the broader market context shows that major market averages were higher around midday, suggesting a positive sentiment. The negative news about China sales outweighs the general market trend for Apple.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Nancy Pelosi's sale of a significant number of Apple shares, valued between $5 million and $25 million, raises concerns about investor confidence in the stock. The simultaneous increase in her positions in Alphabet and Amazon could be interpreted as a shift in investment strategy away from Apple, which may further contribute to negative sentiment. While some analysts have pointed to positive long-term factors for Apple, such as AI integration and strong brand loyalty, the immediate impact of Pelosi's trades and the broader market sentiment suggest a higher likelihood of a price decline in the short term. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a greater chance of the stock price falling due to the negative implications of her selling activity.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news of Nancy Pelosi selling a significant amount of Apple shares ($5M-$25M) is generally considered a negative signal, as it might indicate a lack of confidence in the company's short-term performance. While her motivations could be varied (portfolio rebalancing, tax strategies), the market often reacts negatively to such large sales by prominent figures. The fact that she's simultaneously increasing her position in Alphabet and Amazon could be interpreted as a shift in investment strategy away from Apple. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a consensus that this news leans towards a negative impact on the stock price. The previous round's predictions show a tendency towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with some models highlighting the potential negative sentiment surrounding the Apple sale. Therefore, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect this sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  Downgrades from Wall Street firms due to slowing growth in China are a significant negative factor.  This is corroborated by the analyst's 'wait-and-see' assessment of the Chinese market, suggesting a lack of near-term catalysts for growth in that region.  While Apple's AI initiatives are mentioned as a potential future positive, the analyst emphasizes their early stage and lack of immediate impact.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall, particularly influenced by the Pelosi share sale in earlier rounds. However, the current news focuses on China's slowing growth, which is a more direct and impactful factor than Pelosi's actions. Considering the weight of the negative news regarding China, and the lack of immediate positive counter-arguments, the probability of a price fall is higher.  The overall sentiment is bearish, but Apple's established position and potential future growth in AI mitigate the risk of a drastic fall.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights analyst Dan Ives' bullish price target of $325, implying a 41% upside in 2025, driven by Apple's AI integration and strong Services segment growth. However, the article also notes that Apple's stock is historically pricey, and Warren Buffett has significantly reduced Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which could signal caution. Previous predictions from other models show a split in sentiment, with some leaning bearish due to factors like Nancy Pelosi's sale and slowing growth in China, while others are more optimistic about Apple's long-term prospects. Given the balance of positive (AI, Services growth) and negative (high valuation, Buffett's reduced stake) factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news about Meta Platforms Inc. planning to release new wearable devices, including Oakley-branded smart glasses, watches, and camera-equipped earbuds, may pose a competitive threat to Apple's existing and future products in the wearables market. However, Apple's established presence with successful products like AirPods and Apple Watch could mitigate the impact. The focus on AI integration and new wearable technologies by Meta indicates a competitive landscape, but it does not directly imply a significant short-term impact on Apple's stock price. Apple's strategic position in the market and its own investments in AR and wearables could help it navigate the competition. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, reflecting a cautious but not overly negative outlook.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news of Nancy Pelosi selling Apple shares and buying call options on Alphabet and Amazon may create a negative sentiment among investors, potentially leading to a decrease in Apple's stock price. However, considering the overall market conditions, the company's fundamental performance, and the fact that Pelosi's investment decisions may not necessarily reflect the overall market sentiment, the impact may be mitigated. The previous predictions from other models show a mixed trend, with some predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling and others predicting a higher probability of it rising. Taking into account the information provided and the potential implications of Pelosi's trades, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be slightly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a drop in Apple's Q4 China sales, which is a significant concern given China's importance as a market for the company. Previous predictions from various models indicate a consistent bearish sentiment, primarily due to concerns over China's market performance, sell-offs by influential investors, and competitive pressures from Meta. The overall market sentiment seems less impactful on Apple specifically. Considering the provided models' predictions and the core concern of China sales, the probability of the stock price falling is higher.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
