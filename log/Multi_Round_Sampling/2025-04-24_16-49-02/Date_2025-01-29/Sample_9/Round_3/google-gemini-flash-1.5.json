(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nNews Content: It's a good time to be a bull on Wall Street. Since the start of 2023, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-inspired Nasdaq Composite have respectively soared by 34%, 59%, and 91%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 24, 2025.\n\nInvestors haven't hurt for catalysts, with a softening in the prevailing rate of inflation, better-than-expected corporate earnings, and Donald Trump's return to the White House helping to lift equities. But topping the list of factors that have sparked this bull market rally is the ascension of artificial intelligence (AI).Image source: Apple.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's most-influential businesses have leaned on AI as a way to fuel their growth, one of Wall Street's biggest businesses, tech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has put $725 billion to work elsewhere to boost its bottom line.\n\nApple is one of Wall Street's largest businesses for a reason (and AI is part of it)\n\nApple was the very first public company to top $3 trillion in market value, and as of this past weekend was the second-largest company, behind only Nvidia. Apple has consistently led Wall Street higher for years -- and its success is no accident.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone is the premier smartphone domestically. Since rolling out the first 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple's share of domestic smartphone sales has been 50% or higher. The ongoing upgrade of wireless networks to support 5G download speeds has led to relatively consistent demand for the company's iPhone.\n\nApple's innovation has also played a key role in sending its market cap to north of $3 trillion. This innovation includes physical products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as its ongoing transformation into a platforms company.\n\nFor years, CEO Tim Cook has overseen the push to promote subscription services. By focusing on subscriptions, Apple has an opportunity to lift its operating margin, improve its already impressive customer loyalty, and smooth out the revenue peaks and valleys that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles. Apple's Services segment has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage and now accounts for around a quarter of the company's net sales.\n\nLike most tech stocks, Apple is betting big on AI to power its top-and-bottom-line growth. Last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, which is its AI-driven personal intelligence model for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Intelligence can do everything from write and summarize text to create images for users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLastly, Apple's balance sheet is cash rich, which allows it to aggressively invest in its future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis $725 billion investment has been crucial to Apple's profit growth\n\nWhile this confluence of factors has helped Apple become the company it is today, arguably the greatest driver of Apple's growth in earnings per share (EPS) hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm talking about Apple's single greatest investment: stock repurchases.\n\nIn 2013, Apple's board kicked off a share buyback program that quickly became the envy of the investing word. Here's a breakdown of Apple's repurchasing activity in each of its last 11 fiscal years (its fiscal year typically ends in late September):\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion 2024: $94.949 billion\n\nCollectively, Apple has bought back $725.69 billion of its shares spanning 11 years and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% in the process. To put this into some context, the $6.08 in EPS Apple reported in fiscal 2024 would have equated to just $3.47 in EPS if the board hadn't authorized any share buybacks.AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts.\n\nAn ongoing share repurchase program serves a number of purposes for Apple. For one, as noted, it reduces the company's outstanding share count, which can increase EPS and make the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nSecondly, buyback programs tend to incentivize long-term investing. When a company's outstanding share count declines by a considerable amount over time, it incrementally increases the ownership stakes of investors. When investors buy and hold, it typically reduces share price volatility, which can also make a stock more attractive to investors.\n\nAnd third, buybacks intimate that Apple's insiders (the board and management team) believe shares of their company remain attractively valued.\n\nNot even Apple's world-leading buyback program can mask these issues\n\nWith more cash than Apple knows what to do with on its balance sheet (and generated from its operations), there's no end in sight to this world-leading buyback program.\n\nBut just because Apple is buying back its shares at a breakneck pace, it doesn't necessarily mean its stock is a good value. Billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in its top holding, Apple, over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30) -- and there are two good reasons why this selling is likely taking place.AAPL Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nFirst off, Apple's physical product sales have stalled out for two years. Even though iPhone remains the top-selling smartphone in the U.S., stagnant sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other wearables suggest consumers aren't being wowed by the company's physical products in the same way they have in the past. Though it's possible the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac will turn these fortunes around, not even historically high inflation helped Apple grow sales of its physical product lines in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe other prominent concern with Apple is that its stock is historically pricey. Despite its aggressive share buybacks, Apple recently hit a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 42, which is a level that hasn't been witnessed in 17 years. The stock market is itself pushing the envelope on the valuation front, and Apple's premium is even more pronounced.\n\nThough Apple's share repurchases are bound to continue, there's a lot of work to be done with the company's physical products before its current valuation makes sense.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns suggests potential geopolitical tensions that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of competitive AI technologies may stimulate innovation, the associated national security risks could lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of US tech firms. This uncertainty may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to advertising updates. While Evercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL) and sees AI benefits driving future growth, the article doesn't provide specific catalysts for immediate price movement. The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock buyback program as a key driver of its EPS growth. While this is positive, the article also points out concerns: stagnant sales of physical products for two years, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Apple stake.  These factors suggest a potential overvaluation and risk of a price correction. Although Apple is investing in AI, the article emphasizes that the buybacks, not AI, have been the primary growth engine. The overall picture is mixed. The buybacks are a strong positive, but the high valuation and stagnant sales are significant negatives.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely in the short term given the market's overall bullish sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales projections and increasing competition in China. The firm also reduced its price target and lowered earnings and revenue forecasts for FY26. Additionally, Apple's market share in China has significantly declined, with iPhone shipments dropping by 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024. These factors suggest a bearish outlook for Apple's stock in the short to medium term. While the EBITDA margin improved year on year, the overall sentiment from the news is negative, likely leading to a decline in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to drive near-term device upgrades. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses caution about the upcoming earnings season and warns of a potential disappointment. However, he also advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. Given Cramer's mixed views, the probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on how the market reacts to the earnings report and the overall economic conditions. Considering Cramer's reputation and the general market uncertainty, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher due to the anticipated disappointment, but the long-term prospects of the company remain positive.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding China's DeepSeek AI raises significant national security concerns that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. The competitive pressure from lower-cost Chinese AI technologies may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation, which could weigh on investor sentiment. While some analysts see potential benefits from AI advancements, the geopolitical implications and the current market sentiment lean towards a bearish outlook for Apple. Given the previous predictions, which generally indicate a higher probability of stock price decline due to negative factors such as reduced iPhone sales forecasts and increased competition, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to advertising updates. While Evercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL) and sees AI benefits driving future growth, the article doesn't provide specific catalysts for immediate price movement. The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock. Considering the previous predictions, there is no strong consensus on the direction of Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral outcome. I will adjust my prediction based on the previous rounds, giving slightly more weight to the possibility of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the massive stock buyback program is undeniably positive and has significantly boosted EPS, several significant concerns are raised.  Stagnant physical product sales for two years, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's significant stake reduction point to potential overvaluation and a risk of correction.  Although Apple is investing in AI, the article emphasizes that buybacks, not AI, have been the primary growth driver.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning heavily towards a price fall due to the negative factors mentioned in the article.  Considering the overall market bullishness mentioned in the article, a complete collapse is unlikely. However, the combination of overvaluation and stagnant sales makes a price rise less probable than a fall in the short term.  I'm weighting the negative factors more heavily due to the potential for a market correction, especially given the high P/E ratio.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors for Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales projections, increasing competition in China, and reduced earnings and revenue forecasts for FY26. The decline in iPhone shipments in China (25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024) further underscores the challenges. While the EBITDA margin improved year on year, the overall sentiment from the news is bearish, suggesting downward pressure on the stock price. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-80% chance of a decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.

Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure. The previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.8 for a fall. Considering the overall negative sentiment and the specific concerns raised by Oppenheimer, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a trend of bearish outlook for Apple's stock, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple, including a downgrade by Oppenheimer, reduced iPhone sales forecasts, and increased competition in the Chinese market. Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Moreover, the news directly impacts key metrics such as sales and earnings estimates, which are crucial indicators for investors. The market appears to be responding negatively to these factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding China's DeepSeek AI raises significant national security concerns that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple.
