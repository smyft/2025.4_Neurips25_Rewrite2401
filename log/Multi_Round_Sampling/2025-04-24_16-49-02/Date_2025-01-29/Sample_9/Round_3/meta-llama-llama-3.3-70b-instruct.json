(AAPL): \u2018We Have The Most Widely Anticipated Disappointment That I\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns suggests potential geopolitical tensions that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of competitive AI technologies may stimulate innovation, the associated national security risks could lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of US tech firms. This uncertainty may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to advertising updates. While Evercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL) and sees AI benefits driving future growth, the article doesn't provide specific catalysts for immediate price movement. The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock buyback program as a key driver of its EPS growth. While this is positive, the article also points out concerns: stagnant sales of physical products for two years, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Apple stake.  These factors suggest a potential overvaluation and risk of a price correction. Although Apple is investing in AI, the article emphasizes that the buybacks, not AI, have been the primary growth engine. The overall picture is mixed. The buybacks are a strong positive, but the high valuation and stagnant sales are significant negatives.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely in the short term given the market's overall bullish sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales projections and increasing competition in China. The firm also reduced its price target and lowered earnings and revenue forecasts for FY26. Additionally, Apple's market share in China has significantly declined, with iPhone shipments dropping by 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024. These factors suggest a bearish outlook for Apple's stock in the short to medium term. While the EBITDA margin improved year on year, the overall sentiment from the news is negative, likely leading to a decline in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to drive near-term device upgrades. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses caution about the upcoming earnings season and warns of a potential disappointment. However, he also advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. Given Cramer's mixed views, the probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on how the market reacts to the earnings report and the overall economic conditions. Considering Cramer's reputation and the general market uncertainty, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher due to the anticipated disappointment, but the long-term prospects of the company remain positive.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding China's DeepSeek AI raises significant national security concerns that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. The competitive pressure from lower-cost Chinese AI technologies may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation, which could weigh on investor sentiment. While some analysts see potential benefits from AI advancements, the geopolitical implications and the current market sentiment lean towards a bearish outlook for Apple. Given the previous predictions, which generally indicate a higher probability of stock price decline due to negative factors such as reduced iPhone sales forecasts and increased competition, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to advertising updates. While Evercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL) and sees AI benefits driving future growth, the article doesn't provide specific catalysts for immediate price movement. The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock. Considering the previous predictions, there is no strong consensus on the direction of Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral outcome. I will adjust my prediction based on the previous rounds, giving slightly more weight to the possibility of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the massive stock buyback program is undeniably positive and has significantly boosted EPS, several significant concerns are raised.  Stagnant physical product sales for two years, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's significant stake reduction point to potential overvaluation and a risk of correction.  Although Apple is investing in AI, the article emphasizes that buybacks, not AI, have been the primary growth driver.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning heavily towards a price fall due to the negative factors mentioned in the article.  Considering the overall market bullishness mentioned in the article, a complete collapse is unlikely. However, the combination of overvaluation and stagnant sales makes a price rise less probable than a fall in the short term.  I'm weighting the negative factors more heavily due to the potential for a market correction, especially given the high P/E ratio.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors for Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales projections, increasing competition in China, and reduced earnings and revenue forecasts for FY26. The decline in iPhone shipments in China (25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024) further underscores the challenges. While the EBITDA margin improved year on year, the overall sentiment from the news is bearish, suggesting downward pressure on the stock price. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-80% chance of a decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to drive near-term device upgrades. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure. The previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.8 for a fall. Considering the overall negative sentiment and the specific concerns raised by Oppenheimer, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

However, he also advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. Considering Cramer's mixed views and the general market uncertainty, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher due to the anticipated disappointment. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a trend of bearish outlook for Apple's stock, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple, including a downgrade by Oppenheimer, reduced iPhone sales forecasts, and increased competition in the Chinese market. Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Moreover, the news directly impacts key metrics such as sales and earnings estimates, which are crucial indicators for investors. The market appears to be responding negatively to these factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding China's DeepSeek AI raises significant national security concerns that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple.

The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a price fall due to negative factors affecting Apple in other news articles. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple in this specific article, the probabilities are relatively balanced, but I will slightly lean towards a neutral outcome. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The massive $725 billion stock buyback program is a significant positive, boosting EPS and signaling confidence from insiders. However, this is countered by concerning factors: stagnant physical product sales for two years, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's substantial stake reduction. These suggest potential overvaluation and a risk of correction. While Apple is investing in AI, the article emphasizes that buybacks, not AI, have been the primary growth driver.  The previous predictions show a consistent bearish trend, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price fall.  The combination of overvaluation, stagnant sales, and the bearish sentiment from previous predictions leads me to weight the negative factors more heavily.  While a complete collapse is unlikely given the overall market bullishness and Apple's strong brand, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors for Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales projections, increasing competition in China, and reduced earnings and revenue forecasts for FY26.

The decline in iPhone shipments in China (25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024) further underscores the challenges. While some models previously predicted a relatively balanced outcome, the overall sentiment from the news and previous predictions is bearish, suggesting downward pressure on the stock price. The downgrade by Oppenheimer and the reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and earnings per share are significant concerns. Therefore, considering these factors and the trend from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.
