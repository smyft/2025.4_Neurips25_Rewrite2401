(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why RDDT Is Rising for a Second Straight Day\nNews Content: Reddit (RDDT) is climbing 2% this morning after rallying nearly 8% yesterday. In a note to investors yesterday afternoon, investment bank Piper Sandler contended that a technical update by the social media firm may enable it to attract more advertisers.\n\nReddit's Update Could Be Significant\n\nThe company has made it easier for marketers to replicate on Reddit the ad campaigns that they're using on Meta (META), Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion explained. As a result, the number of firms advertising on Reddit could meaningfully increase, Champion asserted. Such a development, in turn, could cause the firm's revenue growth to accelerate, the analyst wrote.Evercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\n\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\n\nAnother Investment Bank Was Recently Bearish on RDDT\n\nIn a note to investors on Jan. 22, investment bank Roth Capital downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy. The investment bank predicted that the company's revenue growth would decelerate in upcoming quarters, and it expects RDDT's EBITA margins to drop over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Roth predicts that the company's user growth will slow this year after it added a record number of users in 2024. It placed a $195 price target on RDDT.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of RDDT\n\nIn the last month, the shares have advanced 20%, while they are up 70% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns suggests potential geopolitical tensions that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of competitive AI technologies may stimulate innovation, the associated national security risks could lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of US tech firms. This uncertainty may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to advertising updates. While Evercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL) and sees AI benefits driving future growth, the article doesn't provide specific catalysts for immediate price movement. The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral outcome.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's massive $725 billion stock buyback program as a key driver of its EPS growth. While this is positive, the article also points out concerns: stagnant sales of physical products for two years, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Apple stake.  These factors suggest a potential overvaluation and risk of a price correction. Although Apple is investing in AI, the article emphasizes that the buybacks, not AI, have been the primary growth engine. The overall picture is mixed. The buybacks are a strong positive, but the high valuation and stagnant sales are significant negatives.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely in the short term given the market's overall bullish sentiment.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news highlights several negative factors affecting Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales projections and increasing competition in China. The firm also reduced its price target and lowered earnings and revenue forecasts for FY26. Additionally, Apple's market share in China has significantly declined, with iPhone shipments dropping by 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024. These factors suggest a bearish outlook for Apple's stock in the short to medium term. While the EBITDA margin improved year on year, the overall sentiment from the news is negative, likely leading to a decline in stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform due to slower iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China. The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to drive near-term device upgrades. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he expresses caution about the upcoming earnings season and warns of a potential disappointment. However, he also advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. Given Cramer's mixed views, the probability of the stock price rising or falling depends on how the market reacts to the earnings report and the overall economic conditions. Considering Cramer's reputation and the general market uncertainty, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher due to the anticipated disappointment, but the long-term prospects of the company remain positive.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news regarding China's DeepSeek AI raises significant national security concerns that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. The competitive pressure from lower-cost Chinese AI technologies may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation, which could weigh on investor sentiment. While some analysts see potential benefits from AI advancements, the geopolitical implications and the current market sentiment lean towards a bearish outlook for Apple. Given the previous predictions, which generally indicate a higher probability of stock price decline due to negative factors such as reduced iPhone sales forecasts and increased competition, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The news focuses primarily on Reddit (RDDT) and its potential for growth due to advertising updates. While Evercore ISI maintains an \"Outperform\" rating on Apple (AAPL) and sees AI benefits driving future growth, the article doesn't provide specific catalysts for immediate price movement. The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock. Considering the previous predictions, there is no strong consensus on the direction of Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple, the probabilities are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a neutral outcome. I will adjust my prediction based on the previous rounds, giving slightly more weight to the possibility of a price rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the massive stock buyback program is undeniably positive and has significantly boosted EPS, several significant concerns are raised.  Stagnant physical product sales for two years, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's significant stake reduction point to potential overvaluation and a risk of correction.  Although Apple is investing in AI, the article emphasizes that buybacks, not AI, have been the primary growth driver.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning heavily towards a price fall due to the negative factors mentioned in the article.  Considering the overall market bullishness mentioned in the article, a complete collapse is unlikely. However, the combination of overvaluation and stagnant sales makes a price rise less probable than a fall in the short term.  I'm weighting the negative factors more heavily due to the potential for a market correction, especially given the high P/E ratio.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors for Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales projections, increasing competition in China, and reduced earnings and revenue forecasts for FY26. The decline in iPhone shipments in China (25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024) further underscores the challenges. While the EBITDA margin improved year on year, the overall sentiment from the news is bearish, suggesting downward pressure on the stock price. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models estimating a 60-80% chance of a decline. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc.

The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps to drive near-term device upgrades. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will face downward pressure. The previous predictions from various models also suggest a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.45 to 0.8 for a fall. Considering the overall negative sentiment and the specific concerns raised by Oppenheimer, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.

However, he also advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. Considering Cramer's mixed views and the general market uncertainty, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly higher due to the anticipated disappointment. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a trend of bearish outlook for Apple's stock, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Taking these factors into account, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple negative factors impacting Apple, including a downgrade by Oppenheimer, reduced iPhone sales forecasts, and increased competition in the Chinese market. Previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Moreover, the news directly impacts key metrics such as sales and earnings estimates, which are crucial indicators for investors. The market appears to be responding negatively to these factors.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news regarding China's DeepSeek AI raises significant national security concerns that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple.

The mention of AI benefits is vague and doesn't offer concrete reasons for a short-term rise. The previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning towards a price fall due to negative factors affecting Apple in other news articles. Given the lack of direct, strong positive or negative news for Apple in this specific article, the probabilities are relatively balanced, but I will slightly lean towards a neutral outcome. The news is more relevant to RDDT's stock.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The massive $725 billion stock buyback program is a significant positive, boosting EPS and signaling confidence from insiders. However, this is countered by concerning factors: stagnant physical product sales for two years, a historically high P/E ratio of over 42, and Warren Buffett's substantial stake reduction. These suggest potential overvaluation and a risk of correction. While Apple is investing in AI, the article emphasizes that buybacks, not AI, have been the primary growth driver.  The previous predictions show a consistent bearish trend, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price fall.  The combination of overvaluation, stagnant sales, and the bearish sentiment from previous predictions leads me to weight the negative factors more heavily.  While a complete collapse is unlikely given the overall market bullishness and Apple's strong brand, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news highlights significant negative factors for Apple Inc., including a downgrade by Oppenheimer due to weaker iPhone sales projections, increasing competition in China, and reduced earnings and revenue forecasts for FY26.

The decline in iPhone shipments in China (25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year 2024) further underscores the challenges. While some models previously predicted a relatively balanced outcome, the overall sentiment from the news and previous predictions is bearish, suggesting downward pressure on the stock price. The downgrade by Oppenheimer and the reduced forecasts for iPhone sales and earnings per share are significant concerns. Therefore, considering these factors and the trend from previous predictions, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.38, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.62, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc.
