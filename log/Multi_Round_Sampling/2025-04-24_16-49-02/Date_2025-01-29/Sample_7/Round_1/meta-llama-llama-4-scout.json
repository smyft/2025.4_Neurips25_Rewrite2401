A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform suggests a negative outlook for Apple, particularly due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically lead to a bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of an earnings report where expectations may already be high. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the 'Magnificent Seven' are seen as safe assets, which could be a positive for Apple's stock, the article also suggests that this perception leads to lower expected returns and companies spending money on each other, potentially resulting in 'pretty low returns'. The mention of DeepSeek's AI and its potential impact on the tech sector introduces uncertainty. Overall, the news leans slightly negative due to the concerns about low returns and the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor, but the 'safe asset' perception provides some support. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'.  He lists several potential factors contributing to this negative outlook: weak Chinese phone orders, lack of AI boost, slowing service revenue, poor Vision Pro sales, and a significant downward revision to the forecast.  However, he also advises against trading the stock and recommends holding, citing Apple's strong management and historical performance.  His overall message is mixed: a highly negative expectation for the earnings report, but a long-term positive outlook on the company itself.  The market's reaction will depend on how the actual earnings compare to these already very low expectations. A beat could lead to a significant rise, while a miss (even a small one) could trigger a substantial fall. Given the already extremely negative sentiment baked into the prediction, the probability of a price fall is higher, but the magnitude of the movement is uncertain. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights concerns about their dominance in the market. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and low cost of capital. The mention of a tech sell-off triggered by news from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple is part of this group, the overall tone of the article is cautious, implying potential headwinds for Big Tech stocks. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams may mitigate some of the downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling artificial intelligence (AI) features. This downgrade is likely to have a negative impact on the stock price as it reduces investor confidence. Typically, downgrades by reputable analysts can lead to a decrease in stock price as investors adjust their expectations. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While O'Leary's investment strategy focuses on quality companies with strong financial performance, diverse portfolios, and dividend-paying stocks, the article does not explicitly state that AAPL is one of his top picks. However, AAPL is mentioned as a well-established company with a strong balance sheet and a history of consistent dividend growth. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL from $240 to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing a favorable environment for IT spending in 2025. Additionally, AAPL reported a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Considering these positive factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the AI development landscape due to DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. Snowflake CEO suggests that this could challenge assumptions about the high costs associated with AI training. The news indicates that Nvidia's stock has been significantly affected, dropping 16.97%, reflecting investor concerns. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak remains optimistic about Apple, noting that Apple's AI strategy is less capital-intensive compared to other major players. This could position Apple more favorably in investors' eyes, potentially leading to a rise in AAPL's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
