(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform suggests a negative outlook for Apple, particularly due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically lead to a bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of an earnings report where expectations may already be high. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the 'Magnificent Seven' are seen as safe assets, which could be a positive for Apple's stock, the article also suggests that this perception leads to lower expected returns and companies spending money on each other, potentially resulting in 'pretty low returns'. The mention of DeepSeek's AI and its potential impact on the tech sector introduces uncertainty. Overall, the news leans slightly negative due to the concerns about low returns and the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor, but the 'safe asset' perception provides some support. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'.  He lists several potential factors contributing to this negative outlook: weak Chinese phone orders, lack of AI boost, slowing service revenue, poor Vision Pro sales, and a significant downward revision to the forecast.  However, he also advises against trading the stock and recommends holding, citing Apple's strong management and historical performance.  His overall message is mixed: a highly negative expectation for the earnings report, but a long-term positive outlook on the company itself.  The market's reaction will depend on how the actual earnings compare to these already very low expectations. A beat could lead to a significant rise, while a miss (even a small one) could trigger a substantial fall. Given the already extremely negative sentiment baked into the prediction, the probability of a price fall is higher, but the magnitude of the movement is uncertain. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights concerns about their dominance in the market. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and low cost of capital. The mention of a tech sell-off triggered by news from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple is part of this group, the overall tone of the article is cautious, implying potential headwinds for Big Tech stocks. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams may mitigate some of the downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling artificial intelligence (AI) features. This downgrade is likely to have a negative impact on the stock price as it reduces investor confidence. Typically, downgrades by reputable analysts can lead to a decrease in stock price as investors adjust their expectations. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While O'Leary's investment strategy focuses on quality companies with strong financial performance, diverse portfolios, and dividend-paying stocks, the article does not explicitly state that AAPL is one of his top picks. However, AAPL is mentioned as a well-established company with a strong balance sheet and a history of consistent dividend growth. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL from $240 to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing a favorable environment for IT spending in 2025. Additionally, AAPL reported a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Considering these positive factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the AI development landscape due to DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. Snowflake CEO suggests that this could challenge assumptions about the high costs associated with AI training. The news indicates that Nvidia's stock has been significantly affected, dropping 16.97%, reflecting investor concerns. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak remains optimistic about Apple, noting that Apple's AI strategy is less capital-intensive compared to other major players. This could position Apple more favorably in investors' eyes, potentially leading to a rise in AAPL's stock price.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
