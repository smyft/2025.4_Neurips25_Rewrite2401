(AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\n\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform suggests a negative outlook for Apple, particularly due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically lead to a bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of an earnings report where expectations may already be high. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the 'Magnificent Seven' are seen as safe assets, which could be a positive for Apple's stock, the article also suggests that this perception leads to lower expected returns and companies spending money on each other, potentially resulting in 'pretty low returns'. The mention of DeepSeek's AI and its potential impact on the tech sector introduces uncertainty. Overall, the news leans slightly negative due to the concerns about low returns and the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor, but the 'safe asset' perception provides some support. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'.  He lists several potential factors contributing to this negative outlook: weak Chinese phone orders, lack of AI boost, slowing service revenue, poor Vision Pro sales, and a significant downward revision to the forecast.  However, he also advises against trading the stock and recommends holding, citing Apple's strong management and historical performance.  His overall message is mixed: a highly negative expectation for the earnings report, but a long-term positive outlook on the company itself.  The market's reaction will depend on how the actual earnings compare to these already very low expectations. A beat could lead to a significant rise, while a miss (even a small one) could trigger a substantial fall. Given the already extremely negative sentiment baked into the prediction, the probability of a price fall is higher, but the magnitude of the movement is uncertain. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights concerns about their dominance in the market. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and low cost of capital. The mention of a tech sell-off triggered by news from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple is part of this group, the overall tone of the article is cautious, implying potential headwinds for Big Tech stocks. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams may mitigate some of the downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling artificial intelligence (AI) features. This downgrade is likely to have a negative impact on the stock price as it reduces investor confidence. Typically, downgrades by reputable analysts can lead to a decrease in stock price as investors adjust their expectations. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While O'Leary's investment strategy focuses on quality companies with strong financial performance, diverse portfolios, and dividend-paying stocks, the article does not explicitly state that AAPL is one of his top picks. However, AAPL is mentioned as a well-established company with a strong balance sheet and a history of consistent dividend growth. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL from $240 to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing a favorable environment for IT spending in 2025. Additionally, AAPL reported a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Considering these positive factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the AI development landscape due to DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. Snowflake CEO suggests that this could challenge assumptions about the high costs associated with AI training. The news indicates that Nvidia's stock has been significantly affected, dropping 16.97%, reflecting investor concerns. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak remains optimistic about Apple, noting that Apple's AI strategy is less capital-intensive compared to other major players. This could position Apple more favorably in investors' eyes, potentially leading to a rise in AAPL's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple, primarily due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. This downgrade is likely to lead to bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of the earnings report where expectations may already be high. The previous predictions also reflect a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts citing negative factors impacting Apple's outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a nuanced view of Apple's position within the 'Magnificent Seven.' While being considered a 'safe asset' is generally positive, the article highlights concerns about lower expected returns due to excessive spending and the 'snake eating its own tail' dynamic. The mention of DeepSeek's AI and its potential impact on the tech sector adds uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a fall due to downgrades and negative sentiment, while others see potential for a rise based on AI strategies and analyst optimism. Given the conflicting signals and the overall cautious tone of the article, I'm slightly leaning towards a fall, but not as heavily as some previous predictions. The 'safe asset' perception provides some buffer against a significant drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings is the dominant factor in this analysis.  While he advises holding rather than trading, the extremely negative pre-earnings sentiment he expresses suggests a high probability of a negative market reaction if the results even slightly miss expectations.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall.  However, the fact that the disappointment is already largely priced in could limit the downside.  A significant positive surprise, however, is less likely given Cramer's strong negative prediction.  Considering the already low expectations and the potential for a limited downside, the probability of a price fall is higher, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and uses the metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' to describe their current market behavior. This suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and low cost of capital.

However, the most recent predictions and the article's content suggest a positive outlook for AAPL, leading me to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the AI development landscape due to DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. Snowflake CEO suggests that this could challenge assumptions about the high costs associated with AI training. The news indicates that Nvidia's stock has been significantly affected, dropping 16.97%, reflecting investor concerns.

This could position Apple more favorably in investors' eyes, potentially leading to a rise in AAPL's stock price. The previous predictions indicate mixed sentiments with most leaning towards a slight probability of falling stock prices.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple, primarily due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. This downgrade is likely to lead to bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of the earnings report where expectations may already be high. Previous predictions reflect a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts citing negative factors impacting Apple's outlook. While there are some mixed signals regarding Apple's fundamentals and potential for long-term growth, the immediate impact of the downgrade and the cautious market sentiment suggest a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the 'Magnificent Seven' and their potential unsustainability due to internal spending and reliance on each other. While Apple is considered a 'safe asset,' this perception leads to lower expected returns. The DeepSeek AI news adds to the tech sector's uncertainty. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to downgrades and negative sentiment, but some see potential for a rise based on AI strategies and analyst optimism. Considering the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor and the general cautious tone, I'm leaning towards a fall, but the 'safe asset' status provides some buffer. The trend of previous predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising, but the negative sentiment still persists. Therefore, I will adjust my prediction accordingly, but still maintain a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a highly conflicting picture. Jim Cramer, while predicting a widely anticipated disappointment, also advises against trading and recommends holding, highlighting Apple's strong management and historical performance.  This suggests that much of the negative sentiment is already priced in.  The previous predictions show a wide range, with some models predicting a high probability of a fall (as low as 0.25) and others a higher probability of a rise (as high as 0.7).  The consensus leans slightly towards a fall, but the variance is significant.  Cramer's extremely negative prediction, however, is a strong bearish signal.  Considering the already low expectations set by Cramer and the mixed signals from other analysts and previous predictions, I believe the probability of a price fall is higher, but not overwhelmingly so. A significant positive surprise is unlikely given the pre-existing negative sentiment. The probability of a fall is likely to be higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the movement is uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

While there are mixed views from various models regarding Apple's stock price movement, the overall sentiment seems balanced. Factors such as Apple's strong fundamentals, diversified revenue streams, and its less capital-intensive approach to AI are seen as positive aspects.

(AAPL), and highlights the company's strong balance sheet and history of consistent dividend growth. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL from $240 to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing a favorable environment for IT spending in 2025. Additionally, AAPL reported a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. However, the article also mentions the potential risks and uncertainties in the tech sector.

The previous predictions indicate a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall due to negative sentiment and downgrades, while others predict a higher probability of a stock price rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals and favorable environment for IT spending.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Is Apple Inc.
