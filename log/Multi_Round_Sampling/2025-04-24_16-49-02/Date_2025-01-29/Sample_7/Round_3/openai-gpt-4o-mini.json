A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform suggests a negative outlook for Apple, particularly due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically lead to a bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of an earnings report where expectations may already be high. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the 'Magnificent Seven' are seen as safe assets, which could be a positive for Apple's stock, the article also suggests that this perception leads to lower expected returns and companies spending money on each other, potentially resulting in 'pretty low returns'. The mention of DeepSeek's AI and its potential impact on the tech sector introduces uncertainty. Overall, the news leans slightly negative due to the concerns about low returns and the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor, but the 'safe asset' perception provides some support. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'.  He lists several potential factors contributing to this negative outlook: weak Chinese phone orders, lack of AI boost, slowing service revenue, poor Vision Pro sales, and a significant downward revision to the forecast.  However, he also advises against trading the stock and recommends holding, citing Apple's strong management and historical performance.  His overall message is mixed: a highly negative expectation for the earnings report, but a long-term positive outlook on the company itself.  The market's reaction will depend on how the actual earnings compare to these already very low expectations. A beat could lead to a significant rise, while a miss (even a small one) could trigger a substantial fall. Given the already extremely negative sentiment baked into the prediction, the probability of a price fall is higher, but the magnitude of the movement is uncertain. \nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights concerns about their dominance in the market. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and low cost of capital. The mention of a tech sell-off triggered by news from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple is part of this group, the overall tone of the article is cautious, implying potential headwinds for Big Tech stocks. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams may mitigate some of the downside risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) was downgraded by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform, citing competition in China and a lack of compelling artificial intelligence (AI) features. This downgrade is likely to have a negative impact on the stock price as it reduces investor confidence. Typically, downgrades by reputable analysts can lead to a decrease in stock price as investors adjust their expectations. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article discusses Kevin O'Leary's stock picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). While O'Leary's investment strategy focuses on quality companies with strong financial performance, diverse portfolios, and dividend-paying stocks, the article does not explicitly state that AAPL is one of his top picks. However, AAPL is mentioned as a well-established company with a strong balance sheet and a history of consistent dividend growth. Bernstein raised its price target for AAPL from $240 to $260 and maintained an Outperform rating, citing a favorable environment for IT spending in 2025. Additionally, AAPL reported a 6% increase in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024. Considering these positive factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the AI development landscape due to DeepSeek's cheaper AI model. Snowflake CEO suggests that this could challenge assumptions about the high costs associated with AI training. The news indicates that Nvidia's stock has been significantly affected, dropping 16.97%, reflecting investor concerns. However, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak remains optimistic about Apple, noting that Apple's AI strategy is less capital-intensive compared to other major players. This could position Apple more favorably in investors' eyes, potentially leading to a rise in AAPL's stock price.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform indicates a negative sentiment towards Apple, primarily due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. This downgrade is likely to lead to bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of the earnings report where expectations may already be high. The previous predictions also reflect a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts citing negative factors impacting Apple's outlook. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article presents a nuanced view of Apple's position within the 'Magnificent Seven.' While being considered a 'safe asset' is generally positive, the article highlights concerns about lower expected returns due to excessive spending and the 'snake eating its own tail' dynamic. The mention of DeepSeek's AI and its potential impact on the tech sector adds uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a fall due to downgrades and negative sentiment, while others see potential for a rise based on AI strategies and analyst optimism. Given the conflicting signals and the overall cautious tone of the article, I'm slightly leaning towards a fall, but not as heavily as some previous predictions. The 'safe asset' perception provides some buffer against a significant drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings is the dominant factor in this analysis.  While he advises holding rather than trading, the extremely negative pre-earnings sentiment he expresses suggests a high probability of a negative market reaction if the results even slightly miss expectations.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall.  However, the fact that the disappointment is already largely priced in could limit the downside.  A significant positive surprise, however, is less likely given Cramer's strong negative prediction.  Considering the already low expectations and the potential for a limited downside, the probability of a price fall is higher, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and uses the metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' to describe their current market behavior. This suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and low cost of capital. The mention of a tech sell-off triggered by news from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple is part of this group, the overall tone of the article is cautious, implying potential headwinds for Big Tech stocks.

However, the most recent predictions and the article's content suggest a positive outlook for AAPL, leading me to estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a potential shift in the AI development landscape due to DeepSeek's cheaper AI model.

This downgrade is likely to lead to bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of the earnings report where expectations may already be high. Previous predictions reflect a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many analysts citing negative factors impacting Apple's outlook. While there are some mixed signals regarding Apple's fundamentals and potential for long-term growth, the immediate impact of the downgrade and the cautious market sentiment suggest a higher likelihood of a price decline.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The news focuses on the 'Magnificent Seven' and their potential unsustainability due to internal spending and reliance on each other. While Apple is considered a 'safe asset,' this perception leads to lower expected returns. The DeepSeek AI news adds to the tech sector's uncertainty. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to downgrades and negative sentiment, but some see potential for a rise based on AI strategies and analyst optimism. Considering the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor and the general cautious tone, I'm leaning towards a fall, but the 'safe asset' status provides some buffer. The trend of previous predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising, but the negative sentiment still persists. Therefore, I will adjust my prediction accordingly, but still maintain a higher probability of the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news presents a highly conflicting picture. Jim Cramer, while predicting a widely anticipated disappointment, also advises against trading and recommends holding, highlighting Apple's strong management and historical performance.  This suggests that much of the negative sentiment is already priced in.  The previous predictions show a wide range, with some models predicting a high probability of a fall (as low as 0.25) and others a higher probability of a rise (as high as 0.7).  The consensus leans slightly towards a fall, but the variance is significant.  Cramer's extremely negative prediction, however, is a strong bearish signal.  Considering the already low expectations set by Cramer and the mixed signals from other analysts and previous predictions, I believe the probability of a price fall is higher, but not overwhelmingly so. A significant positive surprise is unlikely given the pre-existing negative sentiment. The probability of a fall is likely to be higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the movement is uncertain.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, including Apple Inc.
