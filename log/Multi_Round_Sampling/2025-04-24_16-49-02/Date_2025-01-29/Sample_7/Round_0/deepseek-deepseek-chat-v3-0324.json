The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests that these companies are viewed as safe assets, leading to lower expected returns due to excessive spending and low cost of capital. The mention of a tech sell-off triggered by news from DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple is part of this group, the overall tone of the article is cautious, implying potential headwinds for Big Tech stocks. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams may mitigate some of the downside risks.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
