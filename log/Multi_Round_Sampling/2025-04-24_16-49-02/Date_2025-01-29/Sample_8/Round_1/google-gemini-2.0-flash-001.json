      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer as iPhone Sales Slow, China Market Shrinks\nNews Content: Jan 29- Shares of Tech Gaint Apple (AAPL, Financial) remained low on early trading on Wednesday, losing 1.5%share value after Oppenheimer downgraded shares from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", saying longer-term prospects are weaker than previously expected on iPhone sales projections that have come in weaker than polled estimates and increasing competition in China. The firm also tweaked its view on Apple's valuation and short-term growth prospects, cutting its previous $250 price target due to worries about the firm.\n\nThe EBITDA margin, however, climbed year on year, and Oppenheimer cut the fiscal year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 4% to $7.95, below the consensus estimate of $8.23. Firm drops Apple revenue forecast to $438 billion in FY26 from $456 billion. The revisions were blamed on iPhone demand slowdown, and analysts lowered their projected shipment growth for FY25 to 2% from 5% and kept an outlook of 2% for FY26.\n\nApple's falling market share in China is a major concern: iPhone shipments in Q4 dropped 25%, and the full year 2024 fell 17% for the iPhone, Canalys said. With local Android manufacturers pressuring Apple's dominance, market share dropped from 19% to 15%.\n\nApple will likely struggle to maintain premium valuation and revenue momentum in the years ahead as it battles with competitive headwinds and sluggish iPhone sales, analysts warn.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Apple is set to report earnings soon, and while there are concerns about AI spending due to the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek, the general recovery in tech stocks, particularly after Nvidia's significant rebound, suggests a positive outlook. Additionally, ASML's strong demand report may bolster confidence in the tech sector. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, although some uncertainty remains due to the broader market dynamics and potential concerns from the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with lowered price target and revenue forecasts, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term growth. The primary drivers are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce the bearish outlook. While EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'.  He lists several potential factors contributing to this negative outlook: weak Chinese phone orders, lack of AI boost, slowing service revenue, poor Vision Pro sales, and a significant downward revision to the forecast.  However, he also advises against trading the stock and recommends holding, citing Apple's strong management and historical performance.  His overall message is mixed: a highly negative expectation for the earnings report, but a long-term positive outlook on the company itself.  The conflicting signals make it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  The market's reaction will likely depend on how the actual earnings compare to the already very low expectations set by Cramer and the broader market. A beat on expectations, however slight, could lead to a price rise, while a miss could trigger a significant fall. Given the already heavily negative sentiment, a small positive surprise might have a larger impact than a small negative surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI. Positive EPS growth generally signals strong financial health and can lead to increased investor confidence. Given the scale of the investment and its impact on EPS, the market is likely to react positively. However, without specific details on the nature of the investment or potential risks, the probability of a rise is tempered slightly. The probability of a fall is low, as the news is overwhelmingly positive, but market volatility or unforeseen factors could still play a role.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's $725 billion investment in share buybacks, which has significantly contributed to its growth by reducing the outstanding share count and increasing EPS. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 may impact the stock price. Despite the positive effects of share buybacks, the stock's valuation and stagnant product sales could weigh on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, where he anticipates a widely expected disappointment. Despite this, Cramer advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. He notes that historically, it has been more beneficial to hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it. Given Cramer's mixed views, with a negative short-term outlook but a positive long-term perspective, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated. The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher in the short term. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's advice to hold, the probability of a significant fall is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive earnings reports and projections from ASML, a key supplier to major tech companies including Apple. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about AI model cost-effectiveness is likely to boost investor confidence in the broader semiconductor sector, which includes Apple. While geopolitical concerns remain, the overall tone of the news is positive for the industry.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
