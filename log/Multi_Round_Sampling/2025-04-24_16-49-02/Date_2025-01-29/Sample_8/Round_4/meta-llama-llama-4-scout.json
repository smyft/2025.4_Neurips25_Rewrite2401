(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\nNews Content: It's a good time to be a bull on Wall Street. Since the start of 2023, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-inspired Nasdaq Composite have respectively soared by 34%, 59%, and 91%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 24, 2025.\n\nInvestors haven't hurt for catalysts, with a softening in the prevailing rate of inflation, better-than-expected corporate earnings, and Donald Trump's return to the White House helping to lift equities. But topping the list of factors that have sparked this bull market rally is the ascension of artificial intelligence (AI).Image source: Apple.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's most-influential businesses have leaned on AI as a way to fuel their growth, one of Wall Street's biggest businesses, tech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has put $725 billion to work elsewhere to boost its bottom line.\n\nApple is one of Wall Street's largest businesses for a reason (and AI is part of it)\n\nApple was the very first public company to top $3 trillion in market value, and as of this past weekend was the second-largest company, behind only Nvidia. Apple has consistently led Wall Street higher for years -- and its success is no accident.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone is the premier smartphone domestically. Since rolling out the first 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple's share of domestic smartphone sales has been 50% or higher. The ongoing upgrade of wireless networks to support 5G download speeds has led to relatively consistent demand for the company's iPhone.\n\nApple's innovation has also played a key role in sending its market cap to north of $3 trillion. This innovation includes physical products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as its ongoing transformation into a platforms company.\n\nFor years, CEO Tim Cook has overseen the push to promote subscription services. By focusing on subscriptions, Apple has an opportunity to lift its operating margin, improve its already impressive customer loyalty, and smooth out the revenue peaks and valleys that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles. Apple's Services segment has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage and now accounts for around a quarter of the company's net sales.\n\nLike most tech stocks, Apple is betting big on AI to power its top-and-bottom-line growth. Last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, which is its AI-driven personal intelligence model for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Intelligence can do everything from write and summarize text to create images for users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLastly, Apple's balance sheet is cash rich, which allows it to aggressively invest in its future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis $725 billion investment has been crucial to Apple's profit growth\n\nWhile this confluence of factors has helped Apple become the company it is today, arguably the greatest driver of Apple's growth in earnings per share (EPS) hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm talking about Apple's single greatest investment: stock repurchases.\n\nIn 2013, Apple's board kicked off a share buyback program that quickly became the envy of the investing word. Here's a breakdown of Apple's repurchasing activity in each of its last 11 fiscal years (its fiscal year typically ends in late September):\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion 2024: $94.949 billion\n\nCollectively, Apple has bought back $725.69 billion of its shares spanning 11 years and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% in the process. To put this into some context, the $6.08 in EPS Apple reported in fiscal 2024 would have equated to just $3.47 in EPS if the board hadn't authorized any share buybacks.AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts.\n\nAn ongoing share repurchase program serves a number of purposes for Apple. For one, as noted, it reduces the company's outstanding share count, which can increase EPS and make the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nSecondly, buyback programs tend to incentivize long-term investing. When a company's outstanding share count declines by a considerable amount over time, it incrementally increases the ownership stakes of investors. When investors buy and hold, it typically reduces share price volatility, which can also make a stock more attractive to investors.\n\nAnd third, buybacks intimate that Apple's insiders (the board and management team) believe shares of their company remain attractively valued.\n\nNot even Apple's world-leading buyback program can mask these issues\n\nWith more cash than Apple knows what to do with on its balance sheet (and generated from its operations), there's no end in sight to this world-leading buyback program.\n\nBut just because Apple is buying back its shares at a breakneck pace, it doesn't necessarily mean its stock is a good value. Billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in its top holding, Apple, over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30) -- and there are two good reasons why this selling is likely taking place.AAPL Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nFirst off, Apple's physical product sales have stalled out for two years. Even though iPhone remains the top-selling smartphone in the U.S., stagnant sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other wearables suggest consumers aren't being wowed by the company's physical products in the same way they have in the past. Though it's possible the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac will turn these fortunes around, not even historically high inflation helped Apple grow sales of its physical product lines in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe other prominent concern with Apple is that its stock is historically pricey. Despite its aggressive share buybacks, Apple recently hit a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 42, which is a level that hasn't been witnessed in 17 years. The stock market is itself pushing the envelope on the valuation front, and Apple's premium is even more pronounced.\n\nThough Apple's share repurchases are bound to continue, there's a lot of work to be done with the company's physical products before its current valuation makes sense.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Apple is set to report earnings soon, and while there are concerns about AI spending due to the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek, the general recovery in tech stocks, particularly after Nvidia's significant rebound, suggests a positive outlook. Additionally, ASML's strong demand report may bolster confidence in the tech sector. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, although some uncertainty remains due to the broader market dynamics and potential concerns from the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with lowered price target and revenue forecasts, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term growth. The primary drivers are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce the bearish outlook. While EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'.  He lists several potential factors contributing to this negative outlook: weak Chinese phone orders, lack of AI boost, slowing service revenue, poor Vision Pro sales, and a significant downward revision to the forecast.  However, he also advises against trading the stock and recommends holding, citing Apple's strong management and historical performance.  His overall message is mixed: a highly negative expectation for the earnings report, but a long-term positive outlook on the company itself.  The conflicting signals make it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  The market's reaction will likely depend on how the actual earnings compare to the already very low expectations set by Cramer and the broader market. A beat on expectations, however slight, could lead to a price rise, while a miss could trigger a significant fall. Given the already heavily negative sentiment, a small positive surprise might have a larger impact than a small negative surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI. Positive EPS growth generally signals strong financial health and can lead to increased investor confidence. Given the scale of the investment and its impact on EPS, the market is likely to react positively. However, without specific details on the nature of the investment or potential risks, the probability of a rise is tempered slightly. The probability of a fall is low, as the news is overwhelmingly positive, but market volatility or unforeseen factors could still play a role.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's $725 billion investment in share buybacks, which has significantly contributed to its growth by reducing the outstanding share count and increasing EPS. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 may impact the stock price. Despite the positive effects of share buybacks, the stock's valuation and stagnant product sales could weigh on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, where he anticipates a widely expected disappointment. Despite this, Cramer advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. He notes that historically, it has been more beneficial to hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it. Given Cramer's mixed views, with a negative short-term outlook but a positive long-term perspective, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated. The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher in the short term. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's advice to hold, the probability of a significant fall is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive earnings reports and projections from ASML, a key supplier to major tech companies including Apple. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about AI model cost-effectiveness is likely to boost investor confidence in the broader semiconductor sector, which includes Apple. While geopolitical concerns remain, the overall tone of the news is positive for the industry.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. While there are concerns regarding AI spending due to the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek, the recovery in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia's significant rebound, suggests a positive outlook. Apple's upcoming earnings report is critical, and while there are mixed sentiments about potential disappointments, the strong performance of ASML and the general recovery in tech sentiment may provide some support. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, tempered by the potential for a negative reaction to the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, reduced price target, and lowered revenue forecasts all point to a bearish outlook. The primary concerns are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce this negative sentiment. While the EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the negative news seems to be gaining more weight. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings is the dominant factor in this analysis.  While he advises holding the stock long-term due to Apple's strong fundamentals and management, his short-term outlook is overwhelmingly negative.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings.  The consensus seems to lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not a catastrophic one, given the already low expectations.  Cramer's statement suggests the market has already priced in much of the potential bad news.  A slight positive surprise could lead to a price increase, while a significant miss could cause a larger drop. Considering the already baked-in negative sentiment and the potential for a positive surprise, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, although the probability of a fall remains higher. The previous predictions' range and the mixed signals from Cramer's statement contribute to the uncertainty reflected in the probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI. Positive EPS growth generally signals strong financial health and can lead to increased investor confidence. However, previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models emphasizing concerns about stagnant product sales, high P/E ratios, and negative short-term outlooks from analysts like Jim Cramer. The scale of the investment and its impact on EPS suggest a positive market reaction, but the mixed signals from other models and potential underlying concerns temper the optimism slightly. Therefore, the probability of a rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible due to potential market volatility and lingering concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment in share buybacks, which has driven growth and boosted earnings per share (EPS). This investment has reduced the outstanding share count by almost 43% over 11 years, making the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 may impact the stock price. Additionally, the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac could potentially turn around fortunes, but the lack of AI-related growth drivers might be a concern. Given these factors, the stock price is likely to experience a moderate increase due to the positive effects of share buybacks and the company's cash-rich balance sheet, but the high valuation and stagnant product sales might limit the upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, where he anticipates a widely expected disappointment.

The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher in the short term. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's advice to hold, the probability of a significant fall is not extremely high. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a wide range of opinions, from a high probability of the stock price rising to a high probability of it falling, indicating uncertainty and the need for a balanced assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple as a major user of such technology. Multiple models predict varied levels of stock price movement, with some indicating a more cautious optimism due to broader market dynamics and the potential impact of Apple's upcoming earnings report. The overall sentiment seems to be cautiously positive for the tech sector, with ASML's success signaling stronger demand for tech hardware. However, specific concerns around Apple, like geopolitical issues and mixed earnings expectations, temper the positivity.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision.

Oppenheimer's downgrade, the lowered price target, and the reduced revenue forecasts all point to a bearish outlook. The primary drivers are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce this negative sentiment. While the EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share.

The trend of previous predictions also indicates a shift towards a more negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings is a significant negative factor.  However, he also advises holding the stock long-term, highlighting Apple's strong management and historical performance. This creates a mixed signal.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming earnings report.  The market seems to have already priced in some negative expectations, as evidenced by the relatively low probabilities of a significant price drop in several previous predictions.  A slight positive surprise could lead to a price increase, while a significant miss could cause a larger drop. Considering the already baked-in negative sentiment and the potential for a positive surprise, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but not a drastic one. The overall uncertainty and mixed signals lead to probabilities closer to 50/50, leaning slightly bearish due to Cramer's strong negative prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI.

Considering the wide range of opinions from previous predictions and the mixed signals from the news, a balanced assessment is necessary. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling, primarily due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report and concerns about stagnant product sales and high valuation. Nevertheless, the strong fundamentals of the company and the potential for a positive surprise in the earnings report temper the pessimism, leading to a moderate probability of a price fall rather than a catastrophic one.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple as a major user of such technology.
