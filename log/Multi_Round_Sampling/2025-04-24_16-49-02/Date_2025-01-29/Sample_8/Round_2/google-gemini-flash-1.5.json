(AAPL): \u2018We Have The Most Widely Anticipated Disappointment That I\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Apple is set to report earnings soon, and while there are concerns about AI spending due to the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek, the general recovery in tech stocks, particularly after Nvidia's significant rebound, suggests a positive outlook. Additionally, ASML's strong demand report may bolster confidence in the tech sector. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, although some uncertainty remains due to the broader market dynamics and potential concerns from the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with lowered price target and revenue forecasts, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term growth. The primary drivers are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce the bearish outlook. While EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'.  He lists several potential factors contributing to this negative outlook: weak Chinese phone orders, lack of AI boost, slowing service revenue, poor Vision Pro sales, and a significant downward revision to the forecast.  However, he also advises against trading the stock and recommends holding, citing Apple's strong management and historical performance.  His overall message is mixed: a highly negative expectation for the earnings report, but a long-term positive outlook on the company itself.  The conflicting signals make it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  The market's reaction will likely depend on how the actual earnings compare to the already very low expectations set by Cramer and the broader market. A beat on expectations, however slight, could lead to a price rise, while a miss could trigger a significant fall. Given the already heavily negative sentiment, a small positive surprise might have a larger impact than a small negative surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI. Positive EPS growth generally signals strong financial health and can lead to increased investor confidence. Given the scale of the investment and its impact on EPS, the market is likely to react positively. However, without specific details on the nature of the investment or potential risks, the probability of a rise is tempered slightly. The probability of a fall is low, as the news is overwhelmingly positive, but market volatility or unforeseen factors could still play a role.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's $725 billion investment in share buybacks, which has significantly contributed to its growth by reducing the outstanding share count and increasing EPS. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 may impact the stock price. Despite the positive effects of share buybacks, the stock's valuation and stagnant product sales could weigh on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, where he anticipates a widely expected disappointment. Despite this, Cramer advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. He notes that historically, it has been more beneficial to hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it. Given Cramer's mixed views, with a negative short-term outlook but a positive long-term perspective, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated. The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher in the short term. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's advice to hold, the probability of a significant fall is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive earnings reports and projections from ASML, a key supplier to major tech companies including Apple. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about AI model cost-effectiveness is likely to boost investor confidence in the broader semiconductor sector, which includes Apple. While geopolitical concerns remain, the overall tone of the news is positive for the industry.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. While there are concerns regarding AI spending due to the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek, the recovery in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia's significant rebound, suggests a positive outlook. Apple's upcoming earnings report is critical, and while there are mixed sentiments about potential disappointments, the strong performance of ASML and the general recovery in tech sentiment may provide some support. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, tempered by the potential for a negative reaction to the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, reduced price target, and lowered revenue forecasts all point to a bearish outlook. The primary concerns are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce this negative sentiment. While the EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the negative news seems to be gaining more weight. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings is the dominant factor in this analysis.  While he advises holding the stock long-term due to Apple's strong fundamentals and management, his short-term outlook is overwhelmingly negative.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings.  The consensus seems to lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not a catastrophic one, given the already low expectations.  Cramer's statement suggests the market has already priced in much of the potential bad news.  A slight positive surprise could lead to a price increase, while a significant miss could cause a larger drop. Considering the already baked-in negative sentiment and the potential for a positive surprise, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, although the probability of a fall remains higher. The previous predictions' range and the mixed signals from Cramer's statement contribute to the uncertainty reflected in the probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI. Positive EPS growth generally signals strong financial health and can lead to increased investor confidence. However, previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models emphasizing concerns about stagnant product sales, high P/E ratios, and negative short-term outlooks from analysts like Jim Cramer. The scale of the investment and its impact on EPS suggest a positive market reaction, but the mixed signals from other models and potential underlying concerns temper the optimism slightly. Therefore, the probability of a rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible due to potential market volatility and lingering concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment in share buybacks, which has driven growth and boosted earnings per share (EPS). This investment has reduced the outstanding share count by almost 43% over 11 years, making the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 may impact the stock price. Additionally, the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac could potentially turn around fortunes, but the lack of AI-related growth drivers might be a concern. Given these factors, the stock price is likely to experience a moderate increase due to the positive effects of share buybacks and the company's cash-rich balance sheet, but the high valuation and stagnant product sales might limit the upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, where he anticipates a widely expected disappointment. Despite this, Cramer advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. Considering the mixed views from Cramer and the overall market sentiment, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated. The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher in the short term. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's advice to hold, the probability of a significant fall is not extremely high. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a wide range of opinions, from a high probability of the stock price rising to a high probability of it falling, indicating uncertainty and the need for a balanced assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple as a major user of such technology. Multiple models predict varied levels of stock price movement, with some indicating a more cautious optimism due to broader market dynamics and the potential impact of Apple's upcoming earnings report. The overall sentiment seems to be cautiously positive for the tech sector, with ASML's success signaling stronger demand for tech hardware. However, specific concerns around Apple, like geopolitical issues and mixed earnings expectations, temper the positivity.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
