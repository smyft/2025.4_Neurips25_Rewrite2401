(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. Apple is set to report earnings soon, and while there are concerns about AI spending due to the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek, the general recovery in tech stocks, particularly after Nvidia's significant rebound, suggests a positive outlook. Additionally, ASML's strong demand report may bolster confidence in the tech sector. Given these factors, there is a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, although some uncertainty remains due to the broader market dynamics and potential concerns from the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with lowered price target and revenue forecasts, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term growth. The primary drivers are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce the bearish outlook. While EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, a well-known but often controversial financial commentator, expresses extremely negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, predicting a 'widely anticipated disappointment'.  He lists several potential factors contributing to this negative outlook: weak Chinese phone orders, lack of AI boost, slowing service revenue, poor Vision Pro sales, and a significant downward revision to the forecast.  However, he also advises against trading the stock and recommends holding, citing Apple's strong management and historical performance.  His overall message is mixed: a highly negative expectation for the earnings report, but a long-term positive outlook on the company itself.  The conflicting signals make it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  The market's reaction will likely depend on how the actual earnings compare to the already very low expectations set by Cramer and the broader market. A beat on expectations, however slight, could lead to a price rise, while a miss could trigger a significant fall. Given the already heavily negative sentiment, a small positive surprise might have a larger impact than a small negative surprise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI. Positive EPS growth generally signals strong financial health and can lead to increased investor confidence. Given the scale of the investment and its impact on EPS, the market is likely to react positively. However, without specific details on the nature of the investment or potential risks, the probability of a rise is tempered slightly. The probability of a fall is low, as the news is overwhelmingly positive, but market volatility or unforeseen factors could still play a role.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's $725 billion investment in share buybacks, which has significantly contributed to its growth by reducing the outstanding share count and increasing EPS. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 may impact the stock price. Despite the positive effects of share buybacks, the stock's valuation and stagnant product sales could weigh on investor sentiment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, where he anticipates a widely expected disappointment. Despite this, Cramer advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. He notes that historically, it has been more beneficial to hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it. Given Cramer's mixed views, with a negative short-term outlook but a positive long-term perspective, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated. The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher in the short term. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's advice to hold, the probability of a significant fall is not extremely high.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive earnings reports and projections from ASML, a key supplier to major tech companies including Apple. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about AI model cost-effectiveness is likely to boost investor confidence in the broader semiconductor sector, which includes Apple. While geopolitical concerns remain, the overall tone of the news is positive for the industry.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. While there are concerns regarding AI spending due to the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek, the recovery in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia's significant rebound, suggests a positive outlook. Apple's upcoming earnings report is critical, and while there are mixed sentiments about potential disappointments, the strong performance of ASML and the general recovery in tech sentiment may provide some support. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, tempered by the potential for a negative reaction to the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, reduced price target, and lowered revenue forecasts all point to a bearish outlook. The primary concerns are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce this negative sentiment. While the EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the negative news seems to be gaining more weight. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings is the dominant factor in this analysis.  While he advises holding the stock long-term due to Apple's strong fundamentals and management, his short-term outlook is overwhelmingly negative.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's upcoming earnings.  The consensus seems to lean towards a higher probability of a price fall, but not a catastrophic one, given the already low expectations.  Cramer's statement suggests the market has already priced in much of the potential bad news.  A slight positive surprise could lead to a price increase, while a significant miss could cause a larger drop. Considering the already baked-in negative sentiment and the potential for a positive surprise, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, although the probability of a fall remains higher. The previous predictions' range and the mixed signals from Cramer's statement contribute to the uncertainty reflected in the probabilities.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI. Positive EPS growth generally signals strong financial health and can lead to increased investor confidence. However, previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models emphasizing concerns about stagnant product sales, high P/E ratios, and negative short-term outlooks from analysts like Jim Cramer. The scale of the investment and its impact on EPS suggest a positive market reaction, but the mixed signals from other models and potential underlying concerns temper the optimism slightly. Therefore, the probability of a rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible due to potential market volatility and lingering concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment in share buybacks, which has driven growth and boosted earnings per share (EPS). This investment has reduced the outstanding share count by almost 43% over 11 years, making the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 may impact the stock price. Additionally, the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac could potentially turn around fortunes, but the lack of AI-related growth drivers might be a concern. Given these factors, the stock price is likely to experience a moderate increase due to the positive effects of share buybacks and the company's cash-rich balance sheet, but the high valuation and stagnant product sales might limit the upside.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article features Jim Cramer's analysis of Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, where he anticipates a widely expected disappointment. Despite this, Cramer advises holding onto the stock due to the company's exceptional management and control over its future. Considering the mixed views from Cramer and the overall market sentiment, the probabilities of the stock price movement are estimated. The probability of the stock price rising is lower due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report, while the probability of the stock price falling is higher in the short term. However, considering Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's advice to hold, the probability of a significant fall is not extremely high. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a wide range of opinions, from a high probability of the stock price rising to a high probability of it falling, indicating uncertainty and the need for a balanced assessment.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple as a major user of such technology. Multiple models predict varied levels of stock price movement, with some indicating a more cautious optimism due to broader market dynamics and the potential impact of Apple's upcoming earnings report. The overall sentiment seems to be cautiously positive for the tech sector, with ASML's success signaling stronger demand for tech hardware. However, specific concerns around Apple, like geopolitical issues and mixed earnings expectations, temper the positivity.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The overall market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures rising ahead of key tech earnings and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision. While there are concerns regarding AI spending due to the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek, the recovery in tech stocks, particularly Nvidia's significant rebound, suggests a positive outlook. Apple's upcoming earnings report is critical, and while there are mixed sentiments about potential disappointments, the strong performance of ASML and the general recovery in tech sentiment may provide some support. However, analysts like Jim Cramer express concerns about a widely anticipated disappointment in Apple's earnings, which tempers the optimism. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, tempered by the potential for a negative reaction to the earnings report.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The news is clearly negative for Apple. Oppenheimer's downgrade, the lowered price target, and the reduced revenue forecasts all point to a bearish outlook. The primary drivers are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce this negative sentiment. While the EBITDA margin improved, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the negative news seems to be gaining more weight. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than it rising. The trend of previous predictions also indicates a shift towards a more negative outlook.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings is a significant negative factor.  However, he also advises holding the stock long-term, highlighting Apple's strong management and historical performance. This creates a mixed signal.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the upcoming earnings report.  The market seems to have already priced in some negative expectations, as evidenced by the relatively low probabilities of a significant price drop in several previous predictions.  A slight positive surprise could lead to a price increase, while a significant miss could cause a larger drop. Considering the already baked-in negative sentiment and the potential for a positive surprise, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but not a drastic one. The overall uncertainty and mixed signals lead to probabilities closer to 50/50, leaning slightly bearish due to Cramer's strong negative prediction.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's significant $725 billion investment, which is driving growth and boosting earnings per share (EPS), despite not being related to AI.

Therefore, the probability of a rise is moderately high, while the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible due to potential market volatility and lingering concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's significant $725 billion investment in share buybacks, which has driven growth and boosted earnings per share (EPS). This investment has reduced the outstanding share count by almost 43% over 11 years, making the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors. However, concerns about stagnant physical product sales, particularly in the crucial China market, and a historically high P/E ratio of over 42 may impact the stock price. The mixed views from analysts and commentators, such as Jim Cramer's anticipation of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' but advising to hold the stock, contribute to the uncertainty. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be moderate due to the positive effects of share buybacks and the company's cash-rich balance sheet, but tempered by potential risks and concerns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news and previous predictions indicates a mixed sentiment towards Apple's stock price movement. Jim Cramer's prediction of a 'widely anticipated disappointment' for Apple's earnings report contributes to a negative short-term outlook. However, his advice to hold the stock due to Apple's strong management and control over its future, along with the company's significant investment in share buybacks and positive EPS growth, suggests a long-term positive perspective. Considering the wide range of opinions from previous predictions and the mixed signals from the news, a balanced assessment is necessary. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling, primarily due to the anticipated disappointing earnings report and concerns about stagnant product sales and high valuation. Nevertheless, the strong fundamentals of the company and the potential for a positive surprise in the earnings report temper the pessimism, leading to a moderate probability of a price fall rather than a catastrophic one.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly benefits Apple as a major user of such technology. Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, indicating both positive and negative sentiments. The overall sentiment seems cautiously optimistic for the tech sector due to ASML's success, signaling stronger demand for tech hardware. However, specific concerns around Apple, like geopolitical issues and mixed earnings expectations, temper the positivity.
