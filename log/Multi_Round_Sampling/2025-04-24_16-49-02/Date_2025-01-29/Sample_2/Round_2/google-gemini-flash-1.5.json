(AAPL)\nNews Headline: ASML stock rises after earnings beat as CEO says DeepSeek will drive AI chip demand higher\nNews Content: ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on January 29, 2025.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction. While this is generally positive for the market as a whole, it does not specifically indicate any direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Investors may view this as a neutral signal, as it does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of a potentially cheaper and efficient AI chatbot from China (DeepSeek) could increase competition in the AI space, potentially impacting Apple's future AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised by the expert could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restrictions on data flow, which could indirectly affect Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests that DeepSeek's emergence could be 'good for the market overall,' implying potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the competitive threat and regulatory concerns outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings beat and positive outlook driven by AI chip demand.  While concerns about a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek initially caused a stock dip, ASML's CEO successfully countered this by arguing that lower AI costs will lead to increased applications and ultimately higher chip demand. This positive sentiment regarding ASML's future, coupled with the exceeding of revenue expectations, indirectly benefits Apple (AAPL) as a major customer of TSMC, which relies on ASML's equipment.  However, the impact on AAPL is indirect and less direct than the impact on ASML.  Therefore, while the news is positive for the semiconductor sector, the effect on AAPL's stock price is likely to be muted compared to ASML.  The probability of AAPL rising is therefore moderate, while the probability of it falling is low, given the overall positive market sentiment surrounding AI and the indirect positive impact on AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones, providing an alternative to Apple's existing Globalstar-based satellite service. This collaboration could enhance Apple's product offerings and potentially expand its market reach, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. The positive sentiment around this partnership, combined with Elon Musk's endorsement and the potential for future upgrades (like video support), is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock may be tempered by the fact that the service is currently in beta and limited to the US. The significant drop in Globalstar's shares suggests market perception of competitive pressure, but Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate any negative impact. Overall, the news is more likely to be seen as a positive development for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential as a stock to buy and hold in 2025, highlighting both positive and negative factors that could influence its stock price. On the positive side, Apple's proactive management, focus on AI integration, and strong services revenue stream are noted. Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $262. Additionally, investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch is mentioned. However, potential risks such as competition from Chinese manufacturers and economic uncertainties are also discussed. Overall, the article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's stock performance in 2025.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors. However, Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai suggests that this phenomenon is similar to a snake eating its own tail, where these companies are spending money on each other, leading to low expected returns. This analysis implies that the stock prices of these companies, including Apple, may not experience significant growth due to this self-sustaining cycle. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s position as a leader in the consumer electronics market, driven by continuous innovation and strong market demand. Despite some challenges such as a slowdown in iPhone sales and competition from Chinese brands, the introduction of AI-powered features like Apple Intelligence is expected to boost future growth. Additionally, the company's shift towards service-based revenue streams and positive views from analysts suggest a positive outlook. However, there are concerns related to economic challenges and geopolitical factors such as tariffs, which may introduce volatility.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction, which is generally positive for the market. However, it does not provide specific insights or direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions from previous rounds, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. The overall sentiment does not indicate a strong directional movement for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek AI in China, claiming lower development costs, poses a competitive threat to US tech companies like Apple, potentially impacting their AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised could lead to regulatory scrutiny and data flow restrictions, indirectly affecting Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment overall. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings and positive outlook driven by AI chip demand.  This is positive for Apple indirectly, as Apple is a major customer of TSMC, which relies on ASML's equipment.  The positive sentiment surrounding ASML's success in the face of concerns about cheaper AI models suggests continued strong demand for high-end chips. While the impact on AAPL is indirect, it's likely to be positive.  However, the effect is not direct and may be muted compared to the impact on ASML itself.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions, and the indirect nature of the news' impact on Apple, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a low probability of a fall. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in predicting stock price movements based on indirect news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones, providing an alternative to Apple's existing Globalstar-based satellite service. This collaboration is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product offerings and expands its market reach, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. The involvement of high-profile companies like SpaceX and T-Mobile, along with Elon Musk's endorsement, adds credibility and potential for future upgrades (e.g., video support). However, the immediate impact may be tempered by the service being in beta and limited to the US. The significant drop in Globalstar's shares suggests competitive pressure, but Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate any negative impact. Overall, the news is more likely to be seen as a positive development for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
