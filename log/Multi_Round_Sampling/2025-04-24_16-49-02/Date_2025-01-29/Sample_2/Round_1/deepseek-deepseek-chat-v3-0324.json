(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThe companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction. While this is generally positive for the market as a whole, it does not specifically indicate any direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Investors may view this as a neutral signal, as it does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of a potentially cheaper and efficient AI chatbot from China (DeepSeek) could increase competition in the AI space, potentially impacting Apple's future AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised by the expert could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restrictions on data flow, which could indirectly affect Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests that DeepSeek's emergence could be 'good for the market overall,' implying potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the competitive threat and regulatory concerns outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings beat and positive outlook driven by AI chip demand.  While concerns about a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek initially caused a stock dip, ASML's CEO successfully countered this by arguing that lower AI costs will lead to increased applications and ultimately higher chip demand. This positive sentiment regarding ASML's future, coupled with the exceeding of revenue expectations, indirectly benefits Apple (AAPL) as a major customer of TSMC, which relies on ASML's equipment.  However, the impact on AAPL is indirect and less direct than the impact on ASML.  Therefore, while the news is positive for the semiconductor sector, the effect on AAPL's stock price is likely to be muted compared to ASML.  The probability of AAPL rising is therefore moderate, while the probability of it falling is low, given the overall positive market sentiment surrounding AI and the indirect positive impact on AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones, providing an alternative to Apple's existing Globalstar-based satellite service. This collaboration could enhance Apple's product offerings and potentially expand its market reach, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. The positive sentiment around this partnership, combined with Elon Musk's endorsement and the potential for future upgrades (like video support), is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock may be tempered by the fact that the service is currently in beta and limited to the US. The significant drop in Globalstar's shares suggests market perception of competitive pressure, but Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate any negative impact. Overall, the news is more likely to be seen as a positive development for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential as a stock to buy and hold in 2025, highlighting both positive and negative factors that could influence its stock price. On the positive side, Apple's proactive management, focus on AI integration, and strong services revenue stream are noted. Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $262. Additionally, investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch is mentioned. However, potential risks such as competition from Chinese manufacturers and economic uncertainties are also discussed. Overall, the article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's stock performance in 2025.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors. However, Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai suggests that this phenomenon is similar to a snake eating its own tail, where these companies are spending money on each other, leading to low expected returns. This analysis implies that the stock prices of these companies, including Apple, may not experience significant growth due to this self-sustaining cycle. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s position as a leader in the consumer electronics market, driven by continuous innovation and strong market demand. Despite some challenges such as a slowdown in iPhone sales and competition from Chinese brands, the introduction of AI-powered features like Apple Intelligence is expected to boost future growth. Additionally, the company's shift towards service-based revenue streams and positive views from analysts suggest a positive outlook. However, there are concerns related to economic challenges and geopolitical factors such as tariffs, which may introduce volatility.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
