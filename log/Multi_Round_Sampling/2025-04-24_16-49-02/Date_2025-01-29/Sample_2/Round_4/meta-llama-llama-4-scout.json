(AAPL) the Best American Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nWill the Market Continue To Be Bullish in 2025?\n\nWall Street\u2019s outlook for the stock market in 2025 reflects a cautious optimism following two consecutive years of substantial gains. Analysts predict continued growth, however at a more moderate pace compared to the explosive increases of 2023 and 2024. According to a report by CNN, published on January 1, strategists anticipate a 14.8% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, which is significant but lower than the previous years\u2019 performances. The Index saw gains of approximately 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. As per the report 2025 marks a return to typical growth rates after an extraordinary period of high returns, which has not been seen since the late 1990s.\n\nWhile several factors are expected to contribute to the market growth, there are potential risks that can hinder it. One of the key factors contributing to growth is the anticipated business-friendly policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Dan Ives, who is a technology senior analyst at Wedbush Securities in his December 30 note mentioned his expectations that tech stocks can rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration. The analyst has picked Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks as his best performers for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential risks that could negatively impact the stock market. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy decisions may create a volatile environment for markets. Traders are particularly wary of how proposed tariffs could affect economic stability and investor confidence. David Sekera from Morningstar emphasizes that the implementation of tariffs is a significant wildcard that could sway market performance in either direction. We recently covered the analysis of Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company in our article titled, 12 High Growth International Stocks to Invest in Now. Here\u2019s a piece from our coverage:\n\n\u201cWhile talking about large-cap stock performance, Timmer raises the question of whether this trend of narrow leadership will persist. He suggested that trends continue to move in the same direction until a significant change occurs. Given that large-cap growth stocks have dominated for years, it is reasonable to assume that they may continue to lead. However, he also cautioned the investors that as per the concept of mean reversion, asset prices will eventually return to their historical averages and when this happens, it could lead to sharp corrections in stock prices. Timmer believes that while 2024 was a \u201cGoldilocks year,\u201d for earnings and valuations, this year can be a tussle between higher earnings and rising long-term interest rates, thereby resulting in a volatile market.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo get the list of the 10 best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. Using the database we ranked the top 10 American stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an international provider of smartphones, personal computers, and other technology gadgets. Based in America, the company is renowned for its iPhone, Mac, and iPad. On January 27, Rosenblatt Securities reiterated their Buy rating on the stock, keeping the price target of $262. The firm expects the ongoing December quarter to be a bit low due to slower sales of the iPhone as it continues to face challenges from other Chinese manufacturers.\n\nManagement has been proactive in dealing with this competition. They released Apple Intelligence in June last year. The new artificial intelligence will be integrated with upcoming models to enhance user experience and act as a competitive edge over its competitors. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also shifted its focus on the Apple Store and its services revenue stream. As a result, the company was able to generate a record $25 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of 2024, indicating a 12% increase year-over-year.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here\u2019s what it is said regarding the company in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction. While this is generally positive for the market as a whole, it does not specifically indicate any direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Investors may view this as a neutral signal, as it does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of a potentially cheaper and efficient AI chatbot from China (DeepSeek) could increase competition in the AI space, potentially impacting Apple's future AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised by the expert could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restrictions on data flow, which could indirectly affect Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests that DeepSeek's emergence could be 'good for the market overall,' implying potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the competitive threat and regulatory concerns outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings beat and positive outlook driven by AI chip demand.  While concerns about a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek initially caused a stock dip, ASML's CEO successfully countered this by arguing that lower AI costs will lead to increased applications and ultimately higher chip demand. This positive sentiment regarding ASML's future, coupled with the exceeding of revenue expectations, indirectly benefits Apple (AAPL) as a major customer of TSMC, which relies on ASML's equipment.  However, the impact on AAPL is indirect and less direct than the impact on ASML.  Therefore, while the news is positive for the semiconductor sector, the effect on AAPL's stock price is likely to be muted compared to ASML.  The probability of AAPL rising is therefore moderate, while the probability of it falling is low, given the overall positive market sentiment surrounding AI and the indirect positive impact on AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones, providing an alternative to Apple's existing Globalstar-based satellite service. This collaboration could enhance Apple's product offerings and potentially expand its market reach, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. The positive sentiment around this partnership, combined with Elon Musk's endorsement and the potential for future upgrades (like video support), is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock may be tempered by the fact that the service is currently in beta and limited to the US. The significant drop in Globalstar's shares suggests market perception of competitive pressure, but Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate any negative impact. Overall, the news is more likely to be seen as a positive development for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential as a stock to buy and hold in 2025, highlighting both positive and negative factors that could influence its stock price. On the positive side, Apple's proactive management, focus on AI integration, and strong services revenue stream are noted. Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $262. Additionally, investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch is mentioned. However, potential risks such as competition from Chinese manufacturers and economic uncertainties are also discussed. Overall, the article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's stock performance in 2025.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors. However, Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai suggests that this phenomenon is similar to a snake eating its own tail, where these companies are spending money on each other, leading to low expected returns. This analysis implies that the stock prices of these companies, including Apple, may not experience significant growth due to this self-sustaining cycle. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s position as a leader in the consumer electronics market, driven by continuous innovation and strong market demand. Despite some challenges such as a slowdown in iPhone sales and competition from Chinese brands, the introduction of AI-powered features like Apple Intelligence is expected to boost future growth. Additionally, the company's shift towards service-based revenue streams and positive views from analysts suggest a positive outlook. However, there are concerns related to economic challenges and geopolitical factors such as tariffs, which may introduce volatility.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction, which is generally positive for the market. However, it does not provide specific insights or direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions from previous rounds, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. The overall sentiment does not indicate a strong directional movement for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek AI in China, claiming lower development costs, poses a competitive threat to US tech companies like Apple, potentially impacting their AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised could lead to regulatory scrutiny and data flow restrictions, indirectly affecting Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment overall. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings and positive outlook driven by AI chip demand.  This is positive for Apple indirectly, as Apple is a major customer of TSMC, which relies on ASML's equipment.  The positive sentiment surrounding ASML's success in the face of concerns about cheaper AI models suggests continued strong demand for high-end chips. While the impact on AAPL is indirect, it's likely to be positive.  However, the effect is not direct and may be muted compared to the impact on ASML itself.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions, and the indirect nature of the news' impact on Apple, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a low probability of a fall. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in predicting stock price movements based on indirect news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones, providing an alternative to Apple's existing Globalstar-based satellite service. This collaboration is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product offerings and expands its market reach, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. The involvement of high-profile companies like SpaceX and T-Mobile, along with Elon Musk's endorsement, adds credibility and potential for future upgrades (e.g., video support). However, the immediate impact may be tempered by the service being in beta and limited to the US. The significant drop in Globalstar's shares suggests competitive pressure, but Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate any negative impact. Overall, the news is more likely to be seen as a positive development for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors.

Given the information, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong presence in the consumer electronics market, driven by continuous innovation and high market demand. The company's introduction of AI-powered features, such as Apple Intelligence, is expected to boost future growth. Although there are challenges like competition from Chinese brands and economic uncertainties, the overall positive outlook from various analysts and the strategic partnerships support a bullish sentiment. The news also mentions the positive impact of tariffs on a strong dollar, suggesting enhanced competitiveness. The majority of previous predictions indicate a higher probability of stock price rising, though with varying degrees of certainty.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction, which is generally positive for the market. However, it does not provide specific insights or direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL).

The emergence of DeepSeek AI in China, claiming lower development costs, poses a competitive threat to US tech companies like Apple, potentially impacting their AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised could lead to regulatory scrutiny and data flow restrictions, indirectly affecting Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment overall. The models are split, with some leaning positive due to indirect benefits from the semiconductor industry and others negative due to competition. Given the direct competitive threat and the geopolitical concerns, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not drastically so, as Apple is a large, diversified company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings, driven by increased AI chip demand.  This is indirectly positive for Apple, as ASML's equipment is crucial for TSMC, a major Apple chip supplier.  While the news is not directly about Apple, the positive sentiment surrounding ASML's success and the CEO's dismissal of concerns about cheaper AI models suggest continued strong demand for high-end chips, benefiting Apple indirectly.  However, the impact is indirect and less significant than the direct impact on ASML.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting uncertainty. Considering the indirect positive impact and the mixed previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a low probability of a fall. The fact that the news is about ASML and not directly about Apple tempers the positive impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones.

On the positive side, Apple's proactive management, focus on AI integration, and strong services revenue stream are noted. Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $262. Additionally, investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch is mentioned.

However, Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai suggests that this phenomenon is similar to a snake eating its own tail, where these companies are spending money on each other, leading to low expected returns.

However, it does not provide specific insights or direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions from previous rounds, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. The overall sentiment does not indicate a strong directional movement for AAPL's stock price, leading to a prediction of equal probabilities for rising and falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news regarding DeepSeek AI introduces a competitive threat to Apple in the AI space, particularly concerning cost efficiency. While innovation is generally positive, the national security concerns and potential data flow restrictions could negatively impact Apple's operations in China. Considering the mixed opinions in previous rounds, with a slight negative trend emerging, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified business model mitigate some of the negative impact. The previous predictions show a slight shift towards a more negative outlook, which I am incorporating into my prediction.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news is primarily focused on ASML, a key supplier to TSMC, which in turn supplies chips to Apple. ASML's strong earnings and positive outlook driven by AI chip demand are indirectly positive for Apple.  However, the impact is indirect and muted.  The CEO of ASML dismissing concerns about cheaper AI models from DeepSeek is a positive sign for the overall semiconductor industry, but doesn't guarantee increased demand for Apple's products.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering the indirect positive impact, the overall positive sentiment in the semiconductor sector, and the mixed previous predictions, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but it's not a strong signal. The potential for increased competition in the AI space, as highlighted by DeepSeek's advancements, introduces a degree of uncertainty and risk, preventing a significantly higher probability for a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones, providing an alternative to Apple's existing Globalstar-based satellite service.
