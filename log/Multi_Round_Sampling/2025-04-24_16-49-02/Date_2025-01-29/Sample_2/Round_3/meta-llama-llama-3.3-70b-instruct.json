(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction. While this is generally positive for the market as a whole, it does not specifically indicate any direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Investors may view this as a neutral signal, as it does not provide any specific information about Apple's performance or outlook. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of a potentially cheaper and efficient AI chatbot from China (DeepSeek) could increase competition in the AI space, potentially impacting Apple's future AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised by the expert could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny and potential restrictions on data flow, which could indirectly affect Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests that DeepSeek's emergence could be 'good for the market overall,' implying potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the competitive threat and regulatory concerns outweigh the potential benefits. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings beat and positive outlook driven by AI chip demand.  While concerns about a cost-effective AI model from DeepSeek initially caused a stock dip, ASML's CEO successfully countered this by arguing that lower AI costs will lead to increased applications and ultimately higher chip demand. This positive sentiment regarding ASML's future, coupled with the exceeding of revenue expectations, indirectly benefits Apple (AAPL) as a major customer of TSMC, which relies on ASML's equipment.  However, the impact on AAPL is indirect and less direct than the impact on ASML.  Therefore, while the news is positive for the semiconductor sector, the effect on AAPL's stock price is likely to be muted compared to ASML.  The probability of AAPL rising is therefore moderate, while the probability of it falling is low, given the overall positive market sentiment surrounding AI and the indirect positive impact on AAPL.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news indicates a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones, providing an alternative to Apple's existing Globalstar-based satellite service. This collaboration could enhance Apple's product offerings and potentially expand its market reach, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. The positive sentiment around this partnership, combined with Elon Musk's endorsement and the potential for future upgrades (like video support), is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. However, the immediate impact on Apple's stock may be tempered by the fact that the service is currently in beta and limited to the US. The significant drop in Globalstar's shares suggests market perception of competitive pressure, but Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate any negative impact. Overall, the news is more likely to be seen as a positive development for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article discusses Apple's potential as a stock to buy and hold in 2025, highlighting both positive and negative factors that could influence its stock price. On the positive side, Apple's proactive management, focus on AI integration, and strong services revenue stream are noted. Rosenblatt Securities reiterated a Buy rating with a price target of $262. Additionally, investor enthusiasm for Apple's AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch is mentioned. However, potential risks such as competition from Chinese manufacturers and economic uncertainties are also discussed. Overall, the article presents a cautiously optimistic view of Apple's stock performance in 2025.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors. However, Harvard Law professor Mihir Desai suggests that this phenomenon is similar to a snake eating its own tail, where these companies are spending money on each other, leading to low expected returns. This analysis implies that the stock prices of these companies, including Apple, may not experience significant growth due to this self-sustaining cycle. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s position as a leader in the consumer electronics market, driven by continuous innovation and strong market demand. Despite some challenges such as a slowdown in iPhone sales and competition from Chinese brands, the introduction of AI-powered features like Apple Intelligence is expected to boost future growth. Additionally, the company's shift towards service-based revenue streams and positive views from analysts suggest a positive outlook. However, there are concerns related to economic challenges and geopolitical factors such as tariffs, which may introduce volatility.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction, which is generally positive for the market. However, it does not provide specific insights or direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given the neutral nature of the news and the mixed predictions from previous rounds, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. The overall sentiment does not indicate a strong directional movement for AAPL's stock price.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The emergence of DeepSeek AI in China, claiming lower development costs, poses a competitive threat to US tech companies like Apple, potentially impacting their AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised could lead to regulatory scrutiny and data flow restrictions, indirectly affecting Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment overall. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings and positive outlook driven by AI chip demand.  This is positive for Apple indirectly, as Apple is a major customer of TSMC, which relies on ASML's equipment.  The positive sentiment surrounding ASML's success in the face of concerns about cheaper AI models suggests continued strong demand for high-end chips. While the impact on AAPL is indirect, it's likely to be positive.  However, the effect is not direct and may be muted compared to the impact on ASML itself.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions, and the indirect nature of the news' impact on Apple, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a low probability of a fall. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in predicting stock price movements based on indirect news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news highlights a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones, providing an alternative to Apple's existing Globalstar-based satellite service. This collaboration is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product offerings and expands its market reach, especially in areas with limited cellular coverage. The involvement of high-profile companies like SpaceX and T-Mobile, along with Elon Musk's endorsement, adds credibility and potential for future upgrades (e.g., video support). However, the immediate impact may be tempered by the service being in beta and limited to the US. The significant drop in Globalstar's shares suggests competitive pressure, but Apple's diversified business model and strong brand may mitigate any negative impact. Overall, the news is more likely to be seen as a positive development for Apple.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple, and how they are viewed as safe assets by investors.

Given the information, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The financial news highlights Apple Inc.'s strong presence in the consumer electronics market, driven by continuous innovation and high market demand. The company's introduction of AI-powered features, such as Apple Intelligence, is expected to boost future growth. Although there are challenges like competition from Chinese brands and economic uncertainties, the overall positive outlook from various analysts and the strategic partnerships support a bullish sentiment. The news also mentions the positive impact of tariffs on a strong dollar, suggesting enhanced competitiveness. The majority of previous predictions indicate a higher probability of stock price rising, though with varying degrees of certainty.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction, which is generally positive for the market. However, it does not provide specific insights or direct implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL).

The emergence of DeepSeek AI in China, claiming lower development costs, poses a competitive threat to US tech companies like Apple, potentially impacting their AI investments and market share. The national security concerns raised could lead to regulatory scrutiny and data flow restrictions, indirectly affecting Apple's operations in China. However, the news also suggests potential benefits from increased innovation and competition. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment overall. The models are split, with some leaning positive due to indirect benefits from the semiconductor industry and others negative due to competition. Given the direct competitive threat and the geopolitical concerns, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling, but not drastically so, as Apple is a large, diversified company.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news focuses on ASML's strong earnings, driven by increased AI chip demand.  This is indirectly positive for Apple, as ASML's equipment is crucial for TSMC, a major Apple chip supplier.  While the news is not directly about Apple, the positive sentiment surrounding ASML's success and the CEO's dismissal of concerns about cheaper AI models suggest continued strong demand for high-end chips, benefiting Apple indirectly.  However, the impact is indirect and less significant than the direct impact on ASML.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting uncertainty. Considering the indirect positive impact and the mixed previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a low probability of a fall. The fact that the news is about ASML and not directly about Apple tempers the positive impact.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news highlights a strategic partnership between Apple, SpaceX, and T-Mobile to integrate Starlink satellite network support into iPhones.
