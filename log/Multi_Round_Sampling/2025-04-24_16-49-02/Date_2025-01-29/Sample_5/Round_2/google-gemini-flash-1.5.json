(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\nNews Content: Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\n\nChip stocks lift Nasdaq futures ahead of Fed rate decision\n\nSemicaps stocks rise following strong ASML earnings\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform suggests a negative outlook for Apple, particularly due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically lead to a bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of an earnings report where expectations may already be high. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is indirectly positive for Apple (AAPL). ASML's strong earnings and positive outlook, driven by AI chip demand, suggest continued demand for chips used in Apple products. While DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model initially caused concern, ASML's CEO dismissed these concerns, stating that lower AI costs could lead to more applications and increased chip demand overall. This positive sentiment from a key supplier like ASML, combined with the overall growth in the AI sector, suggests a favorable environment for companies like Apple that rely on advanced chips. However, the impact is indirect, and other factors influence Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a rise is moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the broader market, particularly its potential to shift investment away from the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech companies, including Apple.  While DeepSeek's success challenges the narrative of massive AI investment being necessary, the article doesn't directly impact Apple's fundamentals or prospects. The main point is that the shift in investor sentiment towards European stocks, as suggested by Citi, is a macro trend and not directly related to Apple's performance.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect.  Any price movement would be more likely due to broader market fluctuations than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product offerings and could drive future sales. There is no negative news directly impacting Apple in the provided content. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven', a group of large tech companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance in the market is similar to a 'snake eating its own tail'. This metaphor suggests a self-referential and potentially unsustainable dynamic where these companies, viewed as safe assets, invest heavily in themselves and each other, leading to low expected returns. This analysis implies a neutral to negative outlook for these companies in the short term, as their current investment strategies may not yield high returns. Given this context, the news might have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, as it suggests that the factors contributing to its current dominance may lead to lower future returns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports that ASML, a key supplier of semiconductor equipment to companies like Apple, has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided a positive outlook for 2025. The CEO of ASML has also dismissed concerns that a new AI model from DeepSeek would hurt demand for AI chips, instead suggesting that it could lead to more applications and higher demand for chips. This positive news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price of Apple, as it is a major customer of ASML's equipment and a leader in the tech industry. The fact that ASML's stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the earnings report also suggests that the market is reacting positively to the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential impact of the emergence of DeepSeek on European stocks and the broader AI industry. It suggests a shift in focus towards European equities and away from mega-cap tech companies like Apple. While Apple is mentioned as part of the context regarding DeepSeek's popularity on their App Store, the overall sentiment is not directly related to Apple's performance. Therefore, the news does not provide clear positive or negative signals specific to Apple's stock price movement.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform indicates a negative outlook for Apple, particularly due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. This is likely to create bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of the earnings report where expectations may already be high. While some previous predictions suggested a more positive outlook based on indirect factors, the direct impact of the downgrade and the concerns raised are significant enough to warrant a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.75, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.25, Reasoning: The news is primarily positive for Apple. ASML's strong earnings, driven by AI chip demand, and the CEO's dismissal of concerns about DeepSeek's impact suggest continued demand for chips used in Apple products. ASML is a key supplier to TSMC, which in turn supplies chips to Apple. The positive sentiment surrounding ASML's performance and outlook indirectly benefits Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the most recent ones lean towards a positive impact. Given the positive news and the general trend of previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the broader market, particularly its potential to shift investment away from the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech companies, including Apple.  The article's central theme is the potential for increased European stock performance relative to US mega-cap tech, not a direct assessment of Apple's prospects. While Apple is mentioned (DeepSeek's App Store ranking), the news lacks direct implications for Apple's fundamentals or near-term performance.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the indirect nature of the news. Some models highlight positive indirect effects (ASML's success), while others emphasize the potential negative shift in investor sentiment away from mega-cap tech. Considering the lack of direct impact and the divergence in previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The probability of a price rise or fall is therefore assigned a relatively equal weight, with a slight lean towards a neutral outcome (no significant change).\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX, integrating Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update. This development is likely viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product ecosystem and could drive future sales. While there are no direct negative impacts mentioned for Apple in the news, the previous predictions show mixed sentiment. Some models (e.g., deepseek/deepseek-chart-v3-0324, meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) suggest a high probability of the stock price rising due such positive developments, whereas others (e.g., openai/gpt-4-o-mini) point towards negative sentiment, likely due other external factors. Given that the news itself is positive and there are no immediate red flags in the provided content, a moderate probability of a stock price rise can be inferred.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news headline discusses the 'Magnificent Seven', a group of large tech companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and compares their market dominance to a 'snake eating its own tail'. This metaphor suggests a self-referential and potentially unsustainable dynamic where these companies, viewed as safe assets, invest heavily in themselves and each other, leading to low expected returns. However, the news does not provide direct negative information about Apple's fundamentals or specific challenges. The previous predictions from various models show mixed sentiments, ranging from 0.25 to 0.7 for the probability of the stock price rising, and 0.1 to 0.75 for the probability of the stock price falling. Given this context, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of it falling, considering the indirect nature of the news and the mixed previous predictions.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news about ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook, driven by AI chip demand, suggests a favorable environment for companies like Apple that rely on advanced chips. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model and stating that it could lead to more applications and higher chip demand also supports a positive outlook. Considering the indirect positive impact on Apple and the overall growth in the AI sector, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling. However, the impact is indirect, and other factors influence Apple's stock price, so the probabilities are not extreme.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news primarily discusses the potential impact of the emergence of DeepSeek on European stocks and the broader AI industry. It suggests a shift in focus towards European equities and away from mega-cap tech companies like Apple. While Apple is mentioned as part of the context regarding DeepSeek's popularity on their App Store, the overall sentiment is not directly related to Apple's performance. Therefore, the news does not provide clear positive or negative signals specific to Apple's stock price movement. Additionally, the predictions from previous models show mixed sentiments, but the majority lean towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
