A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer from Outperform to Perform suggests a negative outlook for Apple, particularly due to increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Such downgrades typically lead to a bearish sentiment among investors, especially ahead of an earnings report where expectations may already be high. Given these factors, it is reasonable to estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news is indirectly positive for Apple (AAPL). ASML's strong earnings and positive outlook, driven by AI chip demand, suggest continued demand for chips used in Apple products. While DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model initially caused concern, ASML's CEO dismissed these concerns, stating that lower AI costs could lead to more applications and increased chip demand overall. This positive sentiment from a key supplier like ASML, combined with the overall growth in the AI sector, suggests a favorable environment for companies like Apple that rely on advanced chips. However, the impact is indirect, and other factors influence Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a rise is moderate.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news focuses on the impact of DeepSeek's AI model on the broader market, particularly its potential to shift investment away from the 'Magnificent Seven' mega-cap tech companies, including Apple.  While DeepSeek's success challenges the narrative of massive AI investment being necessary, the article doesn't directly impact Apple's fundamentals or prospects. The main point is that the shift in investor sentiment towards European stocks, as suggested by Citi, is a macro trend and not directly related to Apple's performance.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect.  Any price movement would be more likely due to broader market fluctuations than this specific news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.1, Reasoning: The news highlights Apple's collaboration with T-Mobile and SpaceX to integrate Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update. This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it enhances Apple's product offerings and could drive future sales. There is no negative news directly impacting Apple in the provided content. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven', a group of large tech companies including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance in the market is similar to a 'snake eating its own tail'. This metaphor suggests a self-referential and potentially unsustainable dynamic where these companies, viewed as safe assets, invest heavily in themselves and each other, leading to low expected returns. This analysis implies a neutral to negative outlook for these companies in the short term, as their current investment strategies may not yield high returns. Given this context, the news might have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, as it suggests that the factors contributing to its current dominance may lead to lower future returns.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news article reports that ASML, a key supplier of semiconductor equipment to companies like Apple, has posted better-than-expected earnings and provided a positive outlook for 2025. The CEO of ASML has also dismissed concerns that a new AI model from DeepSeek would hurt demand for AI chips, instead suggesting that it could lead to more applications and higher demand for chips. This positive news is likely to have a positive impact on the stock price of Apple, as it is a major customer of ASML's equipment and a leader in the tech industry. The fact that ASML's stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the earnings report also suggests that the market is reacting positively to the news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the potential impact of the emergence of DeepSeek on European stocks and the broader AI industry. It suggests a shift in focus towards European equities and away from mega-cap tech companies like Apple. While Apple is mentioned as part of the context regarding DeepSeek's popularity on their App Store, the overall sentiment is not directly related to Apple's performance. Therefore, the news does not provide clear positive or negative signals specific to Apple's stock price movement.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
