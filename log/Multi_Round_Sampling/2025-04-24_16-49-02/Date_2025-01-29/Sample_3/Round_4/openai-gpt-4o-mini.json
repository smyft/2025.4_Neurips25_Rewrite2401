(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings: Tesla, Microsoft &amp; Meta in Focus\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have soared on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close today. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFourth-quarter earnings of the Mag 7 companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits of the Mag 7 are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\r\n\r\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the past three months.\n\nTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nTesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Musk's proximity to Trump's administration during its second term. Trump's administration could help expedite regulatory approval for new versions of Tesla's self-driving software and for its autonomous \"robotaxis\" to hit the road.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit when the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump recently rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on TSLA shares. Tesla shares fell 5% in a month. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3. This software maker has witnessed a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Microsoft\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 4.91%, on average, in the last four quarters. The company is expected to post substantial earnings growth of 6.5% and revenue growth of 10.8% in the to-be-reported quarter. Microsoft has gained about 3.5% over the past three months.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, courtesy of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and its investments in data centers and Copilot AI applications. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\n\nIn the latest development, Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on constructing data centers designed for artificial intelligence workloads. Over half of this spending will be focused on the United States, according to a blog post by Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president.\r\n\r\nThough Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the coming quarters. Microsoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 14% over the past three months.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from $680 to $700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to $710 from $660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has gained about 4% over the past three months.\n\nApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has gained 12% in the last three months.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

Quote\n\nAmazon recently soared to new all-time highs, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show modest growth, with an expected 8.3% increase in earnings and 3.7% in revenues. However, the company has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating weaker sentiment compared to its peers in the 'Magnificent 7'. Additionally, the recent downgrade by Jefferies and weak sales guidance contribute to a bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Several downgrades due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China and due to lack of compelling AI features, are significant negatives. Independent research confirms a substantial drop in iPhone sales in China. However, the stock has recently experienced a two-day rally, suggesting some positive sentiment, possibly related to the emergence of China's AI startup DeepSeek. The overall negative sentiment from the downgrades and sales data likely outweighs the recent rally, especially with earnings being released soon. Investors are likely to be cautious given the negative press.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy.  It does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors and not this particular news item.  We assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with the general market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that are heavily invested in AI development. While the emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI solution could pose competitive risks, the immediate impact on Apple's stock is likely muted since Apple's core business is not solely dependent on AI. However, heightened geopolitical tensions and security concerns could create uncertainty in the tech sector, possibly leading to cautious investor sentiment. Overall, the news is more likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news content suggests a mixed outlook for tech stocks, with some positive and negative factors at play. On the one hand, several major tech companies, including Apple, are set to report their quarterly earnings. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have been a significant driver of its stock price. Given that ASML reported solid demand for its advanced tools, which could indicate a positive outlook for tech companies reliant on semiconductor equipment and technology, this could potentially boost investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple. On the other hand, the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek has raised concerns about the impact on Big Tech spending on AI and potential market saturation. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is expected to remain unchanged, which could influence market sentiment depending on the Fed's forward guidance. With these factors in mind, the market seems to be cautiously optimistic about Apple's earnings report and the overall tech sector performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a significant investment by Apple Inc. that is driving growth and increasing earnings per share (EPS), which is a key metric for investors. The fact that this investment is non-tech based and not related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) suggests that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams and exploring new avenues for growth. This diversification can reduce dependence on a single sector and potentially lead to more stable long-term growth. Given that the EPS has already soared, it's likely that investors will view this news positively, leading to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive earnings reports and projections from ASML, a key supplier to major tech companies including Apple. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about AI model cost-effectiveness is likely to boost investor confidence in the broader semiconductor sector, which includes Apple. While geopolitical concerns related to export controls may introduce some volatility, the overall sentiment is positive.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it prepares for its upcoming earnings report. While the overall earnings growth for the 'Magnificent 7' companies is projected to be strong, Apple's specific metrics show a modest expected increase in earnings and revenues, along with a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Additionally, recent downgrades and weak sales guidance contribute to a bearish sentiment. Although there are some positive factors, such as historical earnings surprises, the prevailing sentiment appears cautious due to the lack of compelling growth indicators. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Apple has received multiple downgrades due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Independent research confirms a significant drop in iPhone sales in China. While the stock experienced a recent two-day rally, this seems insufficient to offset the negative sentiment from the downgrades and sales data, especially with earnings being released soon. The previous rounds of predictions show a trend of increasing bearishness, further supporting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the consistent negative signals and the upcoming earnings report, investors are likely to be cautious, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news article is generic and discusses sector ETFs, offering no specific information about Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance, particularly concerning upcoming earnings and the competitive landscape (especially regarding AI).  Some models highlight positive factors like ASML's strong performance, while others emphasize negative factors such as weak iPhone sales in China and the emergence of DeepSeek.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the news and the conflicting predictions, I will base my prediction on the average sentiment from the previous round, leaning slightly towards a neutral stance, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that are heavily invested in AI development. While the emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI solution could pose competitive risks, the immediate impact on Apple's stock is likely muted since Apple's core business is not solely dependent on AI. However, heightened geopolitical tensions and security concerns could create uncertainty in the tech sector, possibly leading to cautious investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also indicate a mixed outlook, with some leaning towards a negative impact due to broader market concerns. Overall, the news is more likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with several factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, ASML reported solid demand for its advanced tools, which could indicate a positive outlook for tech companies reliant on semiconductor equipment and technology, potentially boosting investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple. Additionally, Apple's upcoming earnings report could be a driver of its stock price, historically a significant factor. However, concerns about the impact of China's DeepSeek AI model on Big Tech spending on AI and potential market saturation could weigh on investor sentiment.

This suggests that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams and exploring new avenues for growth, which can reduce dependence on a single sector and potentially lead to more stable long-term growth. Given that the EPS has already soared, it's likely that investors will view this news positively. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism about the stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering the positive impact of the investment on EPS and the trend of increasing optimism, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly affects Apple as ASML supplies equipment to companies like TSMC that manufacture chips for Apple. However, the news does not directly mention Apple or any specific news relevant to Apple's stock price movement. The previous predictions indicate a mixed sentiment but lean towards a neutral to slightly bearish outlook due to various factors. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the current market conditions, the impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Given the consistent negative signals and the upcoming earnings report, investors are likely to be cautious, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decrease. The fact that this is the fifth downgrade this month is a significant indicator of negative sentiment. The two-day rally is likely a temporary correction and doesn't negate the underlying concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article is generic and doesn't contain any information specific to Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance.  Several models highlight negative factors such as weak iPhone sales in China, concerns about AI competitiveness (DeepSeek), and a negative Earnings ESP.  Conversely, some models point to positive factors like ASML's strong performance and the potential for Apple's earnings report to drive the stock price.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the news and the conflicting predictions, I'll base my prediction on the average sentiment from the previous round, weighted slightly towards the bearish sentiment due to the consistent negative factors mentioned across multiple models. The trend shows a slight increase in bearishness over the rounds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc.

This is the fifth downgrade this month, indicating a strong negative sentiment from analysts. Independent research confirms a significant drop in iPhone sales in China. While the stock had a recent two-day rally, it's unlikely to offset the negative sentiment, especially with earnings being released soon. The previous rounds of predictions show a clear trend of increasing bearishness. Considering all these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news about investing in sector ETFs is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The analysis should focus on the previous predictions and their reasoning.  There's a clear trend of bearish sentiment across multiple models, primarily due to concerns about weakening iPhone sales (especially in China), lackluster AI features, and several recent downgrades. While some models point to potential positives (ASML's performance, Apple's historical earnings surprises, and a non-tech investment driving EPS growth), the weight of negative factors seems to dominate. The consistent bearish trend across rounds strengthens the negative outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc.

However, the direct impact of the investment on EPS and the overall positive sentiment from some models lead to a conclusion that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly affects Apple as ASML supplies equipment to companies like TSMC that manufacture chips for Apple. However, the news does not directly mention Apple or any specific news relevant to Apple's stock price movement. The previous predictions indicate a mixed sentiment but lean towards a neutral to slightly bearish outlook due to various factors. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the current market conditions, the impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
