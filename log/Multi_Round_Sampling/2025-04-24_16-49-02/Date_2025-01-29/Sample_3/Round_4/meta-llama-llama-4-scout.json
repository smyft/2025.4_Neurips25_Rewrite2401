      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\nNews Content: Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show modest growth, with an expected 8.3% increase in earnings and 3.7% in revenues. However, the company has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating weaker sentiment compared to its peers in the 'Magnificent 7'. Additionally, the recent downgrade by Jefferies and weak sales guidance contribute to a bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Several downgrades due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China and due to lack of compelling AI features, are significant negatives. Independent research confirms a substantial drop in iPhone sales in China. However, the stock has recently experienced a two-day rally, suggesting some positive sentiment, possibly related to the emergence of China's AI startup DeepSeek. The overall negative sentiment from the downgrades and sales data likely outweighs the recent rally, especially with earnings being released soon. Investors are likely to be cautious given the negative press.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy.  It does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors and not this particular news item.  We assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with the general market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that are heavily invested in AI development. While the emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI solution could pose competitive risks, the immediate impact on Apple's stock is likely muted since Apple's core business is not solely dependent on AI. However, heightened geopolitical tensions and security concerns could create uncertainty in the tech sector, possibly leading to cautious investor sentiment. Overall, the news is more likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news content suggests a mixed outlook for tech stocks, with some positive and negative factors at play. On the one hand, several major tech companies, including Apple, are set to report their quarterly earnings. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have been a significant driver of its stock price. Given that ASML reported solid demand for its advanced tools, which could indicate a positive outlook for tech companies reliant on semiconductor equipment and technology, this could potentially boost investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple. On the other hand, the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek has raised concerns about the impact on Big Tech spending on AI and potential market saturation. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is expected to remain unchanged, which could influence market sentiment depending on the Fed's forward guidance. With these factors in mind, the market seems to be cautiously optimistic about Apple's earnings report and the overall tech sector performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a significant investment by Apple Inc. that is driving growth and increasing earnings per share (EPS), which is a key metric for investors. The fact that this investment is non-tech based and not related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) suggests that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams and exploring new avenues for growth. This diversification can reduce dependence on a single sector and potentially lead to more stable long-term growth. Given that the EPS has already soared, it's likely that investors will view this news positively, leading to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive earnings reports and projections from ASML, a key supplier to major tech companies including Apple. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about AI model cost-effectiveness is likely to boost investor confidence in the broader semiconductor sector, which includes Apple. While geopolitical concerns related to export controls may introduce some volatility, the overall sentiment is positive.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it prepares for its upcoming earnings report. While the overall earnings growth for the 'Magnificent 7' companies is projected to be strong, Apple's specific metrics show a modest expected increase in earnings and revenues, along with a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Additionally, recent downgrades and weak sales guidance contribute to a bearish sentiment. Although there are some positive factors, such as historical earnings surprises, the prevailing sentiment appears cautious due to the lack of compelling growth indicators. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Apple has received multiple downgrades due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Independent research confirms a significant drop in iPhone sales in China. While the stock experienced a recent two-day rally, this seems insufficient to offset the negative sentiment from the downgrades and sales data, especially with earnings being released soon. The previous rounds of predictions show a trend of increasing bearishness, further supporting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the consistent negative signals and the upcoming earnings report, investors are likely to be cautious, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news article is generic and discusses sector ETFs, offering no specific information about Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance, particularly concerning upcoming earnings and the competitive landscape (especially regarding AI).  Some models highlight positive factors like ASML's strong performance, while others emphasize negative factors such as weak iPhone sales in China and the emergence of DeepSeek.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the news and the conflicting predictions, I will base my prediction on the average sentiment from the previous round, leaning slightly towards a neutral stance, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that are heavily invested in AI development. While the emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI solution could pose competitive risks, the immediate impact on Apple's stock is likely muted since Apple's core business is not solely dependent on AI. However, heightened geopolitical tensions and security concerns could create uncertainty in the tech sector, possibly leading to cautious investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also indicate a mixed outlook, with some leaning towards a negative impact due to broader market concerns. Overall, the news is more likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with several factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, ASML reported solid demand for its advanced tools, which could indicate a positive outlook for tech companies reliant on semiconductor equipment and technology, potentially boosting investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple. Additionally, Apple's upcoming earnings report could be a driver of its stock price, historically a significant factor. However, concerns about the impact of China's DeepSeek AI model on Big Tech spending on AI and potential market saturation could weigh on investor sentiment.

This suggests that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams and exploring new avenues for growth, which can reduce dependence on a single sector and potentially lead to more stable long-term growth. Given that the EPS has already soared, it's likely that investors will view this news positively. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism about the stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering the positive impact of the investment on EPS and the trend of increasing optimism, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly affects Apple as ASML supplies equipment to companies like TSMC that manufacture chips for Apple. However, the news does not directly mention Apple or any specific news relevant to Apple's stock price movement. The previous predictions indicate a mixed sentiment but lean towards a neutral to slightly bearish outlook due to various factors. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the current market conditions, the impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it approaches its upcoming earnings report.

Given the consistent negative signals and the upcoming earnings report, investors are likely to be cautious, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decrease. The fact that this is the fifth downgrade this month is a significant indicator of negative sentiment. The two-day rally is likely a temporary correction and doesn't negate the underlying concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article is generic and doesn't contain any information specific to Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance.  Several models highlight negative factors such as weak iPhone sales in China, concerns about AI competitiveness (DeepSeek), and a negative Earnings ESP.  Conversely, some models point to positive factors like ASML's strong performance and the potential for Apple's earnings report to drive the stock price.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the news and the conflicting predictions, I'll base my prediction on the average sentiment from the previous round, weighted slightly towards the bearish sentiment due to the consistent negative factors mentioned across multiple models. The trend shows a slight increase in bearishness over the rounds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc.

Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative, with Apple receiving another downgrade due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of compelling AI features. This is the fifth downgrade this month, indicating a strong negative sentiment from analysts. Independent research confirms a significant drop in iPhone sales in China. While the stock had a recent two-day rally, it's unlikely to offset the negative sentiment, especially with earnings being released soon. The previous rounds of predictions show a clear trend of increasing bearishness. Considering all these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news about investing in sector ETFs is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The analysis should focus on the previous predictions and their reasoning.  There's a clear trend of bearish sentiment across multiple models, primarily due to concerns about weakening iPhone sales (especially in China), lackluster AI features, and several recent downgrades. While some models point to potential positives (ASML's performance, Apple's historical earnings surprises, and a non-tech investment driving EPS growth), the weight of negative factors seems to dominate. The consistent bearish trend across rounds strengthens the negative outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc.
