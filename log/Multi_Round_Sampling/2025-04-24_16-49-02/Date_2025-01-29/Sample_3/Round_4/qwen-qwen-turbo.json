(AAPL)\nNews Headline: ASML stock rises after earnings beat as CEO says DeepSeek will drive AI chip demand higher\nNews Content: ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on January 29, 2025.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: Apple's upcoming earnings report is anticipated to show modest growth, with an expected 8.3% increase in earnings and 3.7% in revenues. However, the company has a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell), indicating weaker sentiment compared to its peers in the 'Magnificent 7'. Additionally, the recent downgrade by Jefferies and weak sales guidance contribute to a bearish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. Several downgrades due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China and due to lack of compelling AI features, are significant negatives. Independent research confirms a substantial drop in iPhone sales in China. However, the stock has recently experienced a two-day rally, suggesting some positive sentiment, possibly related to the emergence of China's AI startup DeepSeek. The overall negative sentiment from the downgrades and sales data likely outweighs the recent rally, especially with earnings being released soon. Investors are likely to be cautious given the negative press.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy.  It does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors and not this particular news item.  We assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with the general market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that are heavily invested in AI development. While the emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI solution could pose competitive risks, the immediate impact on Apple's stock is likely muted since Apple's core business is not solely dependent on AI. However, heightened geopolitical tensions and security concerns could create uncertainty in the tech sector, possibly leading to cautious investor sentiment. Overall, the news is more likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news content suggests a mixed outlook for tech stocks, with some positive and negative factors at play. On the one hand, several major tech companies, including Apple, are set to report their quarterly earnings. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have been a significant driver of its stock price. Given that ASML reported solid demand for its advanced tools, which could indicate a positive outlook for tech companies reliant on semiconductor equipment and technology, this could potentially boost investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple. On the other hand, the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek has raised concerns about the impact on Big Tech spending on AI and potential market saturation. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is expected to remain unchanged, which could influence market sentiment depending on the Fed's forward guidance. With these factors in mind, the market seems to be cautiously optimistic about Apple's earnings report and the overall tech sector performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a significant investment by Apple Inc. that is driving growth and increasing earnings per share (EPS), which is a key metric for investors. The fact that this investment is non-tech based and not related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) suggests that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams and exploring new avenues for growth. This diversification can reduce dependence on a single sector and potentially lead to more stable long-term growth. Given that the EPS has already soared, it's likely that investors will view this news positively, leading to an increase in the stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights positive earnings reports and projections from ASML, a key supplier to major tech companies including Apple. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about AI model cost-effectiveness is likely to boost investor confidence in the broader semiconductor sector, which includes Apple. While geopolitical concerns related to export controls may introduce some volatility, the overall sentiment is positive.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news highlights a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it prepares for its upcoming earnings report. While the overall earnings growth for the 'Magnificent 7' companies is projected to be strong, Apple's specific metrics show a modest expected increase in earnings and revenues, along with a negative Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell). Additionally, recent downgrades and weak sales guidance contribute to a bearish sentiment. Although there are some positive factors, such as historical earnings surprises, the prevailing sentiment appears cautious due to the lack of compelling growth indicators. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news is predominantly negative. Apple has received multiple downgrades due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. Independent research confirms a significant drop in iPhone sales in China. While the stock experienced a recent two-day rally, this seems insufficient to offset the negative sentiment from the downgrades and sales data, especially with earnings being released soon. The previous rounds of predictions show a trend of increasing bearishness, further supporting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the consistent negative signals and the upcoming earnings report, investors are likely to be cautious, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decrease.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.48, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.52, Reasoning: The provided news article is generic and discusses sector ETFs, offering no specific information about Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance, particularly concerning upcoming earnings and the competitive landscape (especially regarding AI).  Some models highlight positive factors like ASML's strong performance, while others emphasize negative factors such as weak iPhone sales in China and the emergence of DeepSeek.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the news and the conflicting predictions, I will base my prediction on the average sentiment from the previous round, leaning slightly towards a neutral stance, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that are heavily invested in AI development. While the emergence of a cost-effective Chinese AI solution could pose competitive risks, the immediate impact on Apple's stock is likely muted since Apple's core business is not solely dependent on AI. However, heightened geopolitical tensions and security concerns could create uncertainty in the tech sector, possibly leading to cautious investor sentiment. Previous predictions from other models also indicate a mixed outlook, with some leaning towards a negative impact due to broader market concerns. Overall, the news is more likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) with several factors influencing the stock price. On the positive side, ASML reported solid demand for its advanced tools, which could indicate a positive outlook for tech companies reliant on semiconductor equipment and technology, potentially boosting investor confidence in tech stocks, including Apple. Additionally, Apple's upcoming earnings report could be a driver of its stock price, historically a significant factor. However, concerns about the impact of China's DeepSeek AI model on Big Tech spending on AI and potential market saturation could weigh on investor sentiment. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is expected to remain unchanged, which could influence market sentiment depending on the Fed's forward guidance. Considering these factors, the market seems to be cautiously optimistic about Apple's earnings report and the overall tech sector performance.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news headline indicates a significant non-tech-based investment by Apple Inc. that is driving growth and increasing earnings per share (EPS). This suggests that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams and exploring new avenues for growth, which can reduce dependence on a single sector and potentially lead to more stable long-term growth. Given that the EPS has already soared, it's likely that investors will view this news positively. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism about the stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising. Considering the positive impact of the investment on EPS and the trend of increasing optimism, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news primarily focuses on ASML's earnings beat and positive outlook on AI chip demand, which indirectly affects Apple as ASML supplies equipment to companies like TSMC that manufacture chips for Apple. However, the news does not directly mention Apple or any specific news relevant to Apple's stock price movement. The previous predictions indicate a mixed sentiment but lean towards a neutral to slightly bearish outlook due to various factors. Considering the indirect nature of the news and the current market conditions, the impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) as it approaches its upcoming earnings report.

While the stock experienced a recent two-day rally, this seems insufficient to offset the negative sentiment from the downgrades and sales data, especially with earnings being released soon. The previous rounds of predictions show a trend of increasing bearishness, further supporting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the consistent negative signals and the upcoming earnings report, investors are likely to be cautious, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decrease. The fact that this is the fifth downgrade this month is a significant indicator of negative sentiment. The two-day rally is likely a temporary correction and doesn't negate the underlying concerns.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The provided news article is generic and doesn't contain any information specific to Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance.  Several models highlight negative factors such as weak iPhone sales in China, concerns about AI competitiveness (DeepSeek), and a negative Earnings ESP.  Conversely, some models point to positive factors like ASML's strong performance and the potential for Apple's earnings report to drive the stock price.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the news and the conflicting predictions, I'll base my prediction on the average sentiment from the previous round, weighted slightly towards the bearish sentiment due to the consistent negative factors mentioned across multiple models. The trend shows a slight increase in bearishness over the rounds.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc.

Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news is overwhelmingly negative, with Apple receiving another downgrade due to concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of compelling AI features. This is the fifth downgrade this month, indicating a strong negative sentiment from analysts. Independent research confirms a significant drop in iPhone sales in China. While the stock had a recent two-day rally, it's unlikely to offset the negative sentiment, especially with earnings being released soon. The previous rounds of predictions show a clear trend of increasing bearishness. Considering all these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news about investing in sector ETFs is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The analysis should focus on the previous predictions and their reasoning.  There's a clear trend of bearish sentiment across multiple models, primarily due to concerns about weakening iPhone sales (especially in China), lackluster AI features, and several recent downgrades. While some models point to potential positives (ASML's performance, Apple's historical earnings surprises, and a non-tech investment driving EPS growth), the weight of negative factors seems to dominate. The consistent bearish trend across rounds strengthens the negative outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news highlights concerns about China's DeepSeek AI potentially disrupting the AI market, which could impact US tech companies like Apple Inc. (AAPL) that are heavily invested in AI development.
