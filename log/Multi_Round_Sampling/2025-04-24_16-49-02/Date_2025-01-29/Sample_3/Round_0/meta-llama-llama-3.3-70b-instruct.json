The fact that this investment is non-tech based and not related to Artificial Intelligence (AI) suggests that Apple is diversifying its revenue streams and exploring new avenues for growth. This diversification can reduce dependence on a single sector and potentially lead to more stable long-term growth. Given that the EPS has already soared, it's likely that investors will view this news positively, leading to an increase in the stock price.
