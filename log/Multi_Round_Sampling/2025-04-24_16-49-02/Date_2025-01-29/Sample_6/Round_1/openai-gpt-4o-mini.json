      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: China's DeepSeek AI is raising US security concerns. Here's why.\nNews Content: DeepSeek, China's latest AI chatbot, is causing concern among Silicon Valley investors. The company claims to have developed a Chinese chatbot at a significantly lower cost than US tech companies, raising questions about the implications for US companies investing heavily in AI development.\n\n\"I still think this is a fairly substantial engineering feat that experts have examined, and they found that these... very young Chinese engineers have done a great job at optimizing and working around constraints in a way that oftentimes we in the West don't, and we throw additional money at it and make these models very expensive,\" Cambrian.ai Co-Founder and CEO Olaf Groth tells Catalysts host Seana Smith.\n\nWhile Groth believes DeepSeek's emergence will be \"good for the market overall,\" he notes that from a geopolitical perspective, it could escalate national security concerns.\n\n\"Open source models that generate a lot of data in the United States, then spreading that much more effectively, that data going to Chinese servers will become an issue at even greater scale,\" he warns.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns suggests potential geopolitical tensions that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of competitive AI technologies may stimulate innovation, the associated national security risks could lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of US tech firms. This uncertainty may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple (AAPL) is mixed but leans positive. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via iOS 18.3 is a positive development, suggesting innovation and potential new revenue streams. This could attract investors and drive the stock price up. However, the news is presented within a broader context of other companies and market trends, which dilutes the impact on Apple specifically. Therefore, while positive, the effect might not be dramatic. The T-Mobile news is also positive, but its direct impact on Apple is limited to the partnership aspect. Considering these factors, a slight upward movement is more probable than a downward one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  Therefore, the news has virtually no direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Any correlation would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader market sentiment or investor portfolio rebalancing.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are essentially unchanged from their pre-news levels.  To estimate those probabilities, one would need to consider other factors affecting Apple's stock, such as overall market conditions, Apple's financial performance, and industry trends.  This analysis only considers the impact of the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI, particularly from Chinese company DeepSeek, which has introduced a cost-effective AI model, potentially disrupting the AI infrastructure spending of US companies like Nvidia and others. Snowflake's CEO suggests this could reset assumptions about AI development costs. While Nvidia's stock has already seen a sharp decline due to fears of overspending, Apple (AAPL) is seen as less vulnerable because its AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, on-device models rather than large frontier models. Apple's lower capex compared to other tech giants means it faces less risk from capex ROI scrutiny. Given these points, Apple's stock may be less adversely affected or could even benefit from the shifting focus in AI investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how they dominate the market. The comparison of Big Tech to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially precarious situation. The Harvard Law professor, Mihir Desai, notes that investors view Big Tech as a safe asset, which leads to low expected returns. This situation implies that the stock price of Apple Inc. might experience low returns. Given this context, the news seems to have a slightly negative implication for Apple's stock price, as it suggests that the current high valuation and dominance might not lead to significant future growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Meta. The article provides an overview of each company's expected earnings growth, revenue growth, and recent stock performance. Based on the information provided, Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of a positive earnings surprise. The company's modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues also suggests a relatively stable but not exceptional performance. Additionally, Apple's weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and the rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform contribute to a cautious outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenue, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. Given these negative expectations, the overall sentiment is bearish. However, Cramer believes that historical trends show it beneficial to hold Apple stock, which introduces a slight positive outlook.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
