(AAPL): \u2018We Have The Most Widely Anticipated Disappointment That I\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns suggests potential geopolitical tensions that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of competitive AI technologies may stimulate innovation, the associated national security risks could lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of US tech firms. This uncertainty may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple (AAPL) is mixed but leans positive. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via iOS 18.3 is a positive development, suggesting innovation and potential new revenue streams. This could attract investors and drive the stock price up. However, the news is presented within a broader context of other companies and market trends, which dilutes the impact on Apple specifically. Therefore, while positive, the effect might not be dramatic. The T-Mobile news is also positive, but its direct impact on Apple is limited to the partnership aspect. Considering these factors, a slight upward movement is more probable than a downward one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  Therefore, the news has virtually no direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Any correlation would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader market sentiment or investor portfolio rebalancing.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are essentially unchanged from their pre-news levels.  To estimate those probabilities, one would need to consider other factors affecting Apple's stock, such as overall market conditions, Apple's financial performance, and industry trends.  This analysis only considers the impact of the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI, particularly from Chinese company DeepSeek, which has introduced a cost-effective AI model, potentially disrupting the AI infrastructure spending of US companies like Nvidia and others. Snowflake's CEO suggests this could reset assumptions about AI development costs. While Nvidia's stock has already seen a sharp decline due to fears of overspending, Apple (AAPL) is seen as less vulnerable because its AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, on-device models rather than large frontier models. Apple's lower capex compared to other tech giants means it faces less risk from capex ROI scrutiny. Given these points, Apple's stock may be less adversely affected or could even benefit from the shifting focus in AI investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how they dominate the market. The comparison of Big Tech to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially precarious situation. The Harvard Law professor, Mihir Desai, notes that investors view Big Tech as a safe asset, which leads to low expected returns. This situation implies that the stock price of Apple Inc. might experience low returns. Given this context, the news seems to have a slightly negative implication for Apple's stock price, as it suggests that the current high valuation and dominance might not lead to significant future growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Meta. The article provides an overview of each company's expected earnings growth, revenue growth, and recent stock performance. Based on the information provided, Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of a positive earnings surprise. The company's modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues also suggests a relatively stable but not exceptional performance. Additionally, Apple's weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and the rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform contribute to a cautious outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenue, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. Given these negative expectations, the overall sentiment is bearish. However, Cramer believes that historical trends show it beneficial to hold Apple stock, which introduces a slight positive outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns introduces potential geopolitical risks that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. The concerns about national security and competition from lower-cost AI technologies may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation, which could weigh on investor sentiment. While some analysts see potential benefits from innovation and cost optimization in AI, the overarching theme of security concerns suggests a bearish outlook for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of bearish sentiments, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via iOS 18.3 is a positive catalyst, suggesting innovation and potential new revenue streams. However, the news is presented alongside other company updates, diluting the impact on Apple specifically. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to broader market concerns and potential geopolitical tensions. However, the Starlink integration is a concrete positive development that should provide some upward momentum. Given the mixed signals and the slightly positive news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  Therefore, there is virtually no direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news.  Any influence would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader market sentiment or investor portfolio rebalancing.  The previous predictions regarding Apple show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding its future performance.  Factors such as overall market conditions, Apple's financial performance, and industry trends (including AI advancements) are far more significant in determining Apple's stock price movement than the news about Reddit. Given the lack of direct relevance, I'm assigning probabilities similar to a neutral baseline, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in the absence of Apple-specific news.  The previous predictions provide a context of uncertainty, and I'm not adjusting significantly from a neutral stance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, on the tech sector, particularly highlighting concerns about overspending by US companies on AI infrastructure. Nvidia's significant stock drop is noted, but Apple is seen as less vulnerable due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models and lower capital expenditures. Analysts suggest Apple could benefit from the shifting focus in AI investment, as its risk profile is lower compared to other tech giants. Given these points, while there is some uncertainty in the market, Apple's stock may be more resilient or even positively impacted by these developments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Meta. Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of a positive earnings surprise. The company's modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues also suggests a relatively stable but not exceptional performance. Additionally, Apple's weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and the rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform contribute to a cautious outlook. Considering these factors and the overall trend of others' predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple Inc., as highlighted by Jim Cramer. The news mentions factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenue, and poor Vision Pro sales, which suggest a potentially disappointing earnings report. Although Cramer acknowledges the strong management and product quality at Apple, advising investors to hold onto the stock, the overall sentiment is still bearish. The combination of these negative factors outweighs any historical benefits of holding Apple stock, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
