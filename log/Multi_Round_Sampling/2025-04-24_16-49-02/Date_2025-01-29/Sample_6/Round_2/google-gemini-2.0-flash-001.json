A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns suggests potential geopolitical tensions that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of competitive AI technologies may stimulate innovation, the associated national security risks could lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of US tech firms. This uncertainty may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple (AAPL) is mixed but leans positive. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via iOS 18.3 is a positive development, suggesting innovation and potential new revenue streams. This could attract investors and drive the stock price up. However, the news is presented within a broader context of other companies and market trends, which dilutes the impact on Apple specifically. Therefore, while positive, the effect might not be dramatic. The T-Mobile news is also positive, but its direct impact on Apple is limited to the partnership aspect. Considering these factors, a slight upward movement is more probable than a downward one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  Therefore, the news has virtually no direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Any correlation would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader market sentiment or investor portfolio rebalancing.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are essentially unchanged from their pre-news levels.  To estimate those probabilities, one would need to consider other factors affecting Apple's stock, such as overall market conditions, Apple's financial performance, and industry trends.  This analysis only considers the impact of the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI, particularly from Chinese company DeepSeek, which has introduced a cost-effective AI model, potentially disrupting the AI infrastructure spending of US companies like Nvidia and others. Snowflake's CEO suggests this could reset assumptions about AI development costs. While Nvidia's stock has already seen a sharp decline due to fears of overspending, Apple (AAPL) is seen as less vulnerable because its AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, on-device models rather than large frontier models. Apple's lower capex compared to other tech giants means it faces less risk from capex ROI scrutiny. Given these points, Apple's stock may be less adversely affected or could even benefit from the shifting focus in AI investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how they dominate the market. The comparison of Big Tech to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially precarious situation. The Harvard Law professor, Mihir Desai, notes that investors view Big Tech as a safe asset, which leads to low expected returns. This situation implies that the stock price of Apple Inc. might experience low returns. Given this context, the news seems to have a slightly negative implication for Apple's stock price, as it suggests that the current high valuation and dominance might not lead to significant future growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Meta. The article provides an overview of each company's expected earnings growth, revenue growth, and recent stock performance. Based on the information provided, Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of a positive earnings surprise. The company's modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues also suggests a relatively stable but not exceptional performance. Additionally, Apple's weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and the rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform contribute to a cautious outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenue, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. Given these negative expectations, the overall sentiment is bearish. However, Cramer believes that historical trends show it beneficial to hold Apple stock, which introduces a slight positive outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns introduces potential geopolitical risks that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. The concerns about national security and competition from lower-cost AI technologies may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation, which could weigh on investor sentiment. While some analysts see potential benefits from innovation and cost optimization in AI, the overarching theme of security concerns suggests a bearish outlook for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of bearish sentiments, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via iOS 18.3 is a positive catalyst, suggesting innovation and potential new revenue streams. However, the news is presented alongside other company updates, diluting the impact on Apple specifically. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to broader market concerns and potential geopolitical tensions. However, the Starlink integration is a concrete positive development that should provide some upward momentum. Given the mixed signals and the slightly positive news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  Therefore, there is virtually no direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news.  Any influence would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader market sentiment or investor portfolio rebalancing.  The previous predictions regarding Apple show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding its future performance.  Factors such as overall market conditions, Apple's financial performance, and industry trends (including AI advancements) are far more significant in determining Apple's stock price movement than the news about Reddit. Given the lack of direct relevance, I'm assigning probabilities similar to a neutral baseline, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in the absence of Apple-specific news.  The previous predictions provide a context of uncertainty, and I'm not adjusting significantly from a neutral stance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, on the tech sector, particularly highlighting concerns about overspending by US companies on AI infrastructure. Nvidia's significant stock drop is noted, but Apple is seen as less vulnerable due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models and lower capital expenditures. Analysts suggest Apple could benefit from the shifting focus in AI investment, as its risk profile is lower compared to other tech giants. Given these points, while there is some uncertainty in the market, Apple's stock may be more resilient or even positively impacted by these developments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Meta.

The company's modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues also suggests a relatively stable but not exceptional performance. Additionally, Apple's weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and the rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform contribute to a cautious outlook. Considering these factors and the overall trend of others' predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple Inc., as highlighted by Jim Cramer. The news mentions factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenue, and poor Vision Pro sales, which suggest a potentially disappointing earnings report. Although Cramer acknowledges the strong management and product quality at Apple, advising investors to hold onto the stock, the overall sentiment is still bearish. The combination of these negative factors outweighs any historical benefits of holding Apple stock, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
