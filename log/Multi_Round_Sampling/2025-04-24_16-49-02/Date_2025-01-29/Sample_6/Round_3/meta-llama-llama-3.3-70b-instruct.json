(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Mag 7 Earnings: Tesla, Microsoft &amp; Meta in Focus\nNews Content: The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have soared on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close today. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFourth-quarter earnings of the Mag 7 companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits of the Mag 7 are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\r\n\r\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the past three months.\n\nTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nTesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Musk's proximity to Trump's administration during its second term. Trump's administration could help expedite regulatory approval for new versions of Tesla's self-driving software and for its autonomous \"robotaxis\" to hit the road.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit when the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump recently rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on TSLA shares. Tesla shares fell 5% in a month. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3. This software maker has witnessed a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Microsoft\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 4.91%, on average, in the last four quarters. The company is expected to post substantial earnings growth of 6.5% and revenue growth of 10.8% in the to-be-reported quarter. Microsoft has gained about 3.5% over the past three months.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, courtesy of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and its investments in data centers and Copilot AI applications. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\n\nIn the latest development, Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on constructing data centers designed for artificial intelligence workloads. Over half of this spending will be focused on the United States, according to a blog post by Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president.\r\n\r\nThough Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the coming quarters. Microsoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 14% over the past three months.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from $680 to $700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to $710 from $660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has gained about 4% over the past three months.\n\nApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has gained 12% in the last three months.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.5% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 23.6% in the past three months.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon recently soared to new all-time highs, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns suggests potential geopolitical tensions that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. While the emergence of competitive AI technologies may stimulate innovation, the associated national security risks could lead to increased scrutiny and regulation of US tech firms. This uncertainty may weigh on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of a stock price decline for Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news regarding Apple (AAPL) is mixed but leans positive. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via iOS 18.3 is a positive development, suggesting innovation and potential new revenue streams. This could attract investors and drive the stock price up. However, the news is presented within a broader context of other companies and market trends, which dilutes the impact on Apple specifically. Therefore, while positive, the effect might not be dramatic. The T-Mobile news is also positive, but its direct impact on Apple is limited to the partnership aspect. Considering these factors, a slight upward movement is more probable than a downward one.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The provided news article focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  Therefore, the news has virtually no direct impact on Apple's stock price.  Any correlation would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader market sentiment or investor portfolio rebalancing.  Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are essentially unchanged from their pre-news levels.  To estimate those probabilities, one would need to consider other factors affecting Apple's stock, such as overall market conditions, Apple's financial performance, and industry trends.  This analysis only considers the impact of the provided news.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news highlights significant developments in AI, particularly from Chinese company DeepSeek, which has introduced a cost-effective AI model, potentially disrupting the AI infrastructure spending of US companies like Nvidia and others. Snowflake's CEO suggests this could reset assumptions about AI development costs. While Nvidia's stock has already seen a sharp decline due to fears of overspending, Apple (AAPL) is seen as less vulnerable because its AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, on-device models rather than large frontier models. Apple's lower capex compared to other tech giants means it faces less risk from capex ROI scrutiny. Given these points, Apple's stock may be less adversely affected or could even benefit from the shifting focus in AI investment.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how they dominate the market. The comparison of Big Tech to a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially precarious situation. The Harvard Law professor, Mihir Desai, notes that investors view Big Tech as a safe asset, which leads to low expected returns. This situation implies that the stock price of Apple Inc. might experience low returns. Given this context, the news seems to have a slightly negative implication for Apple's stock price, as it suggests that the current high valuation and dominance might not lead to significant future growth.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.42, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.58, Reasoning: The news article discusses the upcoming earnings reports of the 'Magnificent 7' companies, including Apple, Microsoft, and Meta. The article provides an overview of each company's expected earnings growth, revenue growth, and recent stock performance. Based on the information provided, Apple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating a lower likelihood of a positive earnings surprise. The company's modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues also suggests a relatively stable but not exceptional performance. Additionally, Apple's weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter and the rare downgrade by Jefferies to underperform contribute to a cautious outlook.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenue, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. Given these negative expectations, the overall sentiment is bearish. However, Cramer believes that historical trends show it beneficial to hold Apple stock, which introduces a slight positive outlook.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns introduces potential geopolitical risks that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple. The concerns about national security and competition from lower-cost AI technologies may lead to increased scrutiny and regulation, which could weigh on investor sentiment. While some analysts see potential benefits from innovation and cost optimization in AI, the overarching theme of security concerns suggests a bearish outlook for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of bearish sentiments, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via iOS 18.3 is a positive catalyst, suggesting innovation and potential new revenue streams. However, the news is presented alongside other company updates, diluting the impact on Apple specifically. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to broader market concerns and potential geopolitical tensions. However, the Starlink integration is a concrete positive development that should provide some upward momentum. Given the mixed signals and the slightly positive news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.45, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.55, Reasoning: The provided news focuses on Reddit (RDDT), not Apple (AAPL).  Therefore, there is virtually no direct impact on Apple's stock price from this news.  Any influence would be indirect and likely minimal, stemming from broader market sentiment or investor portfolio rebalancing.  The previous predictions regarding Apple show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding its future performance.  Factors such as overall market conditions, Apple's financial performance, and industry trends (including AI advancements) are far more significant in determining Apple's stock price movement than the news about Reddit. Given the lack of direct relevance, I'm assigning probabilities similar to a neutral baseline, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in the absence of Apple-specific news.  The previous predictions provide a context of uncertainty, and I'm not adjusting significantly from a neutral stance.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news discusses the impact of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI company, on the tech sector, particularly highlighting concerns about overspending by US companies on AI infrastructure. Nvidia's significant stock drop is noted, but Apple is seen as less vulnerable due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models and lower capital expenditures. Analysts suggest Apple could benefit from the shifting focus in AI investment, as its risk profile is lower compared to other tech giants. Given these points, while there is some uncertainty in the market, Apple's stock may be more resilient or even positively impacted by these developments.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

The news mentions factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenue, and poor Vision Pro sales, which suggest a potentially disappointing earnings report. Although Cramer acknowledges the strong management and product quality at Apple, advising investors to hold onto the stock, the overall sentiment is still bearish. The combination of these negative factors outweighs any historical benefits of holding Apple stock, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news about China's DeepSeek AI raising US security concerns introduces potential geopolitical risks that could negatively impact US tech companies, including Apple.
