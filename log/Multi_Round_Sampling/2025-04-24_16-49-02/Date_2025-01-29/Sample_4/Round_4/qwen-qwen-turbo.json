(AAPL): \u2018We Have The Most Widely Anticipated Disappointment That I\u2019ve Ever Seen\u2019\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the performance of Reddit (RDDT) and its potential to attract more advertisers, which could positively impact its revenue growth. However, there is a contrasting bearish outlook from Roth Capital, which predicts a slowdown in revenue growth and user growth for Reddit. While this news is not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), the mention of AI stocks and the positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL suggests that investors may view AAPL favorably in the context of AI advancements. Given the mixed signals from the news regarding RDDT and the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for cheaper AI model development could negatively impact companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure, potentially benefiting Apple due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak specifically points out that Apple's stock could be a winner. This positive sentiment is counterbalanced by the general market uncertainty and potential for broader tech sell-offs due to concerns about AI spending. The overall impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the market's reaction to AI news is volatile, making a significant rise less probable. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%), and the Services segment is expected to perform strongly (14% YoY growth), several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's stock is already down 8% in 2025, underperforming the S&P 500.  Concerns remain about China revenue (consecutive quarters of underperformance, although a positive YoY change is forecast this time), and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The overall picture is one of cautious optimism, with significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of Apple Intelligence and the continued weakness in the Chinese market.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, and Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw significant market value erosion. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings gains in the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. On the other hand, the impact on Globalstar Inc. is negative, as evidenced by the 11% decline in its premarket shares. However, for Apple, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price due to the potential for increased competitiveness and revenue growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. The tone of the news is predominantly negative towards the company's near-term prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit's (RDDT) potential for increased advertising revenue, which indirectly affects investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL's growth driven by AI advancements suggests a favorable sentiment. However, there are mixed signals from other analysts, with some expressing concerns about broader market conditions and potential slowdowns in revenue growth for tech companies. Given the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL in the context of AI and the mixed signals from the market, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling, but with caution due to the uncertainty in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a nuanced perspective on Apple's stock. The emergence of DeepSeek and its cost-effective AI model development raises concerns about overspending on AI infrastructure, which initially caused a tech sell-off, particularly impacting Nvidia. However, Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple could be a winner in this scenario because its AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, on-device LLMs, requiring significantly less capital expenditure compared to other tech giants. This lower capex requirement makes Apple less risky in a market hyper-focused on capex ROI. Snowflake's CEO's comments highlight the potential for innovation from unexpected sources, adding to the uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to AI competition and others seeing potential for a rise due to Apple's different AI strategy. Given Nowak's specific positive outlook on Apple and the potential for investors to see Apple as a safer AI play, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but acknowledging the inherent market volatility and the mixed signals from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected year-over-year growth in EPS and Services is positive, concerns remain about China revenue and the uncertain success of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The stock is already down 8% for the year, underperforming the market.  While the anticipated positive year-over-year change in China sales is a potential positive, the overall picture suggests a cautious outlook.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall. Considering the current market sentiment, the underperformance of the stock, and the uncertainties surrounding key metrics, the probability of a price fall appears slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store.

Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified revenue streams might mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current news, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about ASML's strong earnings and its optimistic outlook for 2025, driven by AI chip demand, could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. ASML's machines are crucial for producing advanced chips used by major tech companies, including Apple. The CEO's dismissal of concerns about DeepSeek's breakthrough hurting AI chip demand and his positive remarks on growth opportunities could alleviate some investor concerns about the sustainability of AI-related spending. However, the impact on Apple's stock is somewhat indirect, as the news primarily focuses on ASML and its role in the semiconductor equipment market. Given that ASML's results and guidance were better than expected and that it serves as a supplier to major tech companies, including Apple, there's a potential positive spillover effect. Yet, the direct connection to Apple's stock price movement is not strongly established, leading to a cautious but slightly positive outlook based on the overall positive sentiment in tech related to AI advancements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. The negative impact on Globalstar Inc. is not directly relevant to Apple's stock price movement. Considering the overall positive sentiment towards this partnership and its potential benefits for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a highly anticipated and potentially disappointing earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) according to Jim Cramer. Factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, poor Vision Pro sales, and a possible reduction in forecasts are cited. Cramer advises caution and recommends holding onto the stock rather than trading it, despite acknowledging its strong management and product quality. The overall tone of the news is negative, and the multiple negative factors, combined with market uncertainty and potential broader tech sell-offs, suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Reddit's potential for increased advertising revenue, which indirectly affects investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

The trend of previous predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of a price rise, which I will take into account.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings. While there's projected growth in EPS and the Services segment, concerns remain about China revenue and the uncertain success of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness. The stock is already down 8% for the year.  While a positive year-over-year change in China sales is forecast, the overall picture suggests a cautious outlook. Previous predictions are highly varied, highlighting significant uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals, the current market sentiment, the stock's underperformance, and the uncertainties surrounding key metrics, the probability of a price fall seems slightly higher than a price rise, but neither outcome is overwhelmingly likely. The lack of overwhelmingly positive news, coupled with existing concerns, tilts the balance slightly towards a negative outcome in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store.
