(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why RDDT Is Rising for a Second Straight Day\nNews Content: Reddit (RDDT) is climbing 2% this morning after rallying nearly 8% yesterday. In a note to investors yesterday afternoon, investment bank Piper Sandler contended that a technical update by the social media firm may enable it to attract more advertisers.\n\nReddit's Update Could Be Significant\n\nThe company has made it easier for marketers to replicate on Reddit the ad campaigns that they're using on Meta (META), Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion explained. As a result, the number of firms advertising on Reddit could meaningfully increase, Champion asserted. Such a development, in turn, could cause the firm's revenue growth to accelerate, the analyst wrote.Evercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\n\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\n\nAnother Investment Bank Was Recently Bearish on RDDT\n\nIn a note to investors on Jan. 22, investment bank Roth Capital downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy. The investment bank predicted that the company's revenue growth would decelerate in upcoming quarters, and it expects RDDT's EBITA margins to drop over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Roth predicts that the company's user growth will slow this year after it added a record number of users in 2024. It placed a $195 price target on RDDT.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of RDDT\n\nIn the last month, the shares have advanced 20%, while they are up 70% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the performance of Reddit (RDDT) and its potential to attract more advertisers, which could positively impact its revenue growth. However, there is a contrasting bearish outlook from Roth Capital, which predicts a slowdown in revenue growth and user growth for Reddit. While this news is not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), the mention of AI stocks and the positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL suggests that investors may view AAPL favorably in the context of AI advancements. Given the mixed signals from the news regarding RDDT and the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for cheaper AI model development could negatively impact companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure, potentially benefiting Apple due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak specifically points out that Apple's stock could be a winner. This positive sentiment is counterbalanced by the general market uncertainty and potential for broader tech sell-offs due to concerns about AI spending. The overall impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the market's reaction to AI news is volatile, making a significant rise less probable. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%), and the Services segment is expected to perform strongly (14% YoY growth), several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's stock is already down 8% in 2025, underperforming the S&P 500.  Concerns remain about China revenue (consecutive quarters of underperformance, although a positive YoY change is forecast this time), and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The overall picture is one of cautious optimism, with significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of Apple Intelligence and the continued weakness in the Chinese market.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, and Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw significant market value erosion. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings gains in the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. On the other hand, the impact on Globalstar Inc. is negative, as evidenced by the 11% decline in its premarket shares. However, for Apple, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price due to the potential for increased competitiveness and revenue growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. The tone of the news is predominantly negative towards the company's near-term prospects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
