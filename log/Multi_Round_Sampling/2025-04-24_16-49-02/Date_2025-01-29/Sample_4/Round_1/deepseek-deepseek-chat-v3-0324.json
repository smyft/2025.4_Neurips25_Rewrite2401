(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\nNews Content: Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks?

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the performance of Reddit (RDDT) and its potential to attract more advertisers, which could positively impact its revenue growth. However, there is a contrasting bearish outlook from Roth Capital, which predicts a slowdown in revenue growth and user growth for Reddit. While this news is not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), the mention of AI stocks and the positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL suggests that investors may view AAPL favorably in the context of AI advancements. Given the mixed signals from the news regarding RDDT and the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for cheaper AI model development could negatively impact companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure, potentially benefiting Apple due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak specifically points out that Apple's stock could be a winner. This positive sentiment is counterbalanced by the general market uncertainty and potential for broader tech sell-offs due to concerns about AI spending. The overall impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the market's reaction to AI news is volatile, making a significant rise less probable. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%), and the Services segment is expected to perform strongly (14% YoY growth), several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's stock is already down 8% in 2025, underperforming the S&P 500.  Concerns remain about China revenue (consecutive quarters of underperformance, although a positive YoY change is forecast this time), and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The overall picture is one of cautious optimism, with significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of Apple Intelligence and the continued weakness in the Chinese market.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, and Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw significant market value erosion. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings gains in the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. On the other hand, the impact on Globalstar Inc. is negative, as evidenced by the 11% decline in its premarket shares. However, for Apple, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price due to the potential for increased competitiveness and revenue growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. The tone of the news is predominantly negative towards the company's near-term prospects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
