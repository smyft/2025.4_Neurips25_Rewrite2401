(AAPL)\nNews Headline: ASML stock rises after earnings beat as CEO says DeepSeek will drive AI chip demand higher\nNews Content: ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on January 29, 2025.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the performance of Reddit (RDDT) and its potential to attract more advertisers, which could positively impact its revenue growth. However, there is a contrasting bearish outlook from Roth Capital, which predicts a slowdown in revenue growth and user growth for Reddit. While this news is not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), the mention of AI stocks and the positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL suggests that investors may view AAPL favorably in the context of AI advancements. Given the mixed signals from the news regarding RDDT and the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for cheaper AI model development could negatively impact companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure, potentially benefiting Apple due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak specifically points out that Apple's stock could be a winner. This positive sentiment is counterbalanced by the general market uncertainty and potential for broader tech sell-offs due to concerns about AI spending. The overall impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the market's reaction to AI news is volatile, making a significant rise less probable. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%), and the Services segment is expected to perform strongly (14% YoY growth), several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's stock is already down 8% in 2025, underperforming the S&P 500.  Concerns remain about China revenue (consecutive quarters of underperformance, although a positive YoY change is forecast this time), and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The overall picture is one of cautious optimism, with significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of Apple Intelligence and the continued weakness in the Chinese market.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, and Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw significant market value erosion. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings gains in the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. On the other hand, the impact on Globalstar Inc. is negative, as evidenced by the 11% decline in its premarket shares. However, for Apple, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price due to the potential for increased competitiveness and revenue growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. The tone of the news is predominantly negative towards the company's near-term prospects.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
