(AAPL)\nNews Headline: What does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\nNews Content: Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks? Citi weighs in\n\nChip stocks lift Nasdaq futures ahead of Fed rate decision\n\nSemicaps stocks rise following strong ASML earnings\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the performance of Reddit (RDDT) and its potential to attract more advertisers, which could positively impact its revenue growth. However, there is a contrasting bearish outlook from Roth Capital, which predicts a slowdown in revenue growth and user growth for Reddit. While this news is not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), the mention of AI stocks and the positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL suggests that investors may view AAPL favorably in the context of AI advancements. Given the mixed signals from the news regarding RDDT and the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for cheaper AI model development could negatively impact companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure, potentially benefiting Apple due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak specifically points out that Apple's stock could be a winner. This positive sentiment is counterbalanced by the general market uncertainty and potential for broader tech sell-offs due to concerns about AI spending. The overall impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the market's reaction to AI news is volatile, making a significant rise less probable. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%), and the Services segment is expected to perform strongly (14% YoY growth), several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's stock is already down 8% in 2025, underperforming the S&P 500.  Concerns remain about China revenue (consecutive quarters of underperformance, although a positive YoY change is forecast this time), and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The overall picture is one of cautious optimism, with significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of Apple Intelligence and the continued weakness in the Chinese market.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, and Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw significant market value erosion. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings gains in the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. On the other hand, the impact on Globalstar Inc. is negative, as evidenced by the 11% decline in its premarket shares. However, for Apple, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price due to the potential for increased competitiveness and revenue growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. The tone of the news is predominantly negative towards the company's near-term prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit's (RDDT) potential for increased advertising revenue, which indirectly affects investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL's growth driven by AI advancements suggests a favorable sentiment. However, there are mixed signals from other analysts, with some expressing concerns about broader market conditions and potential slowdowns in revenue growth for tech companies. Given the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL in the context of AI and the mixed signals from the market, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling, but with caution due to the uncertainty in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a nuanced perspective on Apple's stock. The emergence of DeepSeek and its cost-effective AI model development raises concerns about overspending on AI infrastructure, which initially caused a tech sell-off, particularly impacting Nvidia. However, Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple could be a winner in this scenario because its AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, on-device LLMs, requiring significantly less capital expenditure compared to other tech giants. This lower capex requirement makes Apple less risky in a market hyper-focused on capex ROI. Snowflake's CEO's comments highlight the potential for innovation from unexpected sources, adding to the uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to AI competition and others seeing potential for a rise due to Apple's different AI strategy. Given Nowak's specific positive outlook on Apple and the potential for investors to see Apple as a safer AI play, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but acknowledging the inherent market volatility and the mixed signals from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected year-over-year growth in EPS and Services is positive, concerns remain about China revenue and the uncertain success of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The stock is already down 8% for the year, underperforming the market.  While the anticipated positive year-over-year change in China sales is a potential positive, the overall picture suggests a cautious outlook.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall. Considering the current market sentiment, the underperformance of the stock, and the uncertainties surrounding key metrics, the probability of a price fall appears slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store.

Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified revenue streams might mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current news, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about ASML's strong earnings and its optimistic outlook for 2025, driven by AI chip demand, could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. ASML's machines are crucial for producing advanced chips used by major tech companies, including Apple. The CEO's dismissal of concerns about DeepSeek's breakthrough hurting AI chip demand and his positive remarks on growth opportunities could alleviate some investor concerns about the sustainability of AI-related spending. However, the impact on Apple's stock is somewhat indirect, as the news primarily focuses on ASML and its role in the semiconductor equipment market. Given that ASML's results and guidance were better than expected and that it serves as a supplier to major tech companies, including Apple, there's a potential positive spillover effect. Yet, the direct connection to Apple's stock price movement is not strongly established, leading to a cautious but slightly positive outlook based on the overall positive sentiment in tech related to AI advancements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. The negative impact on Globalstar Inc. is not directly relevant to Apple's stock price movement. Considering the overall positive sentiment towards this partnership and its potential benefits for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a highly anticipated and potentially disappointing earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) according to Jim Cramer. Factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, poor Vision Pro sales, and a possible reduction in forecasts are cited. Cramer advises caution and recommends holding onto the stock rather than trading it, despite acknowledging its strong management and product quality. The overall tone of the news is negative, and the multiple negative factors, combined with market uncertainty and potential broader tech sell-offs, suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses Reddit's potential for increased advertising revenue, which indirectly affects investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple Inc.

The trend of previous predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of a price rise, which I will take into account.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings. While there's projected growth in EPS and the Services segment, concerns remain about China revenue and the uncertain success of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness. The stock is already down 8% for the year.  While a positive year-over-year change in China sales is forecast, the overall picture suggests a cautious outlook. Previous predictions are highly varied, highlighting significant uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals, the current market sentiment, the stock's underperformance, and the uncertainties surrounding key metrics, the probability of a price fall seems slightly higher than a price rise, but neither outcome is overwhelmingly likely. The lack of overwhelmingly positive news, coupled with existing concerns, tilts the balance slightly towards a negative outcome in the short term.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store.
