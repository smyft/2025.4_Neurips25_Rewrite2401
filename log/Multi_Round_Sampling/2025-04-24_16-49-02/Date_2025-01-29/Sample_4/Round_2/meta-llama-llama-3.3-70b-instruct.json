(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones\nNews Content: (Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThe companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news primarily discusses the performance of Reddit (RDDT) and its potential to attract more advertisers, which could positively impact its revenue growth. However, there is a contrasting bearish outlook from Roth Capital, which predicts a slowdown in revenue growth and user growth for Reddit. While this news is not directly about Apple Inc. (AAPL), the mention of AI stocks and the positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL suggests that investors may view AAPL favorably in the context of AI advancements. Given the mixed signals from the news regarding RDDT and the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the potential for cheaper AI model development could negatively impact companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure, potentially benefiting Apple due to its focus on smaller, on-device AI models. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak specifically points out that Apple's stock could be a winner. This positive sentiment is counterbalanced by the general market uncertainty and potential for broader tech sell-offs due to concerns about AI spending. The overall impact is likely to be slightly positive, but the market's reaction to AI news is volatile, making a significant rise less probable. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows modest year-over-year growth (8%), and the Services segment is expected to perform strongly (14% YoY growth), several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's stock is already down 8% in 2025, underperforming the S&P 500.  Concerns remain about China revenue (consecutive quarters of underperformance, although a positive YoY change is forecast this time), and the success of Apple Intelligence remains uncertain.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The overall picture is one of cautious optimism, with significant uncertainty surrounding the impact of Apple Intelligence and the continued weakness in the Chinese market.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the mixed signals.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, and Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw significant market value erosion. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings gains in the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.7, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.3, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. (AAPL) partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. On the other hand, the impact on Globalstar Inc. is negative, as evidenced by the 11% decline in its premarket shares. However, for Apple, this news is likely to have a positive impact on its stock price due to the potential for increased competitiveness and revenue growth.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: Jim Cramer, in his commentary, suggests that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is expected to have disappointing earnings, with factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, and poor Vision Pro sales. Despite acknowledging Apple's strong management and product quality, Cramer advises holding onto the stock rather than trading it. The tone of the news is predominantly negative towards the company's near-term prospects.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news primarily focuses on Reddit's (RDDT) potential for increased advertising revenue, which indirectly affects investor sentiment towards tech stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The positive outlook from Evercore ISI regarding AAPL's growth driven by AI advancements suggests a favorable sentiment. However, there are mixed signals from other analysts, with some expressing concerns about broader market conditions and potential slowdowns in revenue growth for tech companies. Given the overall positive sentiment towards AAPL in the context of AI and the mixed signals from the market, I estimate a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising than falling, but with caution due to the uncertainty in the market.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news presents a nuanced perspective on Apple's stock. The emergence of DeepSeek and its cost-effective AI model development raises concerns about overspending on AI infrastructure, which initially caused a tech sell-off, particularly impacting Nvidia. However, Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple could be a winner in this scenario because its AI ambitions are more contained and focused on smaller, on-device LLMs, requiring significantly less capital expenditure compared to other tech giants. This lower capex requirement makes Apple less risky in a market hyper-focused on capex ROI. Snowflake's CEO's comments highlight the potential for innovation from unexpected sources, adding to the uncertainty. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price fall due to AI competition and others seeing potential for a rise due to Apple's different AI strategy. Given Nowak's specific positive outlook on Apple and the potential for investors to see Apple as a safer AI play, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but acknowledging the inherent market volatility and the mixed signals from the news.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The Zacks report presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the projected year-over-year growth in EPS and Services is positive, concerns remain about China revenue and the uncertain success of Apple Intelligence.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  The stock is already down 8% for the year, underperforming the market.  While the anticipated positive year-over-year change in China sales is a potential positive, the overall picture suggests a cautious outlook.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a price fall. Considering the current market sentiment, the underperformance of the stock, and the uncertainties surrounding key metrics, the probability of a price fall appears slightly higher than a price rise.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news discusses the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, which has overtaken OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple's App Store. This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, and Nvidia, a key player in the AI boom, saw significant market value erosion.

This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus on US tech giants and potential concerns over AI spending efficiency. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified revenue streams might mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the current news, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news about ASML's strong earnings and its optimistic outlook for 2025, driven by AI chip demand, could have a positive impact on Apple's stock price. ASML's machines are crucial for producing advanced chips used by major tech companies, including Apple. The CEO's dismissal of concerns about DeepSeek's breakthrough hurting AI chip demand and his positive remarks on growth opportunities could alleviate some investor concerns about the sustainability of AI-related spending. However, the impact on Apple's stock is somewhat indirect, as the news primarily focuses on ASML and its role in the semiconductor equipment market. Given that ASML's results and guidance were better than expected and that it serves as a supplier to major tech companies, including Apple, there's a potential positive spillover effect. Yet, the direct connection to Apple's stock price movement is not strongly established, leading to a cautious but slightly positive outlook based on the overall positive sentiment in tech related to AI advancements.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.8, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.2, Reasoning: The news about Apple Inc. partnering with SpaceX to support the Starlink satellite network on iPhones is a positive development for the company. This partnership expands Apple's offerings in the satellite communication space, providing an alternative to its in-house service. The ability to automatically connect to the Starlink network without requiring users to point their iPhone to the sky is a significant advantage. Additionally, the potential for future expansions into data connections and voice calls could lead to increased revenue streams for Apple. The negative impact on Globalstar Inc. is not directly relevant to Apple's stock price movement. Considering the overall positive sentiment towards this partnership and its potential benefits for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights a highly anticipated and potentially disappointing earnings report for Apple Inc. (AAPL) according to Jim Cramer. Factors such as low cell phone orders, lack of AI advancements, slowing service revenues, poor Vision Pro sales, and a possible reduction in forecasts are cited. Cramer advises caution and recommends holding onto the stock rather than trading it, despite acknowledging its strong management and product quality. The overall tone of the news is negative, and the multiple negative factors, combined with market uncertainty and potential broader tech sell-offs, suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price decline.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
