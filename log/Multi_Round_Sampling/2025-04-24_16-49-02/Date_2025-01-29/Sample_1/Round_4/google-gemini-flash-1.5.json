(AAPL)?\nNews Content: We recently compiled a list of the 12 Safest Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other safe stocks.\n\nHedge funds, known for their sophisticated investment strategies and ability to generate returns across market cycles, have a complex performance history. Since their inception in 1949, hedge funds have evolved significantly, with returns varying widely by strategy, market conditions, and the broader economic environment. The first hedge fund was created by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, combining long and short equity positions to hedge against market risk. During the 1950s and 1960s, hedge funds gained attention for their ability to outperform traditional mutual funds. Jones\u2019s fund reportedly generated returns of approximately 20% annually in its early years, setting a precedent for the industry.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were challenging due to high inflation, stagflation, and the oil crisis, but some hedge funds excelled by capitalizing on macroeconomic trends. Macro-focused funds like those led by George Soros delivered impressive returns by making bold bets on currencies and commodities. For example, Soros famously earned $1 billion in 1992 by shorting the British pound. The 1990s were a golden era for hedge funds, marked by rapid industry growth and strong performance. The average annual return of hedge funds during this period was approximately 15%, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Managers benefited from a booming stock market, globalization, and the rise of new asset classes.\n\nNotable successes included Tiger Management, led by Julian Robertson, and Renaissance Technologies, whose Medallion Fund achieved annualized returns exceeding 30%. The 2000s were a mixed decade for hedge funds. The early 2000s saw strong performance during the dot-com crash, as many funds profited from short positions in overvalued tech stocks. Between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 43%, while hedge funds, on average, delivered positive annualized returns of around 6%. However, the 2008 financial crisis tested the industry. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index declined by 19% in 2008, its worst annual performance on record. However, since the 2010s, there has been a prolonged bull market, barring minor blips during the pandemic, during which hedge funds have shined relative to other investment vehicles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company offers a robust investment case for several reasons. Apple has achieved 11 consecutive years of dividend growth, exceeding the sector median of 1.7 years by 555%, reflecting its commitment to consistently increasing shareholder returns. The company is also planning to launch a new low-cost iPhone, a refreshed low-cost iPad, and an M4 MacBook Air. The iPhone SE, the company\u2019s first device with an Apple 5G modem, will see an update in 2025, and it is expected to feature a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, and an iPhone 14-like design. It will be the first Apple device with an Apple 5G modem. Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on an 11th-generation iPad with a faster chip and support for Wi-Fi 6E. The tablet is also expected to feature Apple's custom-designed modem chip, an A17 Pro chip, and 8GB RAM. Lastly, the iPad Air is going to get updated with either an M3 or M4 chip, and it could debut alongside a new lower-cost Magic Keyboard that Apple is developing for the more affordable iPad models.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the safest stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition adds to the bearish sentiment. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall trend appears negative due to the downgrades and concerns about future sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Apple is a popular stock among hedge funds, which are generally considered sophisticated investors. This suggests a positive outlook on the stock. The article also mentions Apple's consistent dividend growth and upcoming product releases, which are positive catalysts. However, the article also states that there are potentially better investment opportunities with higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article presents a mixed view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights that hedge funds are bullish on Apple (AAPL), citing its strong fundamentals, including consistent dividend growth, planned product launches (new iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air), and a high number of hedge fund holders (158).  While the article acknowledges AAPL's potential, it also suggests other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  The positive sentiment from hedge funds is a significant factor, but the article's somewhat muted overall assessment tempers the bullishness.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the overall market conditions and the article's suggestion of potentially better alternatives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of the best American stocks to buy and hold, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders). The company's focus on AI integration, particularly with the iPhone 16 launch and iOS 18, is expected to drive growth and monetization opportunities. Additionally, a bullish tech sector outlook under potential business-friendly policies from the Trump administration could benefit AAPL. However, challenges include slower iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese manufacturers and broader market risks like potential tariffs and volatility from policy uncertainties. The overall market is expected to grow moderately, with tech stocks potentially outperforming. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with notable risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the stock. Historically, downgrades tend to negatively impact stock prices. Additionally, the concerns cited about iPhone sales, such as increased competition in China and lack of compelling AI apps, are specific and potentially impactful. While the stock had a recent 7% two-day gain, it remains down 9% from its December record. Given the negative analyst sentiment and specific concerns about iPhone sales ahead of the company's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. This discrepancy suggests that the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or operations. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple Inc.'s stock price should be minimal. However, given that both companies are major players in the tech industry, any significant movement in one tech giant can have a ripple effect on others due to broader market sentiment. Since the news is positive for Meta Platforms, indicating growth and investment in emerging technologies like augmented reality and artificial intelligence, it could contribute to a positive overall sentiment in the tech sector, potentially benefiting Apple Inc. indirectly. Nonetheless, without direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are likely to be closer to a neutral stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there has been a downward revision in stock performance in 2025, with shares down roughly 8%. However, the earnings and sales estimates remain relatively stable, though growth is slowing. The focus on China results and Services segment could provide some positive insights, particularly if growth in China resumes. However, the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating suggests bearishness, and the skepticism around Apple Intelligence may impact investor sentiment negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition adds to the bearish sentiment. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall trend appears negative due to the downgrades and concerns about future sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its popularity among hedge funds, consistent dividend growth, and upcoming product releases. However, it also suggests that other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning bullish and others bearish. The fact that Apple is considered a 'safe' stock by hedge funds suggests stability, but the article's acknowledgment of potentially better opportunities tempers the bullishness. Given this mixed sentiment and the trend of previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not overwhelmingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights the bullish sentiment of hedge funds, a significant factor given their sophisticated investment strategies and the high number of hedge fund holders (158), it also suggests that other stocks might offer better returns.  The article points to positive factors like consistent dividend growth and upcoming product launches. However, the overall tone is somewhat tempered, suggesting that while Apple is a solid investment, it might not be the *best* investment opportunity available.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely from 0.3 to 0.65 probability of a price rise, and the mixed signals in the article itself, a moderate probability of a price rise seems appropriate. The previous predictions also show a lack of consensus, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term prospects.  The absence of any significantly negative news in this particular article further supports a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of the best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders).

Concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps have led to a cautious stance among analysts. Given that the stock has recently experienced a 7% two-day gain but remains down 9% from its December record, and with Apple's earnings report approaching, the downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales growth are likely to impact the stock price negatively. However, the presence of mixed signals and the stock's recent performance suggest that while there is a higher likelihood of a stock price fall, it is not overwhelmingly so, as some predictions suggest a relatively balanced view with a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. This discrepancy suggests that the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or operations. However, considering the positive sentiment in the tech sector due to Meta Platforms' growth and investment in emerging technologies, it could have a minimal indirect positive effect on Apple Inc. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed predictions from other models, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are likely to be closer to a neutral stance. Since the news is positive for the tech sector, I slightly lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the difference is minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company's earnings and sales estimates remain relatively stable despite slower growth. The focus on China results and Services segment could provide some positive insights if there's improvement in China, and the positive trends in the Services segment are encouraging. However, the recent downgrades, notably the Zacks Rank #4 Sell rating, suggest bearishness among analysts. Additionally, the skepticism around Apple Intelligence and the ongoing competitive pressure in China continue to weigh on the stock. The recent earnings report and guidance will critically influence investor sentiment, especially regarding the adoption rate of Apple Intelligence and the performance in China.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about iPhone sales, particularly in China.

Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.57, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.43, Reasoning: The article focuses on hedge fund interest in Apple, highlighting its safety and dividend growth. While it acknowledges that other stocks might offer higher returns, the fact that Apple is considered a 'safe' stock by hedge funds is a positive signal. The upcoming product releases (new iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air) are also potential catalysts. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, but most models lean slightly bullish. Given this mixed sentiment and the trend of previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not overwhelmingly. The article's acknowledgment of potentially better opportunities tempers the bullishness.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The bullish sentiment from hedge funds (158 holders) is a significant positive, suggesting confidence in Apple's long-term prospects and strong fundamentals like consistent dividend growth and planned product launches.  However, the article also tempers this optimism by suggesting that other stocks might offer higher returns in the shorter term.  This suggests that while Apple is a solid, safe investment, it may not be the most exciting or high-growth opportunity currently available.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term prospects.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of overwhelmingly negative news in this specific article, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty.  The previous predictions' range (0.3 to 0.65 for probability of rise) and the article's own muted assessment support a moderate probability of a price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
