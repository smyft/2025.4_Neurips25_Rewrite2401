(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition adds to the bearish sentiment. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall trend appears negative due to the downgrades and concerns about future sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Apple is a popular stock among hedge funds, which are generally considered sophisticated investors. This suggests a positive outlook on the stock. The article also mentions Apple's consistent dividend growth and upcoming product releases, which are positive catalysts. However, the article also states that there are potentially better investment opportunities with higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article presents a mixed view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights that hedge funds are bullish on Apple (AAPL), citing its strong fundamentals, including consistent dividend growth, planned product launches (new iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air), and a high number of hedge fund holders (158).  While the article acknowledges AAPL's potential, it also suggests other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  The positive sentiment from hedge funds is a significant factor, but the article's somewhat muted overall assessment tempers the bullishness.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the overall market conditions and the article's suggestion of potentially better alternatives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of the best American stocks to buy and hold, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders). The company's focus on AI integration, particularly with the iPhone 16 launch and iOS 18, is expected to drive growth and monetization opportunities. Additionally, a bullish tech sector outlook under potential business-friendly policies from the Trump administration could benefit AAPL. However, challenges include slower iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese manufacturers and broader market risks like potential tariffs and volatility from policy uncertainties. The overall market is expected to grow moderately, with tech stocks potentially outperforming. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with notable risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the stock. Historically, downgrades tend to negatively impact stock prices. Additionally, the concerns cited about iPhone sales, such as increased competition in China and lack of compelling AI apps, are specific and potentially impactful. While the stock had a recent 7% two-day gain, it remains down 9% from its December record. Given the negative analyst sentiment and specific concerns about iPhone sales ahead of the company's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. This discrepancy suggests that the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or operations. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple Inc.'s stock price should be minimal. However, given that both companies are major players in the tech industry, any significant movement in one tech giant can have a ripple effect on others due to broader market sentiment. Since the news is positive for Meta Platforms, indicating growth and investment in emerging technologies like augmented reality and artificial intelligence, it could contribute to a positive overall sentiment in the tech sector, potentially benefiting Apple Inc. indirectly. Nonetheless, without direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are likely to be closer to a neutral stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there has been a downward revision in stock performance in 2025, with shares down roughly 8%. However, the earnings and sales estimates remain relatively stable, though growth is slowing. The focus on China results and Services segment could provide some positive insights, particularly if growth in China resumes. However, the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating suggests bearishness, and the skepticism around Apple Intelligence may impact investor sentiment negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition adds to the bearish sentiment. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall trend appears negative due to the downgrades and concerns about future sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its popularity among hedge funds, consistent dividend growth, and upcoming product releases. However, it also suggests that other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning bullish and others bearish. The fact that Apple is considered a 'safe' stock by hedge funds suggests stability, but the article's acknowledgment of potentially better opportunities tempers the bullishness. Given this mixed sentiment and the trend of previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not overwhelmingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights the bullish sentiment of hedge funds, a significant factor given their sophisticated investment strategies and the high number of hedge fund holders (158), it also suggests that other stocks might offer better returns.  The article points to positive factors like consistent dividend growth and upcoming product launches. However, the overall tone is somewhat tempered, suggesting that while Apple is a solid investment, it might not be the *best* investment opportunity available.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely from 0.3 to 0.65 probability of a price rise, and the mixed signals in the article itself, a moderate probability of a price rise seems appropriate. The previous predictions also show a lack of consensus, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term prospects.  The absence of any significantly negative news in this particular article further supports a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of the best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders).

Concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps have led to a cautious stance among analysts. Given that the stock has recently experienced a 7% two-day gain but remains down 9% from its December record, and with Apple's earnings report approaching, the downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales growth are likely to impact the stock price negatively. However, the presence of mixed signals and the stock's recent performance suggest that while there is a higher likelihood of a stock price fall, it is not overwhelmingly so, as some predictions suggest a relatively balanced view with a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. This discrepancy suggests that the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or operations. However, considering the positive sentiment in the tech sector due to Meta Platforms' growth and investment in emerging technologies, it could have a minimal indirect positive effect on Apple Inc. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed predictions from other models, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are likely to be closer to a neutral stance. Since the news is positive for the tech sector, I slightly lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the difference is minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company's earnings and sales estimates remain relatively stable despite slower growth. The focus on China results and Services segment could provide some positive insights if there's improvement in China, and the positive trends in the Services segment are encouraging. However, the recent downgrades, notably the Zacks Rank #4 Sell rating, suggest bearishness among analysts. Additionally, the skepticism around Apple Intelligence and the ongoing competitive pressure in China continue to weigh on the stock. The recent earnings report and guidance will critically influence investor sentiment, especially regarding the adoption rate of Apple Intelligence and the performance in China.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about iPhone sales, particularly in China.

While it acknowledges that other stocks might offer higher returns, the fact that Apple is considered a 'safe' stock by hedge funds is a positive signal. The upcoming product releases (new iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air) are also potential catalysts. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, but most models lean slightly bullish. Given this mixed sentiment and the trend of previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not overwhelmingly.

The bullish sentiment from hedge funds (158 holders) is a significant positive, suggesting confidence in Apple's long-term prospects and strong fundamentals like consistent dividend growth and planned product launches.  However, the article also tempers this optimism by suggesting that other stocks might offer higher returns in the shorter term.  This suggests that while Apple is a solid, safe investment, it may not be the most exciting or high-growth opportunity currently available.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term prospects.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of overwhelmingly negative news in this specific article, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty.  The previous predictions' range (0.3 to 0.65 for probability of rise) and the article's own muted assessment support a moderate probability of a price increase.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The financial news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.
