(AAPL) the Best American Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?\nNews Content: We recently published a list of 10 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nWill the Market Continue To Be Bullish in 2025?\n\nWall Street\u2019s outlook for the stock market in 2025 reflects a cautious optimism following two consecutive years of substantial gains. Analysts predict continued growth, however at a more moderate pace compared to the explosive increases of 2023 and 2024. According to a report by CNN, published on January 1, strategists anticipate a 14.8% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, which is significant but lower than the previous years\u2019 performances. The Index saw gains of approximately 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. As per the report 2025 marks a return to typical growth rates after an extraordinary period of high returns, which has not been seen since the late 1990s.\n\nWhile several factors are expected to contribute to the market growth, there are potential risks that can hinder it. One of the key factors contributing to growth is the anticipated business-friendly policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Dan Ives, who is a technology senior analyst at Wedbush Securities in his December 30 note mentioned his expectations that tech stocks can rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration. The analyst has picked Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks as his best performers for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential risks that could negatively impact the stock market. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy decisions may create a volatile environment for markets. Traders are particularly wary of how proposed tariffs could affect economic stability and investor confidence. David Sekera from Morningstar emphasizes that the implementation of tariffs is a significant wildcard that could sway market performance in either direction. We recently covered the analysis of Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company in our article titled, 12 High Growth International Stocks to Invest in Now. Here\u2019s a piece from our coverage:\n\n\u201cWhile talking about large-cap stock performance, Timmer raises the question of whether this trend of narrow leadership will persist. He suggested that trends continue to move in the same direction until a significant change occurs. Given that large-cap growth stocks have dominated for years, it is reasonable to assume that they may continue to lead. However, he also cautioned the investors that as per the concept of mean reversion, asset prices will eventually return to their historical averages and when this happens, it could lead to sharp corrections in stock prices. Timmer believes that while 2024 was a \u201cGoldilocks year,\u201d for earnings and valuations, this year can be a tussle between higher earnings and rising long-term interest rates, thereby resulting in a volatile market.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo get the list of the 10 best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. Using the database we ranked the top 10 American stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an international provider of smartphones, personal computers, and other technology gadgets. Based in America, the company is renowned for its iPhone, Mac, and iPad. On January 27, Rosenblatt Securities reiterated their Buy rating on the stock, keeping the price target of $262. The firm expects the ongoing December quarter to be a bit low due to slower sales of the iPhone as it continues to face challenges from other Chinese manufacturers.\n\nManagement has been proactive in dealing with this competition. They released Apple Intelligence in June last year. The new artificial intelligence will be integrated with upcoming models to enhance user experience and act as a competitive edge over its competitors. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also shifted its focus on the Apple Store and its services revenue stream. As a result, the company was able to generate a record $25 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of 2024, indicating a 12% increase year-over-year.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here\u2019s what it is said regarding the company in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None. This article is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition adds to the bearish sentiment. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall trend appears negative due to the downgrades and concerns about future sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Apple is a popular stock among hedge funds, which are generally considered sophisticated investors. This suggests a positive outlook on the stock. The article also mentions Apple's consistent dividend growth and upcoming product releases, which are positive catalysts. However, the article also states that there are potentially better investment opportunities with higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article presents a mixed view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights that hedge funds are bullish on Apple (AAPL), citing its strong fundamentals, including consistent dividend growth, planned product launches (new iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air), and a high number of hedge fund holders (158).  While the article acknowledges AAPL's potential, it also suggests other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  The positive sentiment from hedge funds is a significant factor, but the article's somewhat muted overall assessment tempers the bullishness.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the overall market conditions and the article's suggestion of potentially better alternatives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of the best American stocks to buy and hold, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders). The company's focus on AI integration, particularly with the iPhone 16 launch and iOS 18, is expected to drive growth and monetization opportunities. Additionally, a bullish tech sector outlook under potential business-friendly policies from the Trump administration could benefit AAPL. However, challenges include slower iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese manufacturers and broader market risks like potential tariffs and volatility from policy uncertainties. The overall market is expected to grow moderately, with tech stocks potentially outperforming. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with notable risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the stock. Historically, downgrades tend to negatively impact stock prices. Additionally, the concerns cited about iPhone sales, such as increased competition in China and lack of compelling AI apps, are specific and potentially impactful. While the stock had a recent 7% two-day gain, it remains down 9% from its December record. Given the negative analyst sentiment and specific concerns about iPhone sales ahead of the company's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. This discrepancy suggests that the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or operations. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple Inc.'s stock price should be minimal. However, given that both companies are major players in the tech industry, any significant movement in one tech giant can have a ripple effect on others due to broader market sentiment. Since the news is positive for Meta Platforms, indicating growth and investment in emerging technologies like augmented reality and artificial intelligence, it could contribute to a positive overall sentiment in the tech sector, potentially benefiting Apple Inc. indirectly. Nonetheless, without direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are likely to be closer to a neutral stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there has been a downward revision in stock performance in 2025, with shares down roughly 8%. However, the earnings and sales estimates remain relatively stable, though growth is slowing. The focus on China results and Services segment could provide some positive insights, particularly if growth in China resumes. However, the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating suggests bearishness, and the skepticism around Apple Intelligence may impact investor sentiment negatively.\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The recent downgrade of Apple Inc. by Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition adds to the bearish sentiment. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall trend appears negative due to the downgrades and concerns about future sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.58, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.42, Reasoning: The article presents a generally positive outlook on Apple, highlighting its popularity among hedge funds, consistent dividend growth, and upcoming product releases. However, it also suggests that other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning bullish and others bearish. The fact that Apple is considered a 'safe' stock by hedge funds suggests stability, but the article's acknowledgment of potentially better opportunities tempers the bullishness. Given this mixed sentiment and the trend of previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a rise, but not overwhelmingly.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights the bullish sentiment of hedge funds, a significant factor given their sophisticated investment strategies and the high number of hedge fund holders (158), it also suggests that other stocks might offer better returns.  The article points to positive factors like consistent dividend growth and upcoming product launches. However, the overall tone is somewhat tempered, suggesting that while Apple is a solid investment, it might not be the *best* investment opportunity available.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely from 0.3 to 0.65 probability of a price rise, and the mixed signals in the article itself, a moderate probability of a price rise seems appropriate. The previous predictions also show a lack of consensus, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding AAPL's near-term prospects.  The absence of any significantly negative news in this particular article further supports a relatively neutral to slightly positive outlook.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The analysis of the financial news for Apple Inc. (AAPL) presents a mixed outlook. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of the best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders). The company's focus on AI integration, particularly with the iPhone 16 launch and iOS 18, is expected to drive growth and monetization opportunities.

Concerns over iPhone sales, particularly in China, and the lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps have led to a cautious stance among analysts. Given that the stock has recently experienced a 7% two-day gain but remains down 9% from its December record, and with Apple's earnings report approaching, the downgrades and concerns about iPhone sales growth are likely to impact the stock price negatively. However, the presence of mixed signals and the stock's recent performance suggest that while there is a higher likelihood of a stock price fall, it is not overwhelmingly so, as some predictions suggest a relatively balanced view with a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising than falling.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.52, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.48, Reasoning: The provided news headline and content are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. This discrepancy suggests that the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or operations. However, considering the positive sentiment in the tech sector due to Meta Platforms' growth and investment in emerging technologies, it could have a minimal indirect positive effect on Apple Inc. Given the lack of direct relevance and the mixed predictions from other models, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are likely to be closer to a neutral stance. Since the news is positive for the tech sector, I slightly lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, but the difference is minimal.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news highlights mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, the company's earnings and sales estimates remain relatively stable despite slower growth. The focus on China results and Services segment could provide some positive insights if there's improvement in China, and the positive trends in the Services segment are encouraging. However, the recent downgrades, notably the Zacks Rank #4 Sell rating, suggest bearishness among analysts. Additionally, the skepticism around Apple Intelligence and the ongoing competitive pressure in China continue to weigh on the stock. The recent earnings report and guidance will critically influence investor sentiment, especially regarding the adoption rate of Apple Intelligence and the performance in China.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
