(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple\nNews Content: For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

(AAPL) : Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nTo read this article on Zacks.com click here.\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The downgrade from Oppenheimer, along with multiple downgrades from other firms, indicates a growing concern about Apple's iPhone sales, particularly in China. The reported decline in iPhone sales and increased competition adds to the bearish sentiment. Although the stock recently experienced a two-day rally, the overall trend appears negative due to the downgrades and concerns about future sales. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.6, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.4, Reasoning: The news article highlights that Apple is a popular stock among hedge funds, which are generally considered sophisticated investors. This suggests a positive outlook on the stock. The article also mentions Apple's consistent dividend growth and upcoming product releases, which are positive catalysts. However, the article also states that there are potentially better investment opportunities with higher returns, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article presents a mixed view.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The news article highlights that hedge funds are bullish on Apple (AAPL), citing its strong fundamentals, including consistent dividend growth, planned product launches (new iPhone, iPad, MacBook Air), and a high number of hedge fund holders (158).  While the article acknowledges AAPL's potential, it also suggests other stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  The positive sentiment from hedge funds is a significant factor, but the article's somewhat muted overall assessment tempers the bullishness.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, considering the overall market conditions and the article's suggestion of potentially better alternatives.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.65, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.35, Reasoning: The analysis of the news suggests a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) in 2025. On the positive side, Apple is highlighted as one of the best American stocks to buy and hold, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders). The company's focus on AI integration, particularly with the iPhone 16 launch and iOS 18, is expected to drive growth and monetization opportunities. Additionally, a bullish tech sector outlook under potential business-friendly policies from the Trump administration could benefit AAPL. However, challenges include slower iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese manufacturers and broader market risks like potential tariffs and volatility from policy uncertainties. The overall market is expected to grow moderately, with tech stocks potentially outperforming. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but with notable risks.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) received another downgrade from Oppenheimer due to concerns over iPhone sales. This downgrade is the fifth this month, adding to the negative sentiment surrounding the stock. Historically, downgrades tend to negatively impact stock prices. Additionally, the concerns cited about iPhone sales, such as increased competition in China and lack of compelling AI apps, are specific and potentially impactful. While the stock had a recent 7% two-day gain, it remains down 9% from its December record. Given the negative analyst sentiment and specific concerns about iPhone sales ahead of the company's earnings report, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price falling than rising.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.55, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.45, Reasoning: The news headline and content provided are about Meta Platforms, not Apple Inc. This discrepancy suggests that the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or operations. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple Inc.'s stock price should be minimal. However, given that both companies are major players in the tech industry, any significant movement in one tech giant can have a ripple effect on others due to broader market sentiment. Since the news is positive for Meta Platforms, indicating growth and investment in emerging technologies like augmented reality and artificial intelligence, it could contribute to a positive overall sentiment in the tech sector, potentially benefiting Apple Inc. indirectly. Nonetheless, without direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are likely to be closer to a neutral stance.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The financial news indicates mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, there has been a downward revision in stock performance in 2025, with shares down roughly 8%. However, the earnings and sales estimates remain relatively stable, though growth is slowing. The focus on China results and Services segment could provide some positive insights, particularly if growth in China resumes. However, the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating suggests bearishness, and the skepticism around Apple Intelligence may impact investor sentiment negatively.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
