This discrepancy suggests that the news does not directly relate to Apple Inc.'s financial performance or operations. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple Inc.'s stock price should be minimal. However, given that both companies are major players in the tech industry, any significant movement in one tech giant can have a ripple effect on others due to broader market sentiment. Since the news is positive for Meta Platforms, indicating growth and investment in emerging technologies like augmented reality and artificial intelligence, it could contribute to a positive overall sentiment in the tech sector, potentially benefiting Apple Inc. indirectly. Nonetheless, without direct relevance to Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are likely to be closer to a neutral stance.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
