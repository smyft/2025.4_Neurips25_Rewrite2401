(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition\nNews Content: By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth on Thursday as its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season.\n\nThe company and its rivals Google and Samsung have been leaning on AI to drive sales of their devices. But Apple's latest iPhone 16 series lacked such features at launch in September and some of its AI services, including an improved Siri, are only expected later this year in some regions.\n\nApple's challenges with AI were highlighted this month when it had to pull a news-summarizing AI tool due to inaccurate headlines, which drew criticism from the BBC and other news outlets.\n\n\"AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple's handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\" said Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns Apple shares.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei as well as other Chinese smartphone makers, Apple saw its share of the global smartphone market narrow to 23% in the final three months of 2024 from almost 25% a year earlier, according to IDC data.\n\nThe decline was steeper in China - its third-largest market - where Apple's share fell by 10 percentage points to 17%, the data showed.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has been offering subsidies to smartphone purchasers to boost domestic consumption, these subsidies target low- to mid-tier phones priced below $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nWorries about iPhone demand have weighed on Apple shares this year, dragging them 5% lower so far in January.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to post revenue growth of 3.8% for the three months to December, Apple's first fiscal quarter, according to data from LSEG. That is well below the 6.1% growth the company posted in the September quarter, which included only a few days of new iPhone sales.\n\nSales of iPhone will likely tick up 1.9% in the first quarter, weaker than the 5.5% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nMac sales are expected to rise 2.3%, slightly faster compared with the previous three months, while iPad revenue is expected to increase by 4.2%, a slower pace than the fourth quarter.\n\nThe services business, which has in recent years outpaced growth in Apple's devices, is expected to post an increase of 12.9% in sales.\n\nLike other companies with a large global presence, Apple is also set to be hit by a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened by nearly 8% in the final three months of 2024 amid expectations for trade tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"With more than 50% of sales coming from outside of the Americas, the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen in the December quarter could make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates,\" warned Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China, indicates negative sentiment around Apple's growth prospects. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further suggest a bearish outlook. Additionally, the significant decline in iPhone shipments in China and increased competition are likely to weigh on investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, especially ahead of the upcoming earnings report where expectations are already set low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer acknowledges potential near-term disappointments (horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year), he also advises investors to hold the stock, citing Apple's exceptional management, high-quality products, and historical performance. He believes Apple controls its own future. However, the article also suggests that AI stocks might offer better returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone leans slightly negative in the short term due to the anticipated disappointment, but positive in the long term due to Apple's fundamentals. Given the short-term negative sentiment and the potential for a negative earnings surprise, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely in the immediate aftermath of the news. However, Cramer's advice to hold and the long-term positive outlook mitigate the potential for a significant drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy.  It does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors and not this particular news item.  We assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with the general market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as a 'widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, citing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone is mixed, with short-term pessimism balanced by long-term optimism. Given the anticipation of negative earnings and broader market uncertainty (Fed decisions, inflation data), the stock may face downward pressure in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's endorsement of holding the stock suggest resilience over time.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance may lead to low returns due to their high market capitalization and spending on each other. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant situation. This analysis implies a neutral to negative outlook for AAPL's stock price in the short term, as the news does not provide any specific positive catalysts for the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges faced by Apple, including delays in rolling out artificial intelligence features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a stronger US dollar. These factors are expected to impact iPhone demand and revenue growth. The article also mentions that Apple's share of the global smartphone market has narrowed, and the company's stock price has already declined 5% in January due to worries about iPhone demand. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.

Jim Cramer anticipates a 'widely anticipated disappointment' and lists several potential negative factors, including weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI lift, and a slowdown in service revenues. While he advises holding the stock due to Apple's strong fundamentals and management, the immediate impact of the anticipated negative news is likely to be a price decrease. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, most models leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the consistent negative outlook and the specific concerns raised by Cramer, I believe the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news article is about the general benefits of sector ETFs and contains no specific information about Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price.  However, the previous predictions show a range of opinions, mostly leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall.  These predictions cite various factors such as slower iPhone sales, increased competition, concerns about AI integration, and a generally cautious outlook from analysts.  While the news itself is neutral, the prevailing sentiment from other analyses suggests a bearish outlook for Apple in the short term.  Considering this context, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of other market factors influencing the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc.

Despite these short-term concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock due to Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The broader market context, including the Federal Reserve's decision and inflation data, adds to the uncertainty. Given the anticipation of negative earnings and the cautious sentiment, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term. However, the long-term outlook remains positive, which may mitigate a significant drop. Considering the previous predictions, which generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, this analysis aligns with that trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and their high market capitalization. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant situation, implying low returns. This analysis does not provide specific positive catalysts for AAPL's stock price in the short term. Additionally, previous predictions from various models indicate a generally negative outlook for AAPL's stock price, with probabilities of falling ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. Given this context, the news is likely to have a negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article presents a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to delays in rolling out artificial intelligence features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a stronger US dollar. These factors are expected to impact iPhone demand and revenue growth. The article also mentions that Apple's share of the global smartphone market has narrowed, and the company's stock price has already declined 5% in January due to worries about iPhone demand. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a trend of increasing bearish sentiment, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering these factors, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales in China and global markets, which has led to a negative outlook for Apple's stock. Notable analysts and commentators like Jim Cramer have expressed cautious sentiments, emphasizing the potential for near-term disappointment despite long-term positive fundamentals. Multiple recent downgrades and declining iPhone sales figures suggest a bearish trend. The probability of the stock price falling is relatively high given the current negative sentiment, especially considering the upcoming earnings report where low expectations are already set.\nRound: 2\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, coupled with concerns over slowing iPhone sales and increased competition in China, creates a negative sentiment around Apple's growth prospects. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further indicate a bearish outlook. Analysts have highlighted significant declines in iPhone shipments and a potential slowdown in the replacement cycle, which are likely to weigh on investor confidence. Although some analysts maintain a long-term positive outlook due to Apple's strong fundamentals, the immediate sentiment is negative, especially with the upcoming earnings report where expectations are already low. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news headline and content clearly indicate a negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report, with Jim Cramer anticipating a 'widely anticipated disappointment.'

The trend in previous predictions also shows an increasing bearish sentiment.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The provided news article about sector ETFs is irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  The analysis should therefore focus on the previous predictions.  The overwhelming consensus among the previous models is a bearish outlook for Apple, with most predicting a higher probability of a price fall.  Reasons cited include slower iPhone sales, increased competition, concerns about AI integration, and a generally cautious outlook from analysts like Jim Cramer, who anticipates a 'widely anticipated disappointment' in the upcoming earnings report. While some models acknowledge Apple's strong fundamentals and long-term potential, the short-term sentiment is heavily negative.  Considering this consistent negative outlook and the lack of positive news, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, aligning with the majority of previous predictions.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article presents a cautious outlook for Apple Inc.
