(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China, indicates negative sentiment around Apple's growth prospects. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further suggest a bearish outlook. Additionally, the significant decline in iPhone shipments in China and increased competition are likely to weigh on investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, especially ahead of the upcoming earnings report where expectations are already set low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer acknowledges potential near-term disappointments (horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year), he also advises investors to hold the stock, citing Apple's exceptional management, high-quality products, and historical performance. He believes Apple controls its own future. However, the article also suggests that AI stocks might offer better returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone leans slightly negative in the short term due to the anticipated disappointment, but positive in the long term due to Apple's fundamentals. Given the short-term negative sentiment and the potential for a negative earnings surprise, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely in the immediate aftermath of the news. However, Cramer's advice to hold and the long-term positive outlook mitigate the potential for a significant drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy.  It does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors and not this particular news item.  We assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with the general market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as a 'widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, citing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone is mixed, with short-term pessimism balanced by long-term optimism. Given the anticipation of negative earnings and broader market uncertainty (Fed decisions, inflation data), the stock may face downward pressure in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's endorsement of holding the stock suggest resilience over time.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance may lead to low returns due to their high market capitalization and spending on each other. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant situation. This analysis implies a neutral to negative outlook for AAPL's stock price in the short term, as the news does not provide any specific positive catalysts for the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges faced by Apple, including delays in rolling out artificial intelligence features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a stronger US dollar. These factors are expected to impact iPhone demand and revenue growth. The article also mentions that Apple's share of the global smartphone market has narrowed, and the company's stock price has already declined 5% in January due to worries about iPhone demand. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
