      "content": "Analyze this financial news and estimate stock price movement probabilities.\nCompany: Apple Inc. (AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded as Slowing iPhone Sales, China Weakness Raise Concerns\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares dipped Wednesday after Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to Perform from Outperform, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China ahead of the company's Q1 fiscal 2025 earningsrelease. Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China, indicates negative sentiment around Apple's growth prospects. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further suggest a bearish outlook. Additionally, the significant decline in iPhone shipments in China and increased competition are likely to weigh on investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, especially ahead of the upcoming earnings report where expectations are already set low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer acknowledges potential near-term disappointments (horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year), he also advises investors to hold the stock, citing Apple's exceptional management, high-quality products, and historical performance. He believes Apple controls its own future. However, the article also suggests that AI stocks might offer better returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone leans slightly negative in the short term due to the anticipated disappointment, but positive in the long term due to Apple's fundamentals. Given the short-term negative sentiment and the potential for a negative earnings surprise, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely in the immediate aftermath of the news. However, Cramer's advice to hold and the long-term positive outlook mitigate the potential for a significant drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy.  It does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors and not this particular news item.  We assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with the general market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as a 'widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, citing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone is mixed, with short-term pessimism balanced by long-term optimism. Given the anticipation of negative earnings and broader market uncertainty (Fed decisions, inflation data), the stock may face downward pressure in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's endorsement of holding the stock suggest resilience over time.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance may lead to low returns due to their high market capitalization and spending on each other. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant situation. This analysis implies a neutral to negative outlook for AAPL's stock price in the short term, as the news does not provide any specific positive catalysts for the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges faced by Apple, including delays in rolling out artificial intelligence features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a stronger US dollar. These factors are expected to impact iPhone demand and revenue growth. The article also mentions that Apple's share of the global smartphone market has narrowed, and the company's stock price has already declined 5% in January due to worries about iPhone demand. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction.
