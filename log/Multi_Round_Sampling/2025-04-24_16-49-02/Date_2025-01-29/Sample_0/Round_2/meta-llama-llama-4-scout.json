(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Why Mag 7 domination mimics a 'snake eating its own tail'\nNews Content: The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments\n\nNext I will provide you some predictions of stock price movement probabilities and the corresponding analysis by others in the previous rounds.\nNote that others' predictions may indicate that they have some other information about the stock price. A high prediction may indicate that they have some positive information about the stock, while a low prediction may indicate that they have some megative information about the stock.\nAlso note that there are multiple rounds of precitions, demonstrating the trend of others' beliefs.\nPlease take these information into consideration when prediction the stock price movement probabilities.\nPrevious predictions:\nRound: 0\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China, indicates negative sentiment around Apple's growth prospects. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further suggest a bearish outlook. Additionally, the significant decline in iPhone shipments in China and increased competition are likely to weigh on investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, especially ahead of the upcoming earnings report where expectations are already set low.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Jim Cramer acknowledges potential near-term disappointments (horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year), he also advises investors to hold the stock, citing Apple's exceptional management, high-quality products, and historical performance. He believes Apple controls its own future. However, the article also suggests that AI stocks might offer better returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone leans slightly negative in the short term due to the anticipated disappointment, but positive in the long term due to Apple's fundamentals. Given the short-term negative sentiment and the potential for a negative earnings surprise, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely in the immediate aftermath of the news. However, Cramer's advice to hold and the long-term positive outlook mitigate the potential for a significant drop.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.5, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.5, Reasoning: The news article discusses the benefits of investing in sector ETFs for diversification, a general investment strategy.  It does not contain any specific information about Apple Inc. (AAPL). Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Any price movement would be due to other market factors and not this particular news item.  We assume the probability of price movement remains consistent with the general market trends.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.4, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.6, Reasoning: The news article highlights Jim Cramer's cautious stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) ahead of its earnings report, describing it as a 'widely anticipated disappointment.' Cramer mentions potential negative factors such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock rather than trading it, citing Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The overall tone is mixed, with short-term pessimism balanced by long-term optimism. Given the anticipation of negative earnings and broader market uncertainty (Fed decisions, inflation data), the stock may face downward pressure in the short term. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and Cramer's endorsement of holding the stock suggest resilience over time.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and how their dominance may lead to low returns due to their high market capitalization and spending on each other. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant situation. This analysis implies a neutral to negative outlook for AAPL's stock price in the short term, as the news does not provide any specific positive catalysts for the company.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news article highlights several challenges faced by Apple, including delays in rolling out artificial intelligence features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a stronger US dollar. These factors are expected to impact iPhone demand and revenue growth. The article also mentions that Apple's share of the global smartphone market has narrowed, and the company's stock price has already declined 5% in January due to worries about iPhone demand. Based on this analysis, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: -1, Prediction of stock price falling: -1, Reasoning: Fail to give a prediction. Error Reason: Parse error\nRound: 1\nModel: openai/gpt-4o-mini, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.25, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.75, Reasoning: The downgrade by Oppenheimer, citing slower iPhone sales and market share losses in China, indicates a negative sentiment around Apple's growth prospects. The removal of the price target and reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further suggest a bearish outlook. Additionally, the significant decline in iPhone shipments in China and increased competition are likely to weigh on investor confidence. While some analysts maintain a long-term positive outlook due to Apple's strong fundamentals, the immediate sentiment is negative, especially ahead of the earnings report where expectations are already low. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising.\nModel: google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The news headline and content clearly indicate a negative sentiment towards Apple's upcoming earnings report. Jim Cramer anticipates a 'widely anticipated disappointment' and lists several potential negative factors, including weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI lift, and a slowdown in service revenues. While he advises holding the stock due to Apple's strong fundamentals and management, the immediate impact of the anticipated negative news is likely to be a price decrease. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, most models leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price falling. Given the consistent negative outlook and the specific concerns raised by Cramer, I believe the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising.\nModel: google/gemini-flash-1.5, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The provided news article is about the general benefits of sector ETFs and contains no specific information about Apple.  Therefore, it's unlikely to directly impact Apple's stock price.  However, the previous predictions show a range of opinions, mostly leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall.  These predictions cite various factors such as slower iPhone sales, increased competition, concerns about AI integration, and a generally cautious outlook from analysts.  While the news itself is neutral, the prevailing sentiment from other analyses suggests a bearish outlook for Apple in the short term.  Considering this context, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of other market factors influencing the stock price.\nModel: deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.35, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.65, Reasoning: The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer anticipates a 'widely anticipated disappointment' in the upcoming earnings report, citing potential issues such as weak Chinese cell phone orders, lack of AI-driven growth, slowdown in service revenues, and lackluster Vision Pro sales. Despite these short-term concerns, Cramer advises holding the stock due to Apple's strong management and long-term potential. The broader market context, including the Federal Reserve's decision and inflation data, adds to the uncertainty. Given the anticipation of negative earnings and the cautious sentiment, the stock is more likely to face downward pressure in the short term. However, the long-term outlook remains positive, which may mitigate a significant drop. Considering the previous predictions, which generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, this analysis aligns with that trend.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-4-scout, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.3, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.7, Reasoning: The provided news discusses the 'Magnificent Seven' tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and their high market capitalization. The metaphor of a 'snake eating its own tail' suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant situation, implying low returns. This analysis does not provide specific positive catalysts for AAPL's stock price in the short term. Additionally, previous predictions from various models indicate a generally negative outlook for AAPL's stock price, with probabilities of falling ranging from 0.6 to 0.75. Given this context, the news is likely to have a negative impact on AAPL's stock price.\nModel: meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The news article presents a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL) due to delays in rolling out artificial intelligence features, increased competition from Chinese smartphone makers, and a stronger US dollar. These factors are expected to impact iPhone demand and revenue growth. The article also mentions that Apple's share of the global smartphone market has narrowed, and the company's stock price has already declined 5% in January due to worries about iPhone demand. Additionally, the previous predictions from other models show a trend of increasing bearish sentiment, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering these factors, it is likely that the stock price will fall due to this news.\nModel: qwen/qwen-turbo, Prediction of stock price rising: 0.2, Prediction of stock price falling: 0.8, Reasoning: The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns over iPhone sales in China and global markets, which has led to a negative outlook for Apple's stock. Notable analysts and commentators like Jim Cramer have expressed cautious sentiments, emphasizing the potential for near-term disappointment despite long-term positive fundamentals. Multiple recent downgrades and declining iPhone sales figures suggest a bearish trend. The probability of the stock price falling is relatively high given the current negative sentiment, especially considering the upcoming earnings report where low expectations are already set.\n\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
