Given that the news does not specifically highlight Apple Inc. or provide any directly positive information about the company, it's reasonable to assume a relatively balanced but slightly leaning towards a negative view. Therefore, I've estimated a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising. However, the probabilities are close to neutral, reflecting the overall mixed nature of the tech sector as described."
