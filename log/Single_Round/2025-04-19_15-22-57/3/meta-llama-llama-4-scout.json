This generally indicates a negative market movement for tech stocks like Apple. Additionally, the content mentions an increase in the personal consumption and expenditures index, which could imply potential inflation and affect the stock market. Given this context, I've estimated a lower probability of Apple's stock price rising (30%) and a higher probability of it falling (70%)."
