(AAPL) as it mentions that the company posted better-than-expected earnings and guided for solid growth.\n- Generally, when a company reports better-than-expected earnings and provides a positive outlook, its stock price tends to increase.\n- The overall tone of the news for AAPL is positive, suggesting a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling.\n\nTherefore, the estimated probabilities are:\n- **Probability of stock price rise:** 0.7 (or 70%)\n- **Probability of stock price fall:** 0.3 (or 30%)\n\nThese probabilities reflect the immediate positive impact of Apple's better-than-expected earnings report and guidance on its stock price. However, stock market movements can be influenced by a myriad of factors including but not limited to overall market conditions, sector performance, and future company-specific announcements."
