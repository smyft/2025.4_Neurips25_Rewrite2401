Apple's stock price will likely be heavily influenced by its own earnings report.  A strong earnings beat could boost investor confidence and drive the stock price up, while a miss or disappointing guidance could lead to a decline.  However, the overall market sentiment, influenced by the broader economic outlook and other tech company earnings, will also play a significant role.  Given the uncertainty, assigning precise probabilities is difficult, but a slightly higher probability is assigned to a price rise based on the general expectation that strong corporate earnings can support the market, even with higher interest rates.  This is not a guarantee, and external factors could easily outweigh the impact of Apple's earnings.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
