The content implies that with the Fed unlikely to cut interest rates quickly, corporate earnings growth is crucial. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major company with significant influence on the market. If Apple's earnings growth is strong, it could potentially revive the stock rally. However, if the earnings growth is weak, it could further dampen the market sentiment. Given the general nature of the news, it does not specifically highlight Apple's strengths or weaknesses, so the impact is somewhat neutral but leaning towards caution. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to general market caution and the importance of earnings growth.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investors Hope Earnings Season Can Revive Faltering Stock Rally\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
