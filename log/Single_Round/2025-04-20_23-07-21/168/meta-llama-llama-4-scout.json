This development might be perceived as a threat to Apple's dominance in the mobile gaming market, potentially impacting its revenue. Given this context, there is a likelihood that Apple's stock price could fall due to concerns about increased competition and potential loss of market share. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty, ecosystem, and significant market presence might mitigate the negative impact. Based on this analysis, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising at 0.3 and the probability of the stock price falling at 0.7.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Epic Games Takes on Google, Apple With Third-Party Games on Company's Own App Marketplace\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7,\n}\n```"
