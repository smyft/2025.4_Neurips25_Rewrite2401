While this could be seen as a competitive threat to Apple's App Store, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal for several reasons. First, the article is behind a paywall, limiting the full understanding of the news's impact. Second, Epic Games' marketplace is unlikely to immediately pose a significant threat to Apple's dominant market share in the iOS app ecosystem.  Apple's App Store generates substantial revenue and is deeply integrated into the iOS ecosystem.  The news might cause a slight, temporary dip due to market uncertainty, but the overall impact on Apple's long-term financial performance is expected to be negligible. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the overall market stability and Apple's strong financial position.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Epic Games Takes on Google, Apple With Third-Party Games on Company's Own App Marketplace\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
