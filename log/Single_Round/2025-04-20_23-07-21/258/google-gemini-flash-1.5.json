(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's $250 Price Target: The iPhone 17 Bet That Could Send Shares Soaring\nNews Content: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just got a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, landing on the firm's Tactical Outperform List. The call? Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside? The setup looks asymmetrically interesting.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Evercore ISI's positive outlook, a $250 price target (implying upside from the current price), and the anticipation of the iPhone 17's launch contribute to a bullish sentiment.  While concerns exist about China's market, the analysts believe Apple can overcome this due to emerging market growth and potential market share gains from Huawei's struggles. The expectation is for Apple to simply demonstrate resilience, not necessarily exceed expectations dramatically, to drive the stock price higher.  The article highlights the asymmetric risk-reward profile, suggesting the potential for significant upside outweighs the downside risk. However, it's important to note that this is just one analyst's opinion, and the market's reaction can be unpredictable.  The probabilities are assigned considering the overall positive tone of the news, but acknowledging inherent market volatility.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's $250 Price Target: The iPhone 17 Bet That Could Send Shares Soaring\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.7,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}\n```\n"
