(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple, Indonesia Near Agreement to Lift iPhone 16 Sales Ban, Bloomberg Report Says\nNews Content: Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financials) is allegedly close to settling a spat with Indonesia that stopped importing its iPhone 16 series, therefore stopping sales of the product. Bloomberg reports that Indonesian authorities expect a settlement within weeks that would allay worries about the company's adherence to local investment rules.\n\nImplemented in October 2024, the restriction was related to Indonesia's local content policies, which demand that certain of cellphones or their components be produced locally. Apple's first promised $10 million in funding was judged insufficient, hence the government decided to limit iPhone 16 sales. Apple responded by increasing their suggested expenditure to $1 billion, including intentions for an AirTag facility. Still, the presence of AirTagsclassified as accessories rather than necessary smartphone componentsdid not satisfy legal requirements.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, Indonesian Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani showed hope for a resolution of the problem. The minister said that differences in local content requirement computation have been found and are under correction. The fix would allow Apple to satisfy the necessary criteria and start national iPhone 16 series sales once again.\n\nReaching a deal might allow Apple to once again access one of the biggest consumer markets in Southeast Asia, hence increasing sales in the area, according to the report.\n\nApple has not yet commented on the topic.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
