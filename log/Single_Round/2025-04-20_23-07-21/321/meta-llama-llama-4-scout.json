SoftBank is a Japanese conglomerate that has investments in various companies, but the news does not establish a clear connection to Apple Inc. (AAPL). As a result, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"What Companies Does SoftBank Own?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n\nNote that I've assumed that the news is neutral with respect to Apple's stock price, and assigned probabilities that reflect a lack of direct impact from the news. The probabilities of a stock price rise or fall are roughly equal, reflecting a neutral outlook. \n\nHowever, to make it clear that this is a neutral news, let's assume 10% chance of it having unpredictable impact:\n\n```\n{\n  \"reasoning\": \"The news article is about SoftBank's portfolio and does not directly relate to Apple Inc.
