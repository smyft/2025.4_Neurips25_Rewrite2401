As a major technology company, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is likely to be influenced by overall market trends. Given the positive market sentiment, it is reasonable to assume that Apple's stock price may also rise. However, without more specific information about Apple's performance or Trump's policies affecting the tech industry, the probability of a stock price rise is not extremely high. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"US Equities Markets End Higher Tuesday as Trump Takes Office\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}"
