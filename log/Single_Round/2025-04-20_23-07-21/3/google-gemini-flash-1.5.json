The broader market context is also negative, with the Dow Jones diving due to Trump's tariff order. While the inflation data (PCE) is relevant to the overall economy and could impact Apple indirectly, the headline's focus is on the immediate negative impact on Apple's stock price.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short term, immediately following this news.  However, it's important to note that this is a short-term prediction based on limited information and doesn't account for long-term factors or other news that may emerge.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stock Market Today: Dow Jones Dives On Trump Tariff Order; Apple, Nvidia Break Key Levels As MicroStrategy Makes This Move (Live Coverage)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```\n"
