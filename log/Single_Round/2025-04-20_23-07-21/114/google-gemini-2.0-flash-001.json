The negative aspects include: 1) US stock futures are falling due to the tech sector's tumble, influenced by DeepSeek AI, suggesting broader market negativity impacting tech stocks. 2) The mention of 'Nasdaq falls 3%, DeepSeek AI concerns wallop tech sector' directly indicates negative sentiment towards the tech sector. The positive aspects include: 1) Apple is one of the Magnificent Seven companies, which often receive significant investor attention. 2) The upcoming earnings report provides an opportunity for Apple to positively surprise the market. 3) Pfizer gains after activist investor forgoes board nominations, which indicates that there are some positive news in the market. However, the negative sentiment surrounding the tech sector and the potential impact of DeepSeek AI seem to outweigh the positive aspects in the short term. The Federal Reserve meeting adds uncertainty, but its direct impact on Apple is less immediate than the AI and earnings concerns. Given the initial negative reaction and the broader tech sector concerns, a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock price is more likely in the immediate short term. However, the earnings report could be a catalyst for a reversal.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Stocks react to DeepSeek AI, tech earnings, Fed meeting: 3 Things\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
