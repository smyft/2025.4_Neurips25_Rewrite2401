(AAPL) unless there is a specific mention of Apple's involvement in the metaverse. However, Apple has shown interest in augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, which are integral to the metaverse. This could lead to a positive sentiment among investors if they perceive that Apple is well-positioned to benefit from the growth of the metaverse. Therefore, while the news is somewhat vague, it could still generate optimism about Apple's future prospects in this area.
