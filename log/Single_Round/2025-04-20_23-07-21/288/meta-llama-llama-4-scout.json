(AAPL) or its involvement in the metaverse. However, Apple is known for its innovative products and has been rumored to be working on AR/VR technology, which could be related to the metaverse. The lack of direct connection between the news and Apple's specific actions or announcements suggests a neutral to slightly positive impact, as the metaverse is a growing area of interest and Apple's potential involvement could be seen as a long-term opportunity.
