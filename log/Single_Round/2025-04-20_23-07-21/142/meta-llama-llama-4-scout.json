This action by a prominent investor could be perceived as a negative signal for Apple's stock, suggesting that Cohen may have lost confidence in Apple's growth prospects compared to the AI stock. However, it's essential to note that stock movements are influenced by a myriad of factors, and one investor's action does not dictate the overall market's sentiment. Given this context, there might be a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price falling due to this news, as investors might interpret Cohen's move as a sign of waning confidence in Apple's future growth. However, the overall impact is likely to be minimal as the news does not provide any fundamentally negative information about Apple's financial health or future prospects.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up500% in Less Than3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```"
