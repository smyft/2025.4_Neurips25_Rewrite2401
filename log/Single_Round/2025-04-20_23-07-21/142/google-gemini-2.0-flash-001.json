On one hand, a prominent investor, Steven Cohen, selling Apple stock could be interpreted negatively, potentially signaling a lack of confidence in Apple's future growth or a reallocation of assets to more promising opportunities. On the other hand, the investment in a rapidly growing AI stock could be seen as a strategic move towards higher-growth sectors, which might indirectly benefit Apple if AI integration becomes a significant factor in Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be slightly negative, as the news focuses on the sale of Apple shares. The magnitude of the impact is likely to be small, given Apple's size and the fact that this is just one investor's decision. The market's reaction will also depend on broader market trends and other news related to Apple.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.40,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.60\n}\n```"
