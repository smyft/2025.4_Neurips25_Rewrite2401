(AAPL)\nNews Headline: After shutting down, TikTok returns following Trump comments\nNews Content: TikTok is running again in the United States after President-elect Donald Trump announced Sunday via Truth Social (DJT) that he will issue an executive order on Monday to extend the period of time before a ban takes effect \"so that we can make a deal to protect our national security.\"\n\nHere is TikTok's statement:\n\n\"In agreement with our service providers, TikTok is in the process of restoring service. We thank President Trump for providing the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans and allowing over 7 million small businesses to thrive. It\u2019s a strong stand for the First Amendment and against arbitrary censorship. We will work with President Trump on a long-term solution that keeps TikTok in the United States.\"\n\nTikTok briefly shut down in the United States on Saturday evening. The social media app went dark after the US Supreme Court determined that national security concerns outweighed TikTok's First Amendment argument against a law that was signed in April 2024. ByteDance, TikTok's Chinese parent company, also had the option to divest its stake in the platform, but it chose not to despite there being interested buyers.
