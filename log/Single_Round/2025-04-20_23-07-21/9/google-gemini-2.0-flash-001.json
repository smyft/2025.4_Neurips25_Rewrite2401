This is driven by inflation data meeting expectations, which suggests the Federal Reserve is unlikely to aggressively tighten monetary policy. While the full article is behind a paywall, the available snippet suggests positive earnings reports are also contributing to the market's upward trend. This generally creates a favorable environment for large-cap stocks like Apple. However, without the full article, the specific impact on Apple is difficult to assess precisely. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the news is market-wide and not company-specific.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"US Equity Indexes Trade Close to Record Highs as Fed's Preferred Inflation Gauge Meets Expectations\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
