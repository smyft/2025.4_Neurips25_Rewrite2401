The market's reaction will depend on whether the earnings meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Secondly, the release of Q4 GDP data, expected to show slowing growth, could negatively impact market sentiment generally, and potentially Apple's stock. However, the impact on Apple might be less direct than the earnings report. Finally, home sales data is less directly relevant to Apple's performance. Considering these factors, the earnings report is the most significant driver. Without knowing the earnings expectations, it's difficult to give a precise probability. I'm assuming a slightly positive outlook, as Apple is a strong company, but the slowing GDP growth introduces some uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple earnings, Q4 GDP data, home sales: What to Watch\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
