(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple's Q1 in Focus: Analyst Warns of Challenges Despite 4% Revenue Growth Forecast\nNews Content: KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Brandon Nispel focuses on Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) fiscal first-quarter results, due on January 30, on handset sales as the defining element for the results and the company's near-term forecast.\n\nStaying with his \"underweight\" rating and $200 price target, Nispel points out that Apple's guidance might not satisfy market expectations even if it looks likely to match Wall Street's earnings projections. He notes conflicting data trends; the corporation shows progress over the worse performance of last year but falls short of its usual seasonal performance.\n\nWith Apple sales up 2.1% to $71.2 billion, projections for the December quarter anticipate income at $124.33 billion, a 4% increase from the previous year. Nispel does draw attention to challenges including the absence of an AI-driven update cycle, an iPhone 16 ban in Indonesia, and Chinese competitive pressures, though.\n\nLooking ahead, March-quarter iPhone sales could reach $48.11 billion, with Nispel warning that the iPhone SE might lower demand for the iPhone 16. Furthermore limited is growth in iPads, Macs, and wearables.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
