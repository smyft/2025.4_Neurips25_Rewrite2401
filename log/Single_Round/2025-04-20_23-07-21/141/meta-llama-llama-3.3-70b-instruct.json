      "content": "{\n\"reasoning\": \"The news article mentions that Apple Inc. (AAPL) is scheduled to release its quarterly earnings report, which is a significant event that can impact the stock price. The article also mentions the Federal Reserve's interest rate decision, which can have a broader impact on the market. However, the article does not provide any specific information about Apple's earnings expectations or the potential impact of the interest rate decision on the company. Given the lack of specific information, I will assume that the earnings report and interest rate decision have an equal chance of positively or negatively impacting the stock price. Additionally, the mention of artificial intelligence as a central theme in the earnings reports could be seen as a positive factor for Apple, as the company has been investing heavily in AI research and development. Therefore, I will assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
