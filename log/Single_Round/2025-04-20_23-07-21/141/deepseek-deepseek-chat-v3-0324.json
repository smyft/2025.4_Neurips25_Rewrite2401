Apple's earnings report will be closely watched, especially for insights into its performance in AI and other key areas. Positive earnings could lead to a stock price rise, while disappointing results could cause a decline. The Fed's rate decision is also critical; a dovish stance (no rate hike or hints of future cuts) could boost tech stocks, including Apple, while a hawkish stance might pressure them. Given Apple's strong historical performance and market position, the probability of a positive reaction is slightly higher, but uncertainty around the Fed's decision tempers this optimism.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Big Tech earnings, Fed rate decision: What to Watch Next Week\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
