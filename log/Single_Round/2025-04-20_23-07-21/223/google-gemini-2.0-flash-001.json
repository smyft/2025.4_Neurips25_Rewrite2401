(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Barclays price target raised to 350 GBp from 320 GBp at Deutsche Bank\nNews Content: https://www.tipranks.com/news/the-fly/barclays-price-target-raised-to-350-gbp-from-320-gbp-at-deutsche-bank\n\nDeutsche Bank raised the firm\u2019s price target on Barclays (BCS) to 350 GBp from 320 GBp and keeps a Buy rating on the shares. Even if you give Barclays no credit for the least predictable parts of their strategy, the shares offer significant value, the firm told investors in a research note on Friday. Barclays trades at an implied cost of equity of 18%. There is clearly embedded skepticism in the valuation which Deutsche attributes to two primary factors, namely the plan to take market share in the investment bank on the same capital base, and growth in the U.S. consumer business but at much wider margins.\n\nInvest with Confidence:\n\nFollow TipRanks' Top Wall Street Analysts to uncover their success rate and average return.

While the article mentions Apple in the context of Barclays potentially taking over the Goldman Sachs credit card partnership, this is indirect and doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price in a significant way based solely on this news. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal and could go either way depending on broader market sentiment and other news related to Apple. Given the indirect nature of the news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral or slightly positive movement, but acknowledging the uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Barclays price target raised to 350 GBp from 320 GBp at Deutsche Bank\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
