While this highlights the significant weight of AI in the index, it doesn't directly relate to Apple's performance or prospects.  Apple is a major technology company, and while it is involved in AI, this news item doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's AI initiatives or financial performance. Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  The probability of a price change is assumed to be close to the baseline probability of a price increase or decrease on any given day, which is generally considered to be around 50/50 in the absence of specific company-related news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Make Up 28.8% of the Entire S&P 500 Index\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```\n"
