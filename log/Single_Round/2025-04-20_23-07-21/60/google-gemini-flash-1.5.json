(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer on Slower iPhone Sales, China Market Pressures\nNews Content: Apple (AAPL, Financials) was downgraded to Perform from Outperform by Oppenheimer ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, with analysts citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.\n\nPointing to a reduced iPhone sales forecast over the next 12 to 18 months, the investment group also eliminated its $250 price estimate on the shares. Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

The cited reasons \u2013 slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, and a lack of compelling AI-related applications to drive upgrades \u2013 are substantial headwinds.  While the market may have already partially priced in some negative sentiment, the downgrade from a reputable firm adds weight to the bearish outlook.  The upcoming earnings report will be crucial, but the pre-announcement news suggests a higher probability of disappointing results, further pressuring the stock price.  The removal of the $250 price target also indicates a significant downward revision of the analyst's valuation.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise, although a positive surprise in earnings could mitigate the negative impact.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Downgraded by Oppenheimer on Slower iPhone Sales, China Market Pressures\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.25,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.75\n}\n```\n"
