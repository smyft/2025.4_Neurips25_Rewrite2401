(AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls for Thursday, January 23, has been for Apple Inc. Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cBuy\u201d and lowered its price target to $280 per share from $286. The price target downgrade, driven by lower iPhone sales, comes ahead of the company\u2019s December-quarter earnings report next week. The firm anticipates the tech giant to report fiscal Q1 earnings per share of $2.35, in line with consensus, and revenue of $124.2B versus the consensus of $124.8B. According to the firm, even though the competition within the Chinese market is increasing, it is optimistic about accelerating iPhone growth in fiscal 2026. This iPhone growth will largely be driven by the continued rollout of Apple Intelligence with a more robust feature set.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate market sentiment to improve midyear, which is a seasonally strong period for the stock, as concerns about Apple Intelligence\u2019s limited impact on iPhone demand and competition in China are replaced by optimism over the new slate of Apple Intelligence features revealed at WWDC 2025, the launch of new Mac, iPad and iPhone SE products in spring 2025, and potential new features for the iPhone 17/18 in fall 2025/26\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street.
