(AAPL)\nNews Headline: US stocks plunge over China\u2019s AI threat\nNews Content: China\u2019s Deepseek AI chatbot has triggered a sell-off in major tech stocks - Lam Yik/Bloomberg\n\nUS stock markets have plunged at their sharpest pace in five months after a China AI start-up unveiled a new chatbot which threatens to match its major global competitors at a lower cost.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index on Wall Street plummeted by 3.6pc at the opening bell - its biggest fall since September - as DeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot triggered market turmoil.\n\nAI-focused shares in the US and Europe were at one point on track for $1 trillion to be wiped off their valuation, according to Bloomberg, after the China app soared to the top of the Apple Store\u2019s download charts.\n\nDeepSeek stunned industry insiders with its ability to match its US competitors and said it had spent only $5.6m (\u00a34.5m) developing its model.\n\nBy contrast, Microsoft has already ploughed $14bn into ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Its shares dropped 3.5pc in New York, knocking more than $119bn (\u00a395bn) off its valuation.\n\nWilliam Beavington of Jefferies said: \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly remarkable to us really is the cost effectiveness and the efficiency they have driven from the chips being used.\u201d\n\nChip making giant Nvidia was down 13pc, wiping nearly $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off the value of the world\u2019s dominant supplier of AI hardware and software. It had already closed down more than 3pc on Wall Street on Friday.\n\nJapanese tech conglomerate SoftBank was down more than 8pc overnight, less than a week after it was announced as a key investor in US President Donald Trump\u2019s new $500bn (\u00a3401bn) venture to build infrastructure for artificial intelligence in the United States.\n\nDeepSeek was developed by a start-up based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, known for its high density of tech firms.\n\nAvailable as an app or on desktop, it can do many of the things that its Western competitors can do - write song lyrics, help work on a personal development plan, or even write a recipe for dinner based on what\u2019s in the fridge.\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen, a close advisor to Trump, described it as \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment\u201d - a reference to the Soviet satellite launch that sparked the Cold War space race.\n\nScale AI\u2019s Alexandr Wang wrote on X that DeepSeek \u201cis a wake up call for America\u201d.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:15 PM GMT\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today on this live blog covering DeepSeek and the Wall Street tech sell-off.\n\nCurrently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is down 3.4pc. Nvidia is down 16.6pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 is down 1.9pc and Dow Jones Industrial Average, of 30 leading US companies, has regained its earlier losses. It is currently up 0.1pc.\n\nStory Continues\n\n05:55 PM GMT\n\nReaders discuss what DeepSeek means to Western tech giants\n\nTelegraph subscribers have been weighing in on the implications of DeepSeek. You can carry on the conversation in the comments.\n\n05:51 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek a \u2018double-edged sword\u2019 for tech giants, says economist\n\nUS tech giants face a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d from DeepSeek, and could benefit from it, an economist has said.\n\nJohn Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said that the so-called \u201chyperscalers\u201d, the tech giants operating data centres that offer cloud computing, \u201cdon\u2019t seem to be in a rush to scale back investment in AI\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cMeanwhile, Stargate [a $500bn (\u00a3400bn) investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure] suggests a general push in the opposite direction, ie, the need for more, not less, investment in the technology in the US.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, if it became clear that AI models could indeed be trained effectively with less high-end computing power than had previously been assumed, there would clearly be a risk of a further correction in the US stock market. That\u2019s because this would potentially undermine the dominant positions of some firms that have powered the rally.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, while such an outcome would conceivably be detrimental for the semiconductor industry, it would potentially be a double-edged sword for some hyperscalers (insofar as it lowered their capital costs, but undermined their dominance in the marketplace). And it would presumably be beneficial for users and consumers of cheaper and easier-to-access AI models.\u201d\n\n05:32 PM GMT\n\nUS sell-off hits European tech firms\n\nThe sell-off of tech firms in the US also spread to continental Europe. In the Netherlands, chip equipment giant ASML dropped 7pc to touch a two-month low and ASM International slumping more than 12pc.\n\nTwo Germany business that provide electric hardware for AI infrastructure tanked. Siemens Energy plunged 19.9pc, while Schneider Electric fell 9.6pc. They were among the weakest performers on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.\n\nThe sell-off comes after the Stoxx 600 touched an intra-day record high on Friday and as investors await earnings from U.S. tech giants Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla later this week.\n\n05:22 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek won\u2019t destroy demand for AI chips, says investment manager\n\nChipmakers have taken a pounding today on the back of reports that China\u2019s DeepSeek can deliver good AI without lots of hardware.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is down 15.7pc. The tech titan is known as the leader in GPUs, the advanced semiconductors needed to run AI applications.\n\nMeanwhile ARM has lost 10pc and AMD is down 5.8pc. Intel dropped 2.9pc.\n\nJay Hatfield, chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not good for ChatGPT to have an aggressive competitor, but we don\u2019t buy the thesis that this is going to tank the demand for high-end GPUs.\u201d\n\n05:17 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek will unleash Chinese innovation, says tech analyst\n\nBen Thompson, whose Stratechery newsletter is widely read by tech industry leaders, said today that China is \u201ca big winner, in ways that I suspect will only become apparent over time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNot only does the country have access to DeepSeek, but I suspect that DeepSeek\u2019s relative success to America\u2019s leading AI labs will result in a further unleashing of Chinese innovation as they realise they can compete\u201d.\n\nHe also said that consumers could get a big win here, since the AI is \u201copen sourced\u201d.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has provided a massive gift to nearly everyone. The biggest winners are consumers and businesses who can anticipate a future of effectively-free AI products and services,\u201d he said.\n\n04:54 PM GMT\n\nInvestors make flight to safety after Nvidia jitters\n\nThe tumble in global stocks has prompted a flight to safety, with US government bonds rising and safe-haven currencies surging.\n\nDeepSeek, which overtook rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application on Apple\u2019s App Store in the UK and US, says it uses lower-cost chips. This challenges a widespread bet in markets that AI will drive huge expenditure with chipmakers.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1pc, the S&P 500 dropped 1.8pc, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 3pc.\n\nNvidia, whose chips are the top choice for powering AI applications, dropped 15.5pc in line with industry peers Broadcom and Marvell Technology. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d, hit its highest level since Dec 20, surging 25pc today.\n\nRobert Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY, said: \u201cThe catalyst of a foreign competitor to US-led AI dominance begs other questions about trade and semiconductor chips and energy needs. The markets are unsettled, and volatility is higher after last week\u2019s strong returns.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index was little changed, but the Stoxx Europe 600 technology index fell 3pc, its biggest one-day drop since mid-October. MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe fell 1.25pc, while the FTSE 100 was flat.\n\nUS Treasury yields tumbled to multi-week lows today, tracking steep declines in equities, as investors sought the safety of government bonds. The benchmark US 10-year yield dropped 4.546pc from 4.594pc late on Friday.\n\nThat pushed the dollar lower, with safe-haven currencies, including the \u00a0the yen and Swiss franc, as the main beneficiaries.Some investors have switched from stocks to bonds - Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\n04:33 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek struggles under \u2018malicious attacks\u2019\n\nChinese startup DeepSeek is struggling to keep up with demand from new users this afternoon.\n\nIts website says: \u201cDue to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek\u2019s services, registration may be busy. Please wait and try again. Registered users can log in normally. Thank you for your understanding and support.\u201d\n\nEarlier it was hit by outages on its website. Its status page said the company had resolved issues relating to its application programming interface and users\u2019 inability to log in to the website.\n\nThe outages on Monday coincided with its sky-rocketing popularity.Deepseek said it had been hit by \u2018large-scale malicious attacks\u2019 - Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg\n\n04:27 PM GMT\n\nChinese breakthrough gives hope to Europe, claims academic\n\nEurope\u2019s tech startups should be encouraged by the success of DeepSeek, a Barcelona-based business school professor has said.\n\nSampsa Samila, director of an AI programme at IESE Business School, said: \u201cDeepSeek has reset expectations on the capital intensity of large language models and shows that the market is in fact rather competitive and not simply dominated by a small number of very large companies.\n\n\u201cIt also demonstrates that better thinking can beat vast amounts of money, which should give hope to AI startups in Europe, where we have plenty of human capital but do not have the tens of billions to invest in training LLMs that we see in the US.\u201d\n\n04:24 PM GMT\n\nUS stock markets starting to change behaviour, says abrdn\n\nInvestors in US stocks are starting to focus more closely on profit growth rather than valuations, a leading investment manager has said.\n\nJamie Mills O\u2019Brien, investment director at abrdn, said: \u201cJitters in the tech market reinforce our view that investors should not be confining themselves only to the so-called Manificent Seven when looking for growth...\n\n\u201cWe are also starting to see signs of a market behaving slightly differently, with earnings growth - rather than [price to earnings] multiple expansion - becoming a more important arbiter of equity returns.\n\n\u201cHistorically when you hit the peak of a hiking cycle, market focus turns to earnings growth. And that is what we are seeing again \u2013 earnings, not multiples, are driving relative performance in 2024 than they have done over the last couple of years.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEmerging markets and China are set to deliver earnings growth over and above the US market. We think that might be significant, in particular given the valuation discrepancy we are seeing.\u201d\n\n04:15 PM GMT\n\nChinese AI could boost US tech giants, says analyst\n\nWhile Nvidia has plunged today, two of the Magnificent 7 tech stocks have actually risen.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said: \u201cToday\u2019s sell off could be an overreaction. If AI can run on less advanced chips, then it opens the door to stronger growth over a shorter time frame.\n\n\u201cThis may be bad news for AI\u2019s hardware producers like Nvidia, but surely it is good news for the hyper-scalers, like Microsoft, Meta and the cloud companies? This is reflected in the performance of the Magnificent 7 at the start of this week.\u201d\n\nNvidia dropped 13.6pc, Amazon is down 1pc, Microsoft is down 3.5pc, Alphabet dropped 2.5pc, Tesla lost 1pc, Apple rose 2.6pc, Meta rose 2pc.\n\n04:10 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek surges to top of Apple\u2019s App Store\n\nChinese AI app DeepSeek is now leading the list of most popular downloads on the iPhone\u2019s App store in the UK and the US.\n\nAmerican rival ChatGPT is currently in second place.\n\nBloomberg reported that computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee told the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong this month: \u201cThe US is great at research and innovation and especially breakthrough, but China is better at engineering. In this day and age, when you have limited compute power and money, you learn how to build things very efficiently.\u201dDeepSeek has shot to top of the App Store and given Wall Street a fright - Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg\n\n03:44 PM GMT\n\nSell-off is \u2018overblown\u2019, says analyst\n\nDan Ives, a Wall Street analyst at Wedbush Securities, insists the sell-off is overblown.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo US Global 2000 [company] is going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\n\n\u201cLaunching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing ... launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.\u201d\n\n03:40 PM GMT\n\nNothing lasts forever - is this AI\u2019s Amstrad moment?\n\nMost tech investors will be nursing their losses today. James Baxter-Derrington writes:\n\nWhile DeepSeek has disrupted what\u2019s already happening in the space, it remains to be seen if it can lead.\n\nRead on as James asks: is now the time to buy up cheap tech firms?Amstrad was once a major computer brand - Phil Coburn\n\n03:31 PM GMT\n\nAI \u2018game has changed\u2019 after DeepSeek launch, says academic\n\nProf Michael Woolridge, an AI expert at Oxford University, said DeepSeek\u2019s model challenges the notion that big US AI companies had a \u201cmoat\u201d which would be hard for other companies to crack.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeepSeek challenges that wisdom, being just as capable as the flagship US models, at a fraction of the scale.\n\n\u201cIf the claims are proved to hold up in the weeks ahead, then this will shape up to be a major challenge to the big players.\n\n\u201cAnd as a side effect, it will also make this technology massively more available than it was previously \u2013 admitting a whole range of new actors into the space (which will worry governments, who are already worried about the power that AI puts in the hands of unscrupulous actors).\n\n\u201cAnd it rather starkly demonstrates that China is very much keeping pace with the US in large-scale AI. I would want to see more evidence to support the claims, but if they do hold up, then the game just changed: scale isn\u2019t everything after all.\u201d\n\nThanks for following today\u2019s updates so far. My colleague Alex Singleton is stepping up now to keep you informed on what\u2019s happening with the AI tech sell-off.\n\n03:18 PM GMT\n\nChinese AI has sparked a $1 trillion panic \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t care about free speech\n\nHave there been human rights abuses in Xinjiang? Ask ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, and you\u2019ll receive an unambiguous yes.\n\nPut the same question to DeepSeek, a Chinese chatbot, and the answer is very different. \u201cAllegations of human rights abuses are unfounded and politically motivated,\u201d it says.\n\nIts response is not unusual: chatbots are heavily muzzled in China, where AI companies are required to instill the \u201csocialist values\u201d of the Communist Party and are regularly tested by Beijing\u2019s censors.\n\nRead how DeepSeek is sending shockwaves through Wall Street \u2013 and the West.DeepSeek\u2019s answers to various questions about China and its policies\n\n03:09 PM GMT\n\nNvidia suffers biggest rout in stock market history over China AI threat\n\nNvidia has suffered the largest stock market rout in history at the opening bell on Wall Street.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable company plunged 13pc as trading began in New York today, wiping more than $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off its valuation.\n\nIt still leaves the AI chip maker\u2019s market capitalisation at $3.1 trillion (\u00a32.5 trillion) as doubts emerge about US dominance of the nascent industry.\n\nThe fall in its value today eclipsed the previous record, a 9pc drop in September that wiped out about $279bn in value, according to Bloomberg.\n\n02:47 PM GMT\n\nMicrosoft suffers $119bn blow amid China AI fears\n\nStocks linked to the boom in AI have suffered steep losses at the start of trading on Wall Street over concerns that China will disrupt America\u2019s grip on the burgeoning industry.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested close to $14bn into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, has fallen 3.5pc, knocking more than $119bn (\u00a395bn) off its valuation.\n\nChip maker Advanced Micro Devices was down 4.8pc while Micron was down 8.9pc.\n\nDell fell 7pc and Super Micro Computer dropped 8.8pc.More than $119bn has been wiped off the value of Microsoft, led by Satya Nadella - Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg\n\n02:38 PM GMT\n\nUS stocks plunge over China\u2019s AI threat\n\nUS stock markets have plunged at their sharpest pace in five months after a China AI start-up unveiled a new chatbot which threatens to match its major global competitors at a lower cost.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index on Wall Street plummeted by 3.6pc at the opening bell\u00a0to 19,234.042 - its biggest fall since September - as DeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot triggered market turmoil.\n\nAI-focused shares in the US and Europe have suffered a $1 trillion (\u00a3799bn) rout after the China app soared to the top of the Apple Store\u2019s download charts.\n\nChip making giant Nvidia was down 13pc, wiping nearly $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off the value of the world\u2019s dominant supplier of AI hardware and software.

Otherwise, the rally has been impressively resilient against the higher long-term borrowing costs of recent weeks.\n\n\u201cAnd economic growth itself remains robust, with no sign yet of the negative data surprises that preceded the turmoil last summer.\u201d\n\n01:06 PM GMT\n\nUK stocks shielded from tech sell-off\n\nThe FTSE 100 has been insulated from the rapid sell-off in tech stocks after it hit a record high at the end of last week.\n\nBritain\u2019s flagship index was down 0.2pc to its lowest in a week but the losses were miniscule compared to the 3.9pc drop that the Nasdaq is on track to make at the opening bell.\n\nThe midcap FTSE 250 was down 0.6pc as it was dragged lower by its technology stocks, which have been hit by the rising popularity of Chinese AI app DeepSeek, which has raised questions about lofty valuations of tech giants on Wall Street.\n\nSusannah Streeter of Hargreaves Lansdown added: \u201cThe make up of the FTSE 100 also offers resilience in an uncertain world, with pharma, consumer staples, and utility stocks offering the prospect of stable returns whatever the economic weather.\u201d\n\n12:40 PM GMT\n\nWall Street fear gauge rises amid tech sell-off\n\nWall Street\u2019s so-called \u201cfear gauge\u201d has moved higher amid a sharp sell-off in tech stocks.\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index has hit its highest level so far this year, has risen more than six points to 21.38.\n\nDavid Morrison of Trade Nation said: \u201cInvestors have been forced to reconsider the outlook for capital expenditure and valuations given the threat of discount Chinese AI models.\n\n\u201cThese appear to be as good, if not better, than US versions.\u201d\n\n12:10 PM GMT\n\nTech sell-off eases government borrowing costs\n\nTreasury borrowing costs have fallen to their lowest level since the turn of the year as the sharp sell-off in tech stocks pushed investors towards safe haven assets.\n\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts - a benchmark of government borrowing costs - has fall seven basis points today to 4.56pc as money moved out of tech companies and into the relative stability of sovereign-backed bonds.\n\nGovernment bonds are considered a safe haven because the returns - the yield - are guaranteed by the state. The yield falls when there is greater demand as the government does not need to promise higher returns to attract buyers for its debt.\n\nThe fall in borrowing costs has wiped out the spike in yields earlier this month which triggered doubts about Rachel Reeves\u2019s ability to meet her fiscal rules. It had threatened to wipe out her \u00a310bn of fiscal headroom, which had been described by economists as \u201crazor thin\u201d.\n\nThe yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds plunged by 11 basis points to 4.5pc, its lowest level this year.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid said the drop in borrowing costs \u201cshows how crucial a handful of US stocks are to global macro\u201d.\n\nPointing to the 14pc plunge in Nvidia shares, he said: \u201cThis is a company that has gone from relative earnings obscurity to one of the most profitable in the world inside two years and the largest company in the world as of Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the AI industry is embryonic. And it\u2019s almost impossible to know how it will develop or what competition current winners might face even if you fully believe in its potential to drive future productivity.\n\n\u201cThe stratospheric rise of DeepSeek reminds us of this.\u201dChancellor Rachel Reeves has come under pressure this year after a surge in government bond yields wiped out her fiscal headroom left in the Budget - REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\n11:47 AM GMT\n\nNvidia down 12pc in premarket trading\n\nIt is becoming harder to keep track of how fast investors are dumping risky assets linked to the boom in artificial intelligence today.\n\nNvidia, the chip maker that has become the darling of the sector, has plunged 12pc in premarket trading.\n\nOther chipmakers such as AMD and Micron Technology fell 5.3pc and 8.4pc, respectively.\n\nMicrosoft, which has backed ChatGPT maker OpenAI, is down 5.9pc\n\nAI server makers Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer slid 9.3pc and 10.9pc ahead of the opening bell in New York.Nvidia co-founder and chief executive Jensen Huang is preparing for about $400bn to be wiped off the value of his company - An Rong Xu/Bloomberg\n\n11:34 AM GMT\n\nDeepSeek pours cold water on AI \u2018scaling laws\u2019\n\nThe artificial intelligence market boom of the last two years has been built on the idea that building increasingly advanced systems will require companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google to spend unprecedented sums on computer hardware such as Nvidia microchips and huge data centres.\n\n\u201cScaling laws\u201d - the idea that smarter AI will require more data and more spending - have become gospel in Silicon Valley.\n\nIt had made Nvidia the world\u2019s most valuable company and created a halo effect around companies such as ASML, whose machines make the microchips.\n\nThe arrival of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has appeared to pour cold water on that theory.\n\nThe company claims that it cost just $5.6m to train its latest V3 model, which offers similar performance to the best OpenAI and Google AI systems.\n\nA new model released last week, R1, claims to contain so-called \u201creasoning\u201d capabilities which experts see as a step towards human-level AI.\n\nIf the techniques DeepSeek used to develop its models spread into the rest of the AI world, it could lead to a sharp slowdown in spending on Nvidia chips and other hardware, which have been the picks and shovels of the current AI gold rush.\n\nAs Mizuho\u2019s Jordan Rochester put it on Monday:\u00a0\u201cIt fundamentally breaks the AI Capex narrative if true.\u201d\n\n11:14 AM GMT\n\nTech rout deepens on Wall Street\n\nThe Nasdaq has plummeted further ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street as the DeepSeek tech rout deepens.\n\nThe tech-focused index was down more than 5pc in premarket trading, while S&P 500 \u201cfutures\u201d contracts were down 3pc.\n\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \u201cDeepSeek\u2019s success will serve to intensify the US/China AI war, particularly following the recent announcement of the Stargate project in the US.\n\n\u201cIt also provides a wake up call and somewhat of a question mark on how much needs to be spent in order to build a model, and whether quite the level of CapEx we have been seeing is really required.\n\n\u201cHowever, bringing the price of model training down is no bad thing as it will help to lower the entry point and this price elasticity could help drive usage and volume.\u201d\n\n11:04 AM GMT\n\nTrue value of AI lies in data, says Salesforce boss\n\nChina chatbot DeepSeek is proving that the true value of AI is not in the user experience but in the data used to enhance it, the boss of US cloud software company Salesforce has said.\n\nDeepSeek said it had taken just two months and less than $6m (\u00a34.8m) to build a model more advanced than many of its Western competitors.\n\n10:43 AM GMT\n\nTech stocks on track for $1 trillion wipe-out\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot has triggered market turmoil that could wipe more than $1 trillion (\u00a3799bn) off technology companies at the opening bell in New York later.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 has tumbled 3.4pc in premarket trading, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell 2pc.\n\nIn Europe, tech stocks led market losses, with shares of chip equipment maker ASML down 11pc.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 and Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 technology companies are together on track to take a hit of more than $1 trillion to their market valuations if the losses are confirmed at the opening bell on Wall Street this afternoon.\n\n10:34 AM GMT\n\nChina\u2019s lightning AI success should frighten Wall Street \u2013 and Trump\n\nChina has astonished the artificial intelligence community with a new model that runs at the fraction of the cost of American \u201cfrontier\u201d models, writes Andrew Orlowski.\n\nDeepSeek is almost as good too and it has published the source code, so everyone can download it and run it. Not for the first time, China appears to have copied someone else\u2019s product, and can sell a much cheaper version.\n\nThe high profile venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek\u2019s model \u201cthe most amazing and impressive breakthrough I\u2019ve ever seen, and\u2026 a profound gift to the world\u201d.\n\nThe New York Times quoted a Californian professor and entrepreneur saying that \u201cthe center of gravity of the open source community has been moving to China\u201d, which he thought was \u201ca huge worry\u201d.\n\nRead how Western hopes of winning the next technological revolution are being dashed.Donald Trump\u2019s plans for a $500bn AI investment programme led by prominent industry figures including Sam Altman now look like a riskier bet - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\n10:11 AM GMT\n\nNvidia down 10pc as DeepSeek to \u2018put the cat among the pigeons\u2019\n\nAI poster child Nvidia dropped more than 10pc in premarket trading after the launch of DeepSeek\u2019s AI Assistant.\n\nOther chipmakers such as AMD and Micron Technology fell 4.5pc and 7.4pc, respectively.\n\nAI server makers Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer slid 7.8pc and 9.6pc ahead of the opening bell in New York.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: \u201cIt is far too early to describe DeepSeek as an existential threat to US-based AI solutions.\n\n\u201cIt will almost certainly put the cat among the pigeons as investors scramble to assess the potential damage it could have on a burgeoning industry which has powered much of the gain seen in the main indices over the past couple of years.\u201d\n\n09:45 AM GMT\n\nMicrosoft boss dismisses fears over China AI chatbot\n\nThe boss of Microsoft appeared to play down concerns about the emergence of China AI start-up DeepSeek, which has sparked a sell-off in US tech shares.\n\nSatya Nadella said that as AI \u201cgets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket\u201d.\n\nHe pointed to the economic theory known as Jevons paradox, which states that when technological progress improves efficiency, it actually leads to greater consumption of that resource, not less.\n\nUsers have been wowed by the roll-out of DeepSeek, a free assistant that its developers say uses lower-cost chips and less data.\n\nMicrosoft shares are down more than 4pc in premarket trading in New York amid suggestions that valuations of US tech stocks have become inflated as investors race to capitalise on the boom in AI.\n\n09:30 AM GMT\n\nDeepSeek triggers tech stock sell-off\n\nGlobal markets have been rocked by the unveiling of DeepSeek\u2019s new chatbot.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 tumbled as much as 3.2pc in premarket trading, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell 1.9pc.\n\nIn Europe, tech stocks led market losses, with shares of chip equipment maker ASML down more than 8pc.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 was down 0.7pc.
