(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple faces a 'fork in the road year,' analysts say\nNews Content: Photo: Cheng Xin (Getty Images)\n\nAs Apple (AAPL) stock takes a tumble to kick off 2025, analysts at Wedbush don\u2019t see cause for concern.\n\n\u201cWe believe the panic and bear frenzy around Apple is way overdone\u201d heading into next week\u2019s December earnings report, analysts led by Dan Ives said in a research note Wednesday.\n\nSo far this year, shares of the Cupertino, California-based company are down more than 8% as expectations around sales for the 2025 fiscal year fall short. Last week, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance.\n\nShares of Apple were up 0.25% Wednesday morning, after closing at $223.83 Tuesday.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies also said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March.\n\nThis slide in stock price caused chipmaker Nvidia to overtake Apple as the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.\n\nBut analysts at Wedbush said that overall unit declines in China are \u201cmanageable,\u201d and that investors will get a better understanding of Apple\u2019s China turnaround once it announces its regional AI partner, which will likely be Baidu (BIDU). Tencent (TCEHY) and ByteDance are also in the running, Ives said.\n\nAs a result, the securities firm maintained its \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and $325 price target\n\n\u201cWith Apple Intelligence being rolled out in a phased strategy the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle is the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world\u2019s population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nAlthough Jefferies and others have raised concerns about Apple\u2019s AI strategy, which came late in the game compared with competitors and is being rolled out in phases through the tech giant\u2019s latest models, Ives believes 2025 will be a \u201cfork in the road year\u201d for Apple.\n\n\u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither will Apple\u2019s AI strategy,\u201d Ives said. \u201cbut the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.\u201d\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

Wedbush maintains a bullish outlook, citing manageable China unit declines, an upcoming AI partnership, and the long-term potential of Apple Intelligence.  They reiterate an outperform rating and a $325 price target. Conversely, Jefferies expresses concern over weak iPhone sales due to limited hardware upgrades and cautiousness regarding the iPhone SE 4 demand.  The current stock price is below the Wedbush target, suggesting potential upside. However, the negative sentiment from Jefferies and the recent stock price decline (over 8% YTD) introduce downside risk.  Considering both bullish and bearish perspectives, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy and the overall market sentiment.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple faces a 'fork in the road year,' analysts say\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
