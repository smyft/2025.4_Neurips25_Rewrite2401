However, as a major player in the tech industry, any significant changes in the regulatory environment or the competitive landscape could have indirect effects on Apple. A ban on TikTok might lead to increased scrutiny of other foreign-owned apps and potentially impact Apple's App Store policies or revenue. Nevertheless, the direct impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight bias towards a neutral or slight positive movement due to the potential for increased scrutiny on competitors and the broader tech industry.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"TikTok Ban at the Supreme Court: Here\u2019s What to Know\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
