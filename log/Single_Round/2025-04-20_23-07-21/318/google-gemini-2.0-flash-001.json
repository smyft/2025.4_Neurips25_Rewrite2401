The potential ban could indirectly benefit Apple in a few ways: 1) Increased usage of alternative video platforms on iOS devices, potentially boosting app store revenue. 2) Reduced competition for user attention, potentially leading to increased engagement with other Apple services. However, the impact is likely to be marginal. The news doesn't directly impact Apple's core business (hardware sales, subscriptions). Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be small. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise due to the potential, albeit small, positive impact on app store revenue and user engagement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"TikTok Ban at the Supreme Court: Here\u2019s What to Know\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
