(AAPL) as one of those stocks. However, the mere association with Warren Buffett, known for his successful investment strategies, could have a positive impact on investor sentiment. Given that Apple is a well-established and widely followed stock, any indirect positive mention or association can potentially influence its stock price. However, without direct confirmation that AAPL is one of the stocks, the impact is likely to be muted. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.20\n}\n```"
