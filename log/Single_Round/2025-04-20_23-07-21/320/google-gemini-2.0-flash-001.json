Buffett's investment decisions are widely respected and followed, so his significant investment in a company often signals strong confidence in its long-term prospects. This can lead to increased investor interest and buying pressure, potentially driving the stock price up. However, the news is somewhat vague as it doesn't explicitly confirm Apple's inclusion, and the market may have already priced in Buffett's existing stake. Therefore, the probability of a significant price surge is moderate, while the probability of a fall is lower, assuming no other negative news emerges.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"80% of Warren Buffett's $297 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 9 Unstoppable Stocks in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
