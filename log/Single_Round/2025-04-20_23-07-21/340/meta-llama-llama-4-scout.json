This suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock in the short term, driven by concerns over iPhone sales in China. The UBS analysts' decision to slash their iPhone sales estimates further below Wall Street's consensus due to weakness in China adds to the negative sentiment. Given this information, it is reasonable to conclude that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Stock Falls on Report of China iPhone Discounts. \u2018Winter Is Here,\u2019 Analyst Says.\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}\n```"
