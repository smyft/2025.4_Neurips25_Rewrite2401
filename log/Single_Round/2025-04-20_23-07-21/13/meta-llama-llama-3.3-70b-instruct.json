This statement is a response to criticism from Trump, who has been vocal about the EU's antitrust enforcement against US businesses. Given that the article does not contain any direct negative or positive news about Apple's financial performance or products, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, the fact that the EU is reaffirming its commitment to antitrust enforcement could be seen as a slightly negative factor for big tech companies, including Apple, as it may indicate a tougher regulatory environment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of the stock price falling.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}"
