However, the content does not specifically mention Apple Inc. or any direct actions against it. The EU's antitrust enforcement is a regulatory issue that could affect Apple, but the news does not provide a clear negative or positive impact on the company. Given the lack of direct reference to Apple and the general nature of the statement, the news is likely to have a neutral to slightly negative impact due to the ongoing regulatory scrutiny faced by big tech companies. However, the probabilities of stock price rise or fall are estimated based on the assumption that the market already factors in some level of regulatory risk.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"EU\u2019s Big Tech Antitrust Fines \u2018Not a Tax\u2019, Competition Chief Ribera Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
