While the headline doesn't directly mention Apple, the analysis needs to consider if Apple is perceived as one of these 'popular AI stocks' by investors. Apple has been investing heavily in AI, so it's plausible that some investors might categorize it as such. The impact will depend on the credibility and influence of the 'certain Wall Street analysts' mentioned. Without knowing who these analysts are and the specifics of their analysis, it's difficult to quantify the impact precisely. However, the negative sentiment expressed in the headline is likely to create some downward pressure on the stock. The probabilities are adjusted to reflect this uncertainty, with a higher probability of a fall than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple's overall financial health and diverse product portfolio provide some buffer against negative AI-specific sentiment.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}\n```"
