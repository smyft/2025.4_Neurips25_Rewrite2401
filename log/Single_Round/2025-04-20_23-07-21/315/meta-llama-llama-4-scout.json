However, Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not explicitly mentioned in the provided content as one of the stocks to sell. Given that the content does not directly mention Apple, the negative predictions for other AI stocks may not directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price rising or falling based on this news is relatively low. However, considering the general market sentiment that could be inferred from such analyst predictions, there might be a slight inclination towards a negative impact.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"2 Popular AI Stocks to Sell Before They Drop 24% and 66% in 2025, According to Certain Wall Street Analysts\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
