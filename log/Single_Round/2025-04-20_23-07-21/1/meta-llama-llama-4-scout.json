(AAPL), but the content of the news does not directly indicate a negative impact on Apple. The news seems to focus on the vulnerabilities of other companies, such as Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and others, that are part of the Mag 7. There is no clear indication that Apple's stock price will be directly affected in a negative way. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7. Here\u2019s What Happens Next.\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n\nIn this analysis, I considered that the news headline and content do not directly mention Apple as being negatively impacted. The mention of 'Mag 7' could imply a broader market impact, but without specific details on how Apple is involved or affected, I assume the impact on Apple's stock price might be neutral or mildly positive given the lack of direct negative information about the company. Therefore, the estimated probabilities reflect a cautiously optimistic view that the stock price might not be significantly negatively impacted and could potentially rise if investors interpret the news as not directly harmful to Apple."
