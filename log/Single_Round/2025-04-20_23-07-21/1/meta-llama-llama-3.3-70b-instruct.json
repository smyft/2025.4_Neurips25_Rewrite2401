However, it also states that Wall Street's concerns might be overblown, implying that the impact of this news might not be as significant as initially thought. Since Apple Inc. (AAPL) is not directly mentioned as one of the vulnerable companies, the news is likely to have an indirect or minimal impact on its stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is uncertain, but the fact that it does not directly implicate Apple suggests that the probabilities should be closer to equal, with a slight lean towards a rise if investors perceive Apple as less affected or potentially benefiting from the situation.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"DeepSeek Took a Bite Out of the Mag 7.
