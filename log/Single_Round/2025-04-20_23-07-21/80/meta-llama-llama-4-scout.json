This news does not provide any direct information about Apple Inc. (AAPL) or its financial performance. As a result, it is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price. The news is more related to general investment strategies rather than company-specific news. Therefore, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is low. Given the neutral nature of the news, I would assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising, assuming general market conditions remain stable, but overall, the impact is expected to be minimal.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Sector ETFs\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.52,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.48\n}\n```"
