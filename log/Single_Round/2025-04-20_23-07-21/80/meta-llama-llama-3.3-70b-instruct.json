The news discusses the general strategy of investing in sector ETFs for diversification and risk reduction, which is a neutral, generic investment advice not tied to any particular company's stock performance. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a direct impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news are estimated to be nearly equal, with a slight bias towards no change.
