(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Epic Games kicks off plan to add third-party games to own mobile store\nNews Content: (Reuters) - \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games said on Thursday it will add 19 third-party games to its own marketplace app on Google's Android globally and 16 games on Apple's iOS in the European Union.\n\nThe videogame company had launched its mobile game store in 2024, allowing it to avoid fees imposed by conventional app marketplaces such as Google's Play and Apple's App Store while making in-app purchases.\n\nEpic Games had also argued that users did not have much choice beyond the two popular app stores for downloading gaming applications, suppressing competition.\n\nIt will launch a program to offer free games on its mobile store, starting with titles such as \"Bloons TD 6\" and \"Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee\".\n\nThe company said it would temporarily cover core technology fees, the 0.50 euros ($0.5210) charged by Apple on every app after it crosses 1 million installs, for developers that participate in Epic's free-games program in Europe.\n\n\"We are opening up the Epic Games Store to mobile games from third parties, starting with a small catalog and expanding over time to a very big catalog,\" CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters.\n\n\"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores and different places, but to build a single cross-platform store.\"\n\nNorth Carolina-based Epic Games reached 29 million users for its mobile store by end-2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users.\n\nThe company also offers a computer graphics software, called \"Unreal Engine\", which is widely used by app developers to design and develop games.\n\nApple had approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe last year. Epic had faced off with Google and Apple over their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on app store payments.\n\nAfter getting banned for nearly four years, Epic's \"Fortnite\" returned on iPhones in the European Union and Android devices globally.\n\n($1 = 0.9598 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.
