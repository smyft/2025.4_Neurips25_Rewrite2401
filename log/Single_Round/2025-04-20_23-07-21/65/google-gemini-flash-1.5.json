The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are significant concerns for investors.  While Apple's earnings report could potentially offset this negative sentiment, the downgrade itself suggests a less optimistic outlook from a reputable analyst firm.  The probability of a price fall is therefore higher than a price rise in the short term, immediately following the news. However, it's important to note that Apple is a large, established company, and the market's reaction might be muted or even positive if the earnings report surpasses expectations.
