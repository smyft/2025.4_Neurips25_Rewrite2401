This is generally considered neutral news.  A 'largely in-line' prediction suggests no significant positive or negative surprises. While this might not cause a large price movement in either direction, the market's reaction will depend on other factors such as investor sentiment, overall market conditions, and any other concurrent news.  Given the lack of substantial positive or negative information, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively unchanged price, with slightly higher probability for a minor price fluctuation in either direction due to general market volatility.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Poised for Largely In-Line First-Quarter Revenue, Morgan Stanley Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
