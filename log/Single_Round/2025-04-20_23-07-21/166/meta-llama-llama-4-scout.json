This neutral expectation does not indicate a significant beat or miss of earnings, which could have led to a surge in stock price. However, it also does not indicate a significant miss, which could have led to a drop in stock price. As a result, the stock price is likely to experience a relatively stable or slightly positive reaction, given that the news is not negative and may even be slightly positive for investors who were worried about a potential miss.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Poised for Largely In-Line First-Quarter Revenue, Morgan Stanley Says\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.30\n}\n```\n\nNote that I've estimated the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.55 (or 55%) and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.30 (or 30%), based on the neutral to slightly positive tone of the news headline. The remaining 15% is the probability of the stock price remaining unchanged or experiencing a negligible reaction."
