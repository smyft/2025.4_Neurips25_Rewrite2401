(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\nNews Content: Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet. Apple\u2019s total revenue was $124.3 billion, rising almost 4% from the same quarter last year.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

However, the company's total revenue still saw a 4% increase from the same quarter last year. This mixed performance suggests that while the decline in iPhone sales might negatively impact investor sentiment, the overall revenue growth could mitigate the negative effects. Given this, the probability of the stock price falling due to the decline in iPhone sales is higher than the probability of it rising solely based on the revenue growth. However, since the decline in iPhone sales is only slight and the company's overall revenue is still growing, the impact on the stock price might not be significantly negative.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple iPhone Sales Shrink Slightly as Investors Await AI Payoff\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}"
