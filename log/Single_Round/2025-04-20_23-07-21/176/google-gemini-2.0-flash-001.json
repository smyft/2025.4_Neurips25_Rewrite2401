Regulatory scrutiny often creates uncertainty and can lead to potential fines or changes in business practices, which investors generally perceive negatively. While the full impact is unknown without the details of the probe, the initial reaction is likely to be slightly negative. The fact that the full article is behind a paywall limits the depth of analysis possible. However, given Apple's size and the fact that this is just a probe (not a definitive ruling), the impact is likely to be moderate. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
