Such investigations can lead to fines, changes in business practices, or increased scrutiny, which may create uncertainty among investors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising, as regulatory probes typically have a negative connotation in the market. However, Apple's strong brand and market position may mitigate some of the negative impact, leading to a lower probability of a significant drop.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Update: Apple, Alphabet's Google Face UK Probe Into Mobile Ecosystems, Operating Systems\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.7\n}"
