While some might interpret this as a negative, suggesting Apple is falling behind in the AI race,  it could also be viewed positively. Apple has a history of focusing on integrating AI subtly into its existing products rather than making it a major marketing point.  DeepSeek's validation of this approach suggests that Apple's strategy might be effective.  The massive AI spending by competitors like Meta carries significant risk;  Apple's more measured approach could be seen as fiscally responsible and less prone to large write-downs.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  A slight negative reaction is possible due to the prevailing narrative around the importance of large AI investments, but the overall effect is expected to be minimal. The probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of no significant change, and the probability of a price fall is even lower.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s Muted AI Spending Is Likely to Continue.
