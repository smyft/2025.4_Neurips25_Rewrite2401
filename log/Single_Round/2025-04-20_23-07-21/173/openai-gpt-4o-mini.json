This could be seen as a negative development for Apple, as it may impact their revenue model and control over the App Store. Regulatory pressures often lead to uncertainty in stock performance. However, the overall market sentiment and Apple's strong brand loyalty may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, while there is a significant chance of a stock price decline due to regulatory concerns, the strong fundamentals of Apple may also support a rise in stock price. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Market Chatter: Apple, Google, Smartphone Makers Pressed by India to Open Up App Stores\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.65\n}"
