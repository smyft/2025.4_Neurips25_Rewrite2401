The article mentions a recommendation to buy puts on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF to hedge against the downside, which is related to small caps, not directly to Apple. However, the fact that Apple's earnings are mentioned as something that investors may want to play suggests that there may be some uncertainty or volatility surrounding the stock. Given the lack of concrete information about Apple's performance, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are difficult to estimate. However, since the article does not contain any strongly negative information about Apple, the probability of the stock price falling might be slightly lower than the probability of it rising.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"How to use options to play small caps, Apple earnings\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
