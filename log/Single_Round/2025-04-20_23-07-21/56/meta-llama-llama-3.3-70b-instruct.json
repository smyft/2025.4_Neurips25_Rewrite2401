However, since the task is to analyze the news and estimate stock price movement probabilities for Apple Inc. (AAPL), we must consider the indirect implications or lack thereof. The news about Meta Platforms' sales and investments in AI and augmented reality does not directly relate to Apple's financials or operations. Therefore, without direct relevance, the impact on Apple's stock price should be minimal. However, in the tech industry, positive news about one major player can sometimes influence investor sentiment towards others, potentially leading to a slight, indirect positive effect. Given the indirect nature and lack of direct relevance, the probabilities should reflect a neutral stance with a slight lean towards a positive movement due to potential industry-wide sentiment boosts.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Platforms Sales Soar to Record, Bolstering Zuckerberg\u2019s AI Spending Spree\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
