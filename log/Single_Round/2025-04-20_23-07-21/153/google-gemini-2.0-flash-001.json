(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple Faces Challenges in 2025, but Q1 Earnings Likely to Beat Estimates\nNews Content: On January 30, Apple (AAPL, Financial) is set to post strongly ahead of the iPhone 16 on a fiscal first quarter of fiscal year 2025 earnings call. BofA analysts continue to see strong Q1 results but warn that the March quarter will be weak, with iPhone sales likely to decline to 49 million units versus the consensus of 52 million. Macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features are to blame for the decline.\n\nBofA cut its iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 to 229 million for 2025 and 246 million for 2026 from 262 million each. However, the bank is still bullish on the stock, noting Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency and its possible pending product launches, including the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. BofA says concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are overdone, given that it has cut prices and will receive potential government subsidies. Analysts adjust the price target for Apple to $253 from $256 as the company's new FY26 EPS forecast of $8.37 yields a 30x multiple.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

However, the medium-term outlook (March quarter and FY25/26 iPhone sales) is negative, potentially pulling the stock price down. BofA's continued bullish stance and price target adjustment offer some support. The key factors influencing the probabilities are: 1) Strong Q1 earnings beat expectation, 2) Weak iPhone sales forecast for the March quarter and beyond, 3) BofA's bullish outlook and price target, and 4) Potential positive catalysts like the new iPhone SE and government subsidies in China. Considering these factors, the positive Q1 earnings are likely to have a stronger immediate impact, but the negative forecasts will temper the rise. The bullish analyst sentiment provides a floor. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Faces Challenges in 2025, but Q1 Earnings Likely to Beat Estimates\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
