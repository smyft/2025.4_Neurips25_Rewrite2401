(AAPL)\nNews Headline: 3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\nNews Content: When Apple reports its fiscal first quarter results on Thursday, the stakes are particularly high. 1. At half of total revenue in fiscal 2024, iPhone sales are always paramount in Apple\u2019s financials. Wall Street analysts see only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales from a year before, so it may mean another year of low iPhone growth, like in fiscal 2022 through 2024.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

This low growth projection, combined with iPhone sales being a significant portion of Apple's revenue, could lead to a neutral or negative market reaction. Historically, when growth expectations are low, and actual results do not exceed these modest projections, stock prices tend to react negatively. However, the market has already priced in these expectations to some extent, and if Apple's earnings report meets or slightly exceeds these modest expectations, the stock price might see a less severe decline or even a slight rise due to relief. Given these considerations, the probability of the stock price rising seems lower than the probability of it falling, but still, there is a chance for a positive surprise if Apple's ecosystem, services, or other product lines show significant growth.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"3 Things to Look for in Apple\u2019s Earnings\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
