It suggests the analyst believes the stock is likely to perform worse than the market average. This can lead to increased selling pressure as investors react to the downgrade. However, Apple is a large, well-established company with a strong track record. A single analyst's rating, even a rare one, may not have a drastic long-term impact. The market's reaction will also depend on the analyst's rationale for the downgrade and the overall market sentiment. Given Apple's resilience, the probability of a significant price drop is tempered, but the negative sentiment makes a price decrease more likely than an increase in the short term.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst.
