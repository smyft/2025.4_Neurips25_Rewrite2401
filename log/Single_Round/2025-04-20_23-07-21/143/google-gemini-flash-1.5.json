While a single analyst downgrade doesn't guarantee a price drop, it does introduce negative sentiment into the market.  Apple is a large-cap, relatively stable company, so the impact might be less dramatic than for a smaller, more volatile company. However, the news could trigger some selling pressure from investors who are already hesitant or looking for reasons to take profits.  The probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, but the magnitude of the movement is likely to be relatively small given Apple's overall market position and the fact that it's just one analyst's opinion.  The probabilities are estimates and do not account for other market factors that could influence Apple's stock price.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst.
