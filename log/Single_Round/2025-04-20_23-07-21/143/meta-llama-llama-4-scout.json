(AAPL) received a rare underperform rating from a Wall Street analyst, which typically implies a negative outlook on the stock's future performance. Such ratings can influence investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in stock price as investors may interpret this as a signal to sell or avoid buying the stock. Given the generally positive sentiment around Apple and the rarity of underperform ratings, the immediate effect is likely to be negative. However, the long-term impact depends on various factors including the company's fundamentals, market conditions, and how investors perceive the analyst's rating. Based on this news, the probability of the stock price rising is lower compared to the probability of it falling.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst.
