(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\nNews Content: (Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity launched an agent-based assistant for Android devices on Thursday as it looks to take on larger rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and incumbent assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.\n\nThe Nvidia and Jeff Bezos-backed company said the tool, known as Perplexity Assistant, can book dinner reservations, hail rides on apps and set reminders, among other actions. It is available in 15 languages on Google's Play Store.\n\n\"We'd love to make it available on iOS, and if Apple gives us the right permissions, we'll make it happen,\" a spokesperson for Perplexity said.\n\nOpenAI rolled out a similar tool, called Tasks, to ChatGPT Team and Pro subscribers last week on the web platform.\n\nTech giants Amazon and Apple have also been developing more advanced versions of their assistants.\n\nLast year, Apple incorporated Apple Intelligence into its voice assistant, Siri, and in a partnership with OpenAI, the iPhone maker also introduced the use of ChatGPT, with user permission. Meanwhile, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, said in December that a refreshed version of their voice assistant, Alexa, is on the horizon and expected to launch in the \"coming months.\"\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While Perplexity explicitly mentions its desire to launch on iOS,  the article highlights advancements from competitors like Amazon and OpenAI, increasing the competitive pressure on Apple's AI offerings.  However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Apple is a massive company with diverse revenue streams; the emergence of a new competitor in the AI assistant market is unlikely to significantly affect its overall financial performance in the short term.  The news is more relevant to the competitive landscape of the AI assistant market than to Apple's core business and financial health. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction is low.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Perplexity debuts AI assistant on Android to challenge Alexa, ChatGPT\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.1,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.1\n}\n```\n"
