While it acknowledges a potential lack of innovation, as suggested by Mark Zuckerberg, it also argues that this shouldn't significantly impact investors. This suggests that Apple's current business model, brand loyalty, and existing product ecosystem are strong enough to sustain its performance even without groundbreaking innovation. The 'shouldn't matter to investors' part of the headline is crucial. It implies that the market might not react negatively to the perceived lack of innovation, potentially because Apple's financial performance remains robust. However, the initial statement about innovation could create some uncertainty. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise, assuming the market focuses on the latter part of the headline and Apple's overall financial strength.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Mark Zuckerberg May Be Right About Apple's Lack of Innovation.
