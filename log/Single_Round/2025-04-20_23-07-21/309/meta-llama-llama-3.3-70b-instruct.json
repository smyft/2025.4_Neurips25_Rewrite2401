This implies that Apple's products, particularly iPhones, are in high demand and that users are willing to pay a premium for additional storage. The article does not contain any negative information about the company or its products, and the tone is neutral/informative. Therefore, it is unlikely to have a significant negative impact on the stock price. However, the article does not provide any groundbreaking or exceptionally positive information that would likely cause a significant increase in the stock price. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively close to each other.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Your iPhone Storage Is Full Again.
