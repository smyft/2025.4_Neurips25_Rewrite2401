(AAPL)\nNews Headline: India Urges Apple, Google to Host Government App Suite Amid Resistance\nNews Content: The Indian government has requested Apple (AAPL, Financials) and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores to enhance public access to government services, Bloomberg News reported, citing individuals familiar with the matter.\n\nMeeting with officials from Apple, Google, and other smartphone companies last month, India's technology minister proposed direct user access to the government-backed software suite. Officials recommended that the applications be pre-installed on Indian-sold handsets and made accessible for download free from warnings including \"untrusted source.\"\n\nGoogle, whose Android operating system runs over 90% of India's around 700 million cellphones, is apparently turning down the demand. Apple is also reported to be reluctant to cooperate. The government has said it could use legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance.\n\nBelieving the GOV.in app suite might increase utilization if combined into a single package in the app stores, the ministry seeks to spread public-welfare services via technology. Right now, Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store each include separate apps.\n\nApple also made a similar action in 2021 in Russia, giving consumers the choice to install government-recommended applications to follow local rules.\n\nTo protect the mobile ecosystem, Google has apparently shown a readiness to work with Indian authorities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments\n\nNow give your prediction about the probability of the stock price of the relevant company rising or falling.

While this could potentially increase Apple's market share in India in the long term, the immediate impact is likely to be minimal. Apple's reluctance to comply, and the potential for legal action, introduces uncertainty.  However, Apple's previous similar action in Russia suggests a willingness to comply with government regulations, albeit potentially reluctantly. The overall impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher probability of a minor negative impact due to the potential for regulatory friction and the associated costs and complexities of compliance.  The news is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, and the market may already have priced in similar regulatory risks in other countries.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"India Urges Apple, Google to Host Government App Suite Amid Resistance\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.3,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```\n"
