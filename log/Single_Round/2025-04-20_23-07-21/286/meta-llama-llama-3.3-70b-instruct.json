However, as a major technology company, Apple's stock price might be indirectly affected by the overall trend of investment in AI stocks. Since the news does not provide any negative information about Apple, and Warren Buffett's investments are often seen as a positive indicator, the probability of the stock price rising might be slightly higher than the probability of it falling.
