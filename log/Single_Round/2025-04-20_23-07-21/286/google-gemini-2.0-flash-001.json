While the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple, the context implies that Apple is likely one of these AI stocks, or at least benefits from the overall positive sentiment towards AI. Warren Buffett's investment decisions are highly regarded, and his backing of a company often leads to increased investor confidence. This increased confidence typically translates to higher demand for the stock, driving the price up. However, the headline is somewhat vague and doesn't explicitly confirm Apple's involvement. There's also the possibility that the market has already priced in this information, or that investors might interpret the news as Berkshire Hathaway diversifying away from other sectors, which could have a slightly negative impact. Given the positive association with Buffett and AI, the probability of a rise is higher, but the lack of explicit confirmation and potential for alternative interpretations temper the enthusiasm.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett's Biggest Artificial Intelligence Bets in 2025: 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 Billion Stock Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
