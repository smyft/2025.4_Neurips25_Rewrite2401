This news is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price.  Buffett's investment choices in other companies do not directly impact Apple's performance or valuation. There is no direct relationship stated or implied between Buffett's AI investments and Apple's prospects. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price moving significantly up or down due to this news is very low. Any price movement would likely be due to other market factors or Apple-specific news, not this particular headline.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett's Biggest Artificial Intelligence Bets in 2025: 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 Billion Stock Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.51,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.49\n}\n```\n"
