(AAPL). Buffett's investment decisions are highly regarded in the financial markets, and his endorsement of AI stocks, including Apple, could be perceived as a strong vote of confidence in the company's future growth prospects in the AI sector. This could lead to increased investor interest and positive sentiment, potentially driving the stock price higher. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's AI initiatives or financial performance, so the impact may be somewhat limited. The probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling due to the positive association with Buffett's investment strategy.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett's Biggest Artificial Intelligence Bets in 2025: 24.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's $292 Billion Stock Portfolio Is in These 2 AI Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.65,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.35\n}\n```"
