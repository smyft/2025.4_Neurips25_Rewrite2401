We only know that China has made a memory breakthrough and that Apple is using US-made chips.  Without knowing the specifics of either development (e.g., the significance of China's breakthrough, the scale of Apple's US chip adoption, the impact on Apple's supply chain, cost, or performance), it's impossible to accurately assess the impact on Apple's stock price.  A memory breakthrough in China could be positive or negative for Apple, depending on whether it's a competitor or a potential supplier. Similarly, using US-made chips could increase costs or improve security and reduce reliance on foreign suppliers.
