However, without the full article content, it's difficult to assess the magnitude of each event's impact. Given the limited information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral or slightly negative impact, as the China news could have broader implications. The lack of access to the full article significantly limits the accuracy of this assessment.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"China\u2019s memory breakthrough and Apple\u2019s first US chips\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
