This implies that the current boost to the stock price from the DeepSeek news may not be sustainable in the long term. However, the fact that the stock is getting a boost from the news indicates some level of optimism about the company's future prospects. Given this mixed assessment, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable, but still significant due to the general positive sentiment around AI and technology advancements.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}"
