However, the stock is getting a boost from the DeepSeek news, indicating some positive sentiment. The article also mentions that AI isn't yet driving a rush to upgrade iPhones, which could be seen as a neutral or slightly negative factor for Apple's short-term stock performance. Overall, the mixed implications of the news lead to a cautious outlook, with a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to the tempered expectations around AI's impact on iPhone upgrades and the company's AI progress.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
