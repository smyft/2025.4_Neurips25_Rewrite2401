This suggests that the current positive momentum is not directly linked to Apple's AI strategy.  The absence of a significant AI-driven upgrade cycle implies a potential for limited near-term stock price increases directly attributable to AI.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, primarily driven by factors outside the AI narrative.  The probability of a price fall is also relatively low, as the news doesn't present any negative developments.  The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a greater influence on the stock price than this specific news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple\u2019s AI Moment Is Still a Ways Off\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.2\n}\n```\n"
