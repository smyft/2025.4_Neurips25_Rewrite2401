While this is significant market news, it has very little direct impact on Apple's stock price.  The news does not mention Apple, nor does it suggest any changes in Apple's business or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect, primarily influenced by broader market sentiment towards AI and tech stocks.  Any price movement would be more likely due to other factors affecting Apple, such as product releases, earnings reports, or overall market trends, rather than this specific news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Warren Buffett Has $74 Billion of Berkshire Hathaway's $301 Billion Portfolio Tied Up in 2 Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.51,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.49\n}\n```\n"
