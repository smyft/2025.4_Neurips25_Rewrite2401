While Apple is a component of VTI, the article's focus is on the ETF itself and how to invest in it. This news is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall are close to equal, reflecting the general market sentiment rather than a specific Apple-related event. There might be a very slight positive impact if increased investment in VTI leads to more buying of Apple shares as part of the ETF's holdings, but this effect is likely minimal.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"How to Invest in Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.51,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.49\n}\n```"
