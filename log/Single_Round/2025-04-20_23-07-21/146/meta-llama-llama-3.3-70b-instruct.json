Although the article does not specifically mention Apple Inc. (AAPL), it does compare FANG stocks (which include Apple) to the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. The article also mentions the performance of other markets and assets, such as bitcoin and gold. Given the positive market sentiment and the fact that Apple is a component of the FANG stocks, it is likely that Apple's stock price will rise. However, the article does not provide any company-specific news that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are relatively close due to the lack of company-specific news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Trump rally, Mag 7 vs. FANG, bitcoin and gold: Market Takeaways\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
