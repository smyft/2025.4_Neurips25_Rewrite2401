(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Samsung debuts Galaxy S25 line with a heavy focus on AI\nNews Content: Samsung on Wednesday took the wraps off of its latest flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S series, during its Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose, Calif. The latest phones are heavy on AI features, with modest hardware changes for the group.\n\nAvailable Feb. 7, the Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Android-powered lineup includes the $799 Galaxy S25, the $999 S25+, and the $1,299 S25 Ultra. The biggest differences between the phones are their screen sizes and camera arrangements. The S25 packs a 6.2-inch display, while the S25+ gets a larger 6.7-inch panel. The S25 Ultra gets a 6.9-inch screen.\n\nOn the camera front, the S25 and S25+ get 50MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide angle, and 10MP telephoto lenses with 3X zoom. The S25 Ultra, however, gets a 200MP wide-angle and 50MP wide-angle lenses, as well as 10MP 3x and 50MP 5x telephoto lenses.\n\nWhile hardware improvements traditionally drive sales, Samsung is leaning on AI to entice consumers to upgrade this time around. Specifically, the company points to its Galaxy AI platform and its slew of features, including the ability to interact with different apps on your behalf via AI agents.Samsung's S25 Ultra is all about the AI upgrades.

(Image: Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nIn addition to Cross App Action, Samsung debuted what it calls its Personal Data Engine, which powers S25 features like the ability to perform AI-powered on-device searches using natural language to find photos in the Gallery app. The Personal Data Engine also powers Samsung\u2019s Now Brief, which provides you with proactive updates throughout the day including a Morning Brief and Evening Brief in the Now Bar on the lock screen.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a number of Samsung devices in your home, such as a smart Galaxy Ring, Samsung-compatible connected thermostat, and Samsung TV, the Personal Data Engine can combine information from those disparate sources to make helpful suggestions about how to best use them via the Now Bar.\n\nFor instance, if your Galaxy Ring, which offers sleep tracking, recognizes that you sleep better when the temperature is set to 68 degrees in your room, but the current temperature is 70 degrees, you\u2019ll receive a notification in the Now Bar suggesting you set up a routine that automatically turns the temperature down when you fall asleep at night.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a Samsung smart TV and sleep with the TV on at night, you\u2019ll similarly get a recommendation via the Now Bar asking if you want to turn off the TV when your Galaxy Ring detects that you\u2019re snoozing.The S25 Ultra gets 5 different camera lenses including two telephoto lenses. (Image: Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to use these AI features, Samsung says you\u2019ll also be able to turn off data collection at any time and delete any data if you\u2019ve already used the tool but don\u2019t want to anymore.\n\nThe personal data engine is only processed on-device, and the company says no apps can access it.\n\nAny services that use cloud-based AI, Samsung claims, provide end-to-end encryption that uses post-quantum cryptography to prevent hacking, even via quantum computing systems. Though those are still some time away from becoming a threat.\n\nAll of these new capabilities come with the regular bells and whistles Samsung includes in its yearly smartphone update, including improved processors and performance. This time around, Samsung says the S25 line will run on Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. You\u2019ll also get a choice of 128GB or 256GB of storage with the S25 and S25+ and 128GB, 256GB, or 1TB of storage with the S25 Ultra.\n\nWhether Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy AI features will actually get customers to buy new smartphones is an open question. AI smartphones haven\u2019t exactly sparked the kind of widespread upgrade cycles experts had predicted.\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock, for instance, was hit with two downgrades this week on fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. Now Samsung has to prove its latest offerings are worth the price of its latest smartphones.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.
