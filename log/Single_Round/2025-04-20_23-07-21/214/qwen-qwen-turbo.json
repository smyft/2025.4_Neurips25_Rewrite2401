(AAPL)\nNews Headline: Apple stock hit with 2 downgrades on weak iPhone sales, AI outlook\nNews Content: Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.
