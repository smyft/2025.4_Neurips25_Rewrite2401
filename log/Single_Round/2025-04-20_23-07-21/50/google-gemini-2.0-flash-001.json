While Apple is mentioned as a customer, the news focuses on 'legacy semiconductors,' suggesting this primarily impacts older products or components. The impact on Apple is indirect and likely limited, as Apple's core business relies on newer technologies and products. However, the mention of Apple as a customer of a company forecasting a sales decline could create some negative sentiment, although the effect is likely to be small. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but neither is a strong probability.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.4,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.6\n}\n```"
