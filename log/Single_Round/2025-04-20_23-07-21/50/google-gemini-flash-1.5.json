While STMicroelectronics supplies chips to Apple, the news focuses on *legacy* semiconductors.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect and relatively small.  Apple is a large and diversified company, and a slowdown in demand for legacy chips from one supplier is unlikely to significantly affect its overall performance.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. A slight negative impact is possible due to the general negative sentiment surrounding the semiconductor industry, but this is likely to be muted given Apple's size and diversification.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Tesla Supplier STMicroelectronics Forecasts Sales Decline Amid Weak Demand for Legacy Chips\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.55\n}\n```\n"
