Since the article presents a comparison rather than a negative or positive announcement specifically about Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be neutral or mildly positive due to the mention of the company in the context of a growing and competitive technology field like AI. The article does not contain any significantly negative news about Apple, which reduces the likelihood of a stock price fall. However, the comparison with Microsoft introduces uncertainty, as investors might perceive Microsoft as a stronger competitor in AI, potentially affecting Apple's stock price. Given the neutral to mildly positive context, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but both probabilities are relatively balanced due to the comparative nature of the article.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"Apple vs. Microsoft: Which Is the Better Artificial Intelligence Stock to Buy in 2025?\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
