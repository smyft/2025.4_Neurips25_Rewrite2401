(AAPL) reported beating Wall Street's earnings target for its fiscal first quarter, primarily due to a lift in Services, although iPhone sales declined. The company's stock rose in extended trading following the announcement. The positive earnings surprise and the immediate stock price reaction in extended trading suggest a generally positive market response. However, the decline in iPhone sales could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the earnings beat and the stock's immediate positive reaction suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but the mixed nature of the report (positive earnings but declining iPhone sales) means there is still uncertainty.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Beats Earnings Target On Services Lift, But iPhone Sales Decline\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.6,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.4\n}\n```"
