While her trades are often scrutinized, they don't necessarily predict market movements.  Her selling could be due to various reasons unrelated to her outlook on Apple's future performance, such as portfolio rebalancing, tax implications, or personal financial needs.  The fact that this is a single data point, and not a broader trend of insider selling, reduces its predictive power.  The news itself is unlikely to significantly impact Apple's stock price, given Apple's size and established market position.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral outcome, with slightly higher probability of a minor price decrease due to the negative sentiment associated with the sale.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Nancy Pelosi Buys Alphabet, Amazon Calls While Selling Apple, Nvidia Shares\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.35,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
