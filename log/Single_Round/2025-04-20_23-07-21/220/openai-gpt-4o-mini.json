This action, especially from a high-profile investor, could lead to negative sentiment among other investors, potentially driving the stock price down. Additionally, the news highlights her investment in other tech companies, which may divert attention and capital away from Apple. While the overall market conditions and Apple's fundamentals will also play a role, the immediate reaction to Pelosi's trades could lean towards a decline in stock price.
