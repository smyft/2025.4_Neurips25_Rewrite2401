(AAPL) or provide any specific information that could be considered directly relevant to Apple's stock price. The news seems to focus on Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) in 2025, which does not inherently imply a positive or negative impact on Apple's stock price. Given the lack of direct relevance to Apple's business or financial performance, it's reasonable to assume that this news has a minimal impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are both low, but given the nature of the stock market, a slight bias towards stability (or a slight rise due to general market trends not specified here) might be assumed.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Latest & Upcoming IPOs to Watch in 2025\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.45,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.05\n}\n```"
