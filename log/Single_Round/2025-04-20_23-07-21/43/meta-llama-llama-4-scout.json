However, it also mentions that Apple has had discussions about testing out ads on the same platform. The news does not directly impact Apple's stock price, as it is Amazon's ad spending that is highlighted. Given that the news is more directly related to Amazon and not Apple, and there is no specific information that would negatively or positively impact Apple's business, the probabilities of Apple's stock price rising or falling due to this news are relatively neutral. The mention of Apple is minor and does not provide clear direction for stock movement.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Amazon reportedly boosts ad-spending on X in major U-turn: WSJ\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
