The question posed ('Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?') implies a potential undervaluation or oversold condition, which could attract bargain hunters or long-term investors. Historically, sharp sell-offs in fundamentally strong companies like Apple often lead to rebounds as investors perceive value. However, the headline alone does not provide underlying reasons for the sell-off (e.g., weak earnings, macroeconomic factors, or sector-specific issues), which adds uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand, cash flow, and historical resilience, the probability of a rebound is slightly higher than further decline, but the lack of specific details tempers confidence.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025.
