However, the question posed in the headline about whether the sell-off represents a buying opportunity suggests that some investors may see this as a chance to buy at a lower price, potentially stabilizing or increasing the stock price. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall due to the current negative performance, but also a significant chance of a price rise if investors view this as a buying opportunity.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025.
