However, the question posed in the headline, \\\"Is the Sell-Off a Buying Opportunity?\\\", implies a potential for a rebound. The market's interpretation of this sell-off is crucial. If investors believe the underperformance is temporary or that Apple is undervalued, buying pressure could increase, leading to a price rise. Conversely, if investors perceive deeper issues or a continued downward trend, the sell-off could intensify. Given the mixed signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall in the short term, but acknowledging the potential for a rise if investors see a buying opportunity.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple Is the Worst-Performing Dow Jones Stock So Far in 2025.
