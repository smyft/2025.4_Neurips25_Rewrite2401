But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49.

While this could be seen as a positive move for Meta (META) to capture more market share in the short-form video space, the direct impact on Apple Inc. (AAPL) is minimal. Apple's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by this news as it does not directly pertain to Apple's core business operations or financial performance. The news does mention Apple's App Store in the context of TikTok's absence, but this is not a material factor for Apple's stock movement. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall in AAPL's stock price due to this news are both low.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.1,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.1\n}\n```"
