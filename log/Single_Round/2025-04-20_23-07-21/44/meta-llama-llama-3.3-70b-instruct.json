However, it mentions that other major tech companies such as Tesla, Microsoft, and Meta have reported mixed results, with some missing estimates and others exceeding them. Since Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday, the market may be anticipating the report and reacting to the overall trend in the tech industry. Given that the article does not contain any specific negative news about Apple, and the fact that the market is often forward-looking, the probability of the stock price rising or falling will depend on the overall market sentiment and the upcoming earnings report. Without any direct information, the probabilities are estimated based on the general market trend and the potential impact of the upcoming report.\",\n\"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n\"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n\"news_headline\": \"These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\",\n\"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n\"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}"
