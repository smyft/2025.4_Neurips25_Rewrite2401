However, the only information directly related to Apple is that its quarterly report is forthcoming. This lack of specific information makes predicting price movement difficult.  Generally, anticipation before an earnings report leads to some volatility.  Given the mixed performance of other tech giants mentioned (Tesla exceeding expectations despite a miss, Microsoft and Meta showing mixed results), a neutral stance is most appropriate.  We assume a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector, despite the lack of specific Apple news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Microsoft, Meta, IBM, Nvidia, Lam Research, American, Apple, and More\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```\n"
