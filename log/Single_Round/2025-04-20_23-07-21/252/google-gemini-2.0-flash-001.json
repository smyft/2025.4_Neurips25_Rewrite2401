While Apple produces consumer durables, the headline doesn't indicate any specific positive or negative catalyst directly impacting the company. It's a general statement about a sector, not a company-specific event. Therefore, it's unlikely to cause a significant price movement in either direction. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome, reflected in probabilities close to 0.5 for both rise and fall, acknowledging the inherent volatility of the market.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```"
