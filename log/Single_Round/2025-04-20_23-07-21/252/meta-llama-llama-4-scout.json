(AAPL) that would cause a significant stock price movement. Consumer durables is a broad category that includes companies like Apple, but the headline does not mention any company-specific news, financial results, product announcements, or market trends that could directly influence Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling based on this news alone is low, with a slight bias towards stability. However, given that the news is somewhat positive by mentioning investment in the sector, I'll assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price rising.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Investing in Consumer Durables Stocks\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
