The expectations are for growth in earnings per share and revenue compared to the same period last year. If the actual earnings report meets or exceeds these expectations, it could positively impact the stock price. However, if the report indicates weaker iPhone demand than anticipated, the stock price might fall. Given that the expectations are for growth and the market typically reacts more strongly to disappointments than to meeting expectations, there's a slightly higher likelihood of a negative reaction if iPhone demand is not as expected.
