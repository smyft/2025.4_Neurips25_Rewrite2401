The expected EPS of $2.35 and revenue of $124.3 billion are improvements over last year's $2.18 EPS and $119.6 billion revenue. This suggests positive growth. However, the emphasis on iPhone demand implies that if iPhone sales figures are weak or below expectations, the stock could fall, even if overall earnings are positive. The market's reaction will heavily depend on whether iPhone sales meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Given the mixed signals (positive overall growth but high dependence on a single product line), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise if iPhone sales are perceived as good, but a significant probability to a price fall if they disappoint.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"All Eyes Are on the iPhone\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.55,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.45\n}\n```"
