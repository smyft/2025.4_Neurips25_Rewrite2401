This is positive news as it demonstrates strong financial performance driven by factors outside the currently hyped AI sector.  While the specifics of the investment aren't detailed, the substantial increase in EPS strongly suggests a successful and profitable venture.  This positive financial performance is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, leading to increased demand for Apple stock.
