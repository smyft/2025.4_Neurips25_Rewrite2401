A soaring EPS typically indicates strong financial performance, which is likely to positively influence investor sentiment. Given the scale of the investment and its positive impact on earnings, it is reasonable to expect a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, market reactions can be unpredictable, so there is still a chance of a price decline, albeit lower. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of a price rise and a low probability of a price fall.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.75,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.25\n}"
