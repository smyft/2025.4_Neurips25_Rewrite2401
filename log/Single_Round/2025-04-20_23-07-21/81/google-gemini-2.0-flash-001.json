The fact that this growth is *not* AI-related could be interpreted in several ways. Some investors might see it as a sign of diversification and resilience, indicating Apple's ability to generate returns from various sources. Others might be concerned that Apple is not focusing enough on AI, a currently hot sector. However, the explicit mention of soaring EPS suggests a positive impact on profitability. Given the positive tone and the direct link to EPS growth, the market is more likely to react favorably. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is higher than the probability of a fall. The magnitude of the rise will depend on the market's overall sentiment and the details of the investment, which are not provided in the news snippet.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.7,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.3\n}\n```"
