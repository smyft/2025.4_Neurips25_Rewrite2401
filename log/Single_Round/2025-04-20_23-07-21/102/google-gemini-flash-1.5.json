While Berkshire Hathaway's investment decisions can influence stock prices, this headline alone offers no insight into whether Berkshire Hathaway has increased, decreased, or maintained its Apple holdings. Therefore, the news is unlikely to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price change is assumed to be close to the baseline probability of a price increase or decrease on any given day, which is generally considered to be around 50/50 in the absence of specific news.\",\n  \"company_name\": \"Apple Inc.\",\n  \"company_symbol\": \"AAPL\",\n  \"news_headline\": \"What Does Berkshire Hathaway Own?\",\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_rise\": 0.5,\n  \"probability_of_stock_price_fall\": 0.5\n}\n```\n"
