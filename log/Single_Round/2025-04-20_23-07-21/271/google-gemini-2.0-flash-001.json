Warren Buffett's investment decisions are often seen as a sign of confidence in a company's long-term prospects. This can lead to increased investor interest and potentially drive the stock price up. However, the impact might be limited as this is just a recommendation and not a new investment by Berkshire Hathaway. Also, the market has already priced in the fact that Apple is a Buffett holding.
