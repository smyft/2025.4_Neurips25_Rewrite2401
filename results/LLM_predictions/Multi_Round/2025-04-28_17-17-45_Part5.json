        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

While there's a range of opinions (0.3 to 0.65 for a fall and 0.35 to 0.6 for a rise), the negative headline's impact seems to be the more dominant factor.  The 'buying opportunity' narrative remains speculative without concrete supporting information.

Analyst Ben Bajarin's commentary reinforces these concerns, highlighting the need for a new hardware cycle to reignite investor excitement and suggesting limited near-term growth potential. The consistent downgrades and negative outlook across multiple AI prediction models over several rounds further amplify the prediction for a stock price fall. The trend is clearly bearish, with successively lower probability of a price rise across rounds. Therefore, the probability of a fall is significantly higher than a rise. The current information does not show any positive catalyst or outlook to counter the bearish signals. Although there are mentions on AI, those are viewed as long-term potentials, not immediate growth factors."

Analyst commentary reinforces this, highlighting increased competition and uncertainty about future growth in China. While AI initiatives are mentioned as a potential future positive, they're deemed too early-stage to impact the short-term outlook.  The consistent downgrades and cautious outlook across multiple financial models across three rounds of predictions strengthen the prediction for a price fall.  The previous rounds' predictions consistently favored a price fall (between 0.7 and 0.8 probability of a fall and 0.2 to 0.3 probability of a rise), and this consensus is given significant weight.  Therefore, this analysis leans heavily toward a higher likelihood of a price decrease in the short term, although longer-term AI prospects offer a small counterpoint. The lack of substantial positive counterpoints and the consensus of previous predictions strongly suggest a higher probability of a price decline."

On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc.

However, the impact of such a trade on the overall market sentiment regarding Apple may be mitigated by the broader context, including the performance of their products and financial standing. The news might lead to increased skepticism in the short term, but given Apple's strong brand and market fundamentals, the stock might not fall drastically. Therefore, while the probability of a price fall increases due to the news of the sale, the overall strength of Apple's position in the market maintains a reasonable probability of price stability or a slight rise in the longer term if investor sentiment remains resilient. Ultimately, the probabilities are derived by weighing both the negative signal from the sell-off against the prevailing positive fundamentals of the company."

While Pelosi's trades have garnered attention and sometimes outperform the market, her actions don't automatically guarantee a specific stock price movement. The potential negative impact of a large sale of AAPL stock described in this article is somewhat balanced by the fact that this happened in the recent past (Dec 31st). Therefore, its influence has been somewhat included in the current market price. However, the negative sentiment of the sale and how people potentially react to the sale need to be considered. Hence, there is a slightly increased probability of a stock price fall. Also, broader market conditions and company-specific factors will significantly impact the price. So while the news might exert some pressure, the potential for the stock to maintain or slightly increase is still there. Overall sentiment can potentially push it down."

While Pelosi's trades don't inherently predict market movements, the sale of a large holding by a prominent figure can be interpreted by some investors as a negative signal, potentially putting downward pressure on the stock price. However, this effect is likely to be relatively small compared to broader market factors and Apple's own performance.  The article also highlights that a Pelosi stock tracker had high returns in 2024, which could be interpreted by some as adding weight to the trades made by Pelosi. In contrast, it also mentions criticism of her trading activity and calls for stricter regulation, which may not directly affect AAPL but might highlight investor uncertainty. Overall, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted, with the probability of a price decrease being slightly higher than the probability of an increase, though neither is likely to be significant."

However, it's important to consider Apple's strong market fundamentals, brand strength, and previous performance, which may mitigate the immediate impact of this news. The consensus among predictions has demonstrated a pattern of slightly higher probabilities for a stock price fall post-news, suggesting that while there is increased bearish sentiment, the overall strength of Apple may prevent a drastic decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of falling stock prices compared to rising ones."

While Apple's fundamentals remain strong, the market often reacts to insider trading activity, particularly when it involves a figure whose trades are closely followed, like Pelosi. The fact that the sale occurred earlier mitigates the impact somewhat, but the perceived lack of confidence can still put downward pressure on the stock. Considering the existing bearish sentiment and the lack of significantly positive offsetting news, reinforces the higher likelihood of a stock price fall. However, strong fundamentals and a possibility of overreaction limits the fall."

The previous predictions overwhelmingly point to a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but the consensus consistently places the probability of a fall only slightly above 0.5. The broad agreement across multiple models underscores a degree of uncertainty, with the sale acting as a slight negative influence rather than a significant catalyst for a major price movement.

The stock is down 11% in January, putting it on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. It has dropped 14% from a December peak.\n\nThe day erased more than $110 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization, enough for it to close under Nvidia Corp. in size for the first time since November. Apple now has a valuation of $3.35 trillion, compared with $3.45 trillion for the AI-focused chipmaker.\n\nThe company was downgraded to hold at Loop Capital and cut to underperform at Jefferies, which became a rare firm with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. Just 8.5% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a bearish rating, while about 63% have the equivalent of a buy.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee writes that recent weakness in iPhone sales has been worse than expected, with the China market a particular concern. Independent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nCiting a third-party survey, Lee added that \u201cUS consumers do not yet find smartphone AI useful,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cunlikely to kickstart a super upgrade cycle anytime soon.\u201d Given these trends, he wrote, Apple\u2019s March quarter guidance could disappoint.\n\nSeparately, Loop expects a \u201cmaterial iPhone demand reduction\u201d beginning in the March quarter \u201cbut materially amplifying\u201d in the subsequent two quarters. While the drivers of the firm\u2019s former buy rating could still materialize, analyst Ananda Baruah wrote, \u201cit certainly won\u2019t be for the next nine months given we\u2019re on the front end of 2.5 Q\u2019s of materially softening iPhone demand.\u201d\n\nApple is scheduled to report its first-quarter results next week.\n\nWith the downgrades, Apple\u2019s recommendation consensus \u2014 a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings \u2014 stands at 4.02 out of five, its lowest since May, and down from an August peak of about 4.3. Just over 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a rate well below other megacap tech stocks, where the percentage of buy ratings tops 80% or even 90%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoffettNathanson downgraded the stock earlier this month, citing concerns in China and the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso on Monday, Morgan Stanley named Seagate Technology its top pick among IT hardware names, replacing Apple.\n\n(Updates to market close, adds market cap detail.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

The stock has already experienced a significant decline, reflecting investor concerns. With a consensus rating dropping and fewer analysts recommending a buy, the sentiment appears bearish. Given that a large part of Apple's revenue comes from iPhones and the dismal sales data, there is a higher probability of stock price decline in the near term."

                    "reasoning": "The news is overwhelmingly negative for Apple. Several analysts have downgraded the stock due to concerns about weakening iPhone sales, especially in China. The failure of AI to act as a catalyst for upgrades is also a concern. The stock has already experienced a significant drop this month, closing at its lowest level since November. The consensus rating is also declining and buy ratings are significantly lower than other megacap tech stocks. Morgan Stanley replacing Apple with Seagate as their top pick in IT hardware adds to the negative sentiment. Apple reporting earnings next week could amplify the negative trend if the company fails to allay analyst concerns. While surprises are always possible, the downward pressure is considerable."

                    "reasoning": "Apple's stock price has experienced a significant drop following analyst downgrades citing concerns about weakening iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market.  The news highlights worse-than-expected sales figures and suggests that the anticipated boost from AI integration is not yet materializing.  The consensus rating has dropped to its lowest point since May, reflecting a growing pessimism amongst analysts. While 60% of analysts still recommend buying, this is lower than other megacap tech stocks, and the two downgrades to 'hold' and 'underperform' signal a shift in sentiment. The upcoming earnings report next week is a key catalyst; if it confirms the weakness in iPhone sales, further downward pressure on the stock is likely.  Conversely, if the report surprises positively and shows resilience in other segments, the stock could recover some of its losses, potentially mitigating the negative impact of the current news.  Given the current negative sentiment and the relatively low probability of a significant positive surprise, the probability of a price fall is assessed as higher."

Two analyst downgrades (to 'hold' and 'underperform'), weak sales data (-18.2% in China, -5% globally), and skepticism about near-term AI-driven upgrades suggest negative sentiment. The stock has already declined significantly (-3.2% on Tuesday, -11% in January, -14% from December peak), and with lowered guidance expectations for the March quarter, further downside risk is likely. While Apple retains some bullish analyst coverage (63% buy ratings), the downgrades and weak fundamentals tilt probabilities toward further declines in the short term."

                    "reasoning": "The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. (AAPL) has been downgraded by analysts due to concerns over soft iPhone sales and the failure of artificial intelligence to act as a growth catalyst. The downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies, along with a 3.2% drop in the stock price on Tuesday, suggest a negative short-term outlook. Additionally, the stock has dropped 11% in January and 14% from its December peak, and more than $110 billion was erased from its market capitalization. These factors contribute to a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising."

                    "reasoning": "The news headline indicates that Apple Inc. has lost its top-stock crown due to concerns over soft iPhone sales, which has led to analyst downgrades. The downgrades from Loop Capital and Jefferies, as well as previous downgrades from MoffettNathanson, suggest a bearish outlook for the company's stock. Additionally, the news mentions that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter and global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year, which further supports the bearish sentiment. Given this information, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of the stock price falling is high."

                    "reasoning": "The financial news highlights multiple downgrades and concerns around iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of growth catalysts from AI. These factors are likely to continue exerting downward pressure on Apple's stock price. Multiple analysts have revised their ratings downward, indicating a bearish sentiment towards the stock. Moreover, Apple's guidance for the upcoming quarter is predicted to disappoint, and the stock's performance this month has already shown a significant decline, adding to the negative momentum."

The stock is already experiencing downward pressure, having dropped significantly in January and now facing projected disappointing earnings guidance. With the consensus rating among analysts dropping and only 8.5% of the analysts now holding bearish views, the overall sentiment remains predominantly negative. Therefore, I estimate a high probability of the stock price falling, reflecting the current bearish outlook."

                    "reasoning": "The sentiment surrounding Apple is decidedly negative. Analyst downgrades stemming from weak iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, dominate the news. The failure of AI to spur a super cycle further dampens expectations. The stock's recent performance \u2013 closing at its lowest since November, an 11% drop in January, and a loss of its top stock crown to Nvidia \u2013 underscores the pessimism. While a slight potential for an earnings surprise exists, the consensus points towards a continuation of the downward trend, influencing my adjusted estimations."

                    "reasoning": "The overwhelming consensus among previous models and the provided news points towards a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.  Analyst downgrades, weak iPhone sales (particularly in the crucial Chinese market), and the failure of AI to boost sales are significant negative factors. The already substantial stock price decline, coupled with the expectation of disappointing March quarter guidance, reinforces this negative outlook. While a positive surprise during the earnings report next week is possible, the current bearish sentiment and the weight of negative indicators make a price rise less likely in the short term.  The previous predictions, consistently showing a higher probability of a price drop, further support this assessment. The fact that many models are converging on similar conclusions increases the confidence in this prediction."

(AAPL) due to multiple analyst downgrades driven by concerns over soft iPhone sales, particularly in the critical Chinese market. The stock has already seen a substantial decline, losing 11% in January and 14% from its December peak. Analysts predict further disappointment in iPhone demand, especially in upcoming earnings reports, and the overall consensus rating has dipped to its lowest since May.

Apple's stock has already experienced a substantial decline in January, and recent downgrades from firms like Jefferies and Loop Capital further contribute to the bearish outlook and are likely to continue to cause further pressure. The fact that many previous prediction rounds are moving toward estimating a higher probability of stock price falling supports this prediction. Morgan Stanley also replaced Apple on its list.

The key negative factors driving this prediction are: significant declines in iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial Chinese market; the failure of AI to stimulate significant growth; multiple analyst downgrades; and a generally negative investor sentiment reflected in the stock's recent performance and lowered consensus ratings. While the upcoming earnings report could introduce some uncertainty, the weight of current negative indicators and the consistent predictions from multiple AI models strongly suggest a continued downward trend.  The previous predictions' convergence on a high probability of a price drop increases the confidence in this conclusion."

While Apple doesn't disclose specific financial details for its streaming operation, the success of 'Severance' and the potential continuation of 'Ted Lasso' suggest increasing revenue streams. The positive sentiment is further reinforced by the data from Parrot Analytics, which values the income contribution of individual titles. However, note that Apple is a trillion-dollar company and the impact of their streaming division, while having strong upside potential, may be overshadowed by other factors (global supply chain, macroeconomic conditions) which drive far more of the company's revenues. The news does not mention the value of that metric as a percentage of Apple's yearly revenue nor does the news mention the company's future outlook. Therefore, the impact, while positive, may not be significant enough to substantially move the stock price but instead keep the stock price steady."

While $200 million is a substantial amount, it's crucial to consider this within the context of Apple's overall financial performance. Apple is a massive company, and the impact of Apple TV+ revenue on the total stock price is likely to be relatively small.  The news is positive, suggesting growth in Apple's streaming services, but it's not a game-changing event that would drastically affect Apple's overall valuation.  The mention of a potential fourth season of Ted Lasso further adds to the positive sentiment, although this is not confirmed.  Considering Apple's size and diversification, the effect on the stock price is unlikely to be dramatic. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is modest, primarily due to the positive sentiment surrounding the success of its streaming content.  The probability of a price fall is low, assuming no other negative news simultaneously affects the stock."

I will take a slightly more cautious approach, as many others had quite high stock increase probability ratings, but the actual magnitude of the financial contribution of the streaming platform to the overall company's revenue is still unknown. Also, I will slightly increase the fall probability compared to others. Considering the current market's uncertainties, while the news is positive, broader economic factors could still influence the stock negatively.

The previous predictions show a consistent trend toward a higher probability of a price rise, but the probabilities generally remain in a moderate range (0.6 to 0.75 for a price rise), reflecting the nuanced impact of this news. My prediction considers the consensus of previous predictions, the positive nature of the news, and the limited impact on Apple's colossal overall revenue. Therefore, I predict a moderate increase in stock price is more likely than a significant change or a decrease."

        "content": "Big Tech is kissing the ring of President Donald Trump after having a contentious relationship with him in his first term.\n\nThat schmoozing was on display at Trump's inauguration as the likes of Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook snatched better seats at the event than incoming cabinet members.\n\n\"I do think that in a lot of these cases, these are companies that had something that they had to fix. They had problems and potential risk that was out there. And I think they were kind of coming and saying, listen, we're willing to talk to you. We're willing to engage and at some level,\" Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe tech veteran didn't attend the inauguration but added there has been \"kind of the war on tech\" that hobbled the industry.\n\n\"The tech industry is very much like one of the US battleships. It is an incredibly powerful force for the United States, around the rest of the world,\" he said. \"I think if we actually start investing in tech, and not just the big companies, but startups, little tech, all of the different organizations that are out there, that's a huge advantage that the US has.\"\n\nCybersecurity stocks have performed relatively well since Donald Trump's election win in early November.\n\nCloudflare has outperformed its peer group, rising about 28% since Election Day. Fortinet (FTNT) is up 18%. ZScaler (ZS) is up 3%, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has shed 3%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NET)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nThe optimism could be traced to several factors.\n\nFor one, investment pros say Trump will be friendly to the cybersecurity business model. Recall that in September 2018, Trump signed off on the National Cyber Strategy. The doctrine aimed to encourage government and private investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. It also sought to bolster domestic innovation in the sector.\n\nSecond, a mega trend such as AI and potentially looser regulations around dealmaking under Trump may spur profits and valuations on the cybersecurity stocks.\n\n\"We believe the cyber security sector will have a robust 2025 and should be one of the strongest sub-sector with our view cyber security could be up 30%+ over the next year led by accelerated cloud and AI growth along with M&A we expect to be very active in this tech area,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nAnd three, a more digital-first world is simply getting riskier by the day, pointed out the World Economic Forum in its 2025 global cybersecurity outlook report. With that comes the need to bolster cybersecurity tools at companies and governments.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"The prevailing turmoil has affected the perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/ intellectual property theft as their top concern, while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about disruption of operations and business processes,\" the report said.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

This positive outlook primarily benefits cybersecurity firms directly (Cloudflare, Fortinet, ZScaler, Palo Alto Networks) making the effect on Apple negligible because they exist in different industries. Furthermore, the article includes multiple events besides Apple's actions, e.g. Zuckerberg and Pichai 'schmoozing,' and broader benefits to cybersecurity firms unrelated to Apple.

While it mentions that Cook attended Trump's inauguration, implying some level of appeasement, the article's primary focus is on the cybersecurity sector's positive outlook under Trump's administration.  This positive outlook stems from anticipated government support for cybersecurity infrastructure, potential deregulation boosting M&A activity, and a generally riskier digital landscape driving demand for cybersecurity solutions. Apple, while a major tech company, is not directly involved in the cybersecurity sector discussed in detail.  Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely indirect and minimal.  Any stock price movement would be more influenced by broader market trends and Apple's own performance rather than this specific political interaction.  The probability of a price rise or fall is thus closer to a neutral position, slightly weighted toward no change given the lack of direct relevance."

Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Any stock price movement will probably be driven by broader market trends and Apple's own performance, not this specific political interaction. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the ambiguity of the news concerning AAPL.  Considering the indirect and potentially neutral nature of the news regarding Apple and the varied opinions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to no significant change than to either a rise or fall.

        "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang during an event in Taipei, Taiwan on June 2, 2024. - Photo: Annabelle Chih/Bloomberg (Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA) reclaimed its title as the world\u2019s most valuable public company on Tuesday as Apple\u2019s (AAPL) shares slid.\n\nThe chipmaker\u2019s stock was up about 2.4% during mid-day trading Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.45 trillion. Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments",

The analyst's note directly cited concerns over consumer adoption of Apple Intelligence and potential consumer preference for older iPhone models over the SE4. Furthermore, reported declines in iPhone shipments, particularly in China, strengthen the bearish view. Taking all of this into account, the chances of a stock price decrease are higher than an increase."

The drop in iPhone shipments, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, further corroborates the bearish outlook. The previous rounds indicate a consistent negative prediction, with probabilities of stock price falling ranging from 0.7 to 0.85. Therefore, it makes sense to adjust the probability slightly closer to these values, putting more weight on the consistent negative analyst sentiment and market data.

        "content": "Doug Gurr ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022 - Shutterstock\n\nThe chairman of Britain\u2019s competition regulator has been ousted and replaced with a veteran Amazon executive as Donald Trump threatens a trade war with countries that seek to curb US tech giants.\n\nMinisters last night appointed Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022, as interim chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nHe will replace Marcus Bokkerink, who is leaving just three years into a five-year term at the watchdog, after an intervention from Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary.\n\nIt is understood his exit is intended to signal that the Government is serious about its efforts to unlock growth, as the CMA has in recent years been attacked for attempting to halt a wide range of deals.\n\nThis includes an effort to block Microsoft\u2019s $69bn (\u00a356bn) takeover of gaming company Activision in 2023, which led to the former\u2019s boss Brad Smith claiming his confidence in the UK had been left \u201cseverely shaken\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, under Mr Gurr, Amazon accused the CMA of a \u201cspeculative\u201d effort to block a minority investment in the UK\u2019s Deliveroo in 2018.\n\nFive years later, Will Shu, Deliveroo chief executive, claimed the watchdog was \u201ctrying to kill companies\u201d.\n\nIndustry sources said the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink, a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, could serve to \u201creassure\u201d the technology sector and say \u201cwe\u2019re taking growth seriously\u201d.\n\nHowever, they also pointed to the fact that Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, has ultimate day-to-day responsibility for the regulator, raising questions over how she will collaborate with Mr Gurr.Sarah Cardell will retain overall responsibility for running the CMA - Betty Laura Zapata/Bloomberg\n\nClash with White House\n\nThe unexpected departure of Mr Bokkerink comes as Britain risks a clash with Mr Trump\u2019s new White House regime over its stance on global competition rules.\n\nThe CMA has already announced an investigation into Google over its search dominance this year, while The Telegraph understands it also has been preparing a second probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores.\n\nMarc Andreessen, who donated to Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, last week said there were \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in the UK on competition rules, claiming they were \u201cextremely draconian, anti-tech, anti-business, anti-American policies\u201d.\n\nBrussels regulators have reportedly put major decisions on investigations into Apple, Meta and Google on hold \u2013 in part to assess the temperature of the Trump administration.\n\nCristina Caffarra, a competition economist, said: \u201cIf anyone tried anything that had the potential to make real change, we now know there would be unknown retribution as Trump has indicated he would protect American platforms from Europe, and they bent the knee.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cThere were four men [Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai] in the front row [at Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration] worth nearly a trillion dollars, it\u2019s very clear he will protect them in some way.\u201dTech bosses Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration - Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP Photo\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said that Labour\u2019s decision to appoint Mr Gurr in the name of growth \u201cseems odd when they are simultaneously appointing their trade union and party donors elsewhere\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, it comes as the Government faces calls to refer the attempted takeover of The Telegraph by an Abu Dhabi fund to the CMA as a breach of legislation banning foreign state ownership of newspapers.\n\nAn investigation of the potential threat to press freedom was paused last year to allow RedBird IMI, which had acquired an option on ownership, to secure an onward sale.\n\nThe process has failed to deliver a transaction, chiefly owing to Abu Dhabi\u2019s price expectations, and RedBird IMI recently urged Telegraph executives to make job cuts and abandon editorial investments prompting a demand for action this week from Sir Ian Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader.\n\nHe accused the Government of \u201cfoot-dragging\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to upset the UAE.\u201d\n\nA request for the CMA to complete the investigation could allow Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, to order The Telegraph\u2019s independent directors to sell the company at a market price to any acceptable buyer.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink. A government spokesman declined to comment. The CMA was contacted for comment.\n\nView Comments",

On one hand, the appointment of Doug Gurr, an Amazon executive, to head the CMA, coupled with the broader shift towards prioritizing growth, suggests a potentially more lenient regulatory environment for Apple and other tech giants in the UK. This is reinforced by Trump's potential trade war against countries seeking to curb US tech companies, and the halt of some EU investigations into companies like Apple pending Trump administration assessment. A less aggressive regulatory landscape could be seen as positive. On the other hand, the CMA is reportedly preparing a second probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores. This investigation creates uncertainty. Additionally, political considerations surrounding the Labour party and their appointees introduce another layer of complexity. Overall, the risk from the probe is only partially offset by the benefit from the new CMA head, as the news story explicitly states that Sarah Cardell retains overall authority for running the CMA. I will err on the side of caution here."

While the appointment of an Amazon executive may initially suggest a more lenient approach to tech regulation, this is countered by Trump's threatened tech war and the CMA's ongoing investigation preparations into Apple's app store practices.  The uncertainty surrounding these potential regulatory actions creates considerable ambiguity regarding Apple's stock price. While a more business-friendly CMA *could*  be slightly positive for Apple in the long run, the Trump administration's potential retaliatory measures pose a significant risk, outweighing any potential positive impact of the CMA change. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is deemed higher than that of a rise, though the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term given the indirect nature of the news."

The CMA has been investigating Google and is preparing a probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores. The article also mentions a potential clash with the Trump administration over competition rules, which could affect US tech companies. However, the news is more directly related to Amazon and Google than Apple. The impact on Apple seems indirect, and the overall sentiment does not strongly suggest a significant immediate impact on Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a minor negative impact due to increased regulatory scrutiny."

The overall uncertainty, coupled with the indirect impact of the news on Apple (the news is primarily about the UK's regulatory environment, rather than Apple directly), leads me to conclude that the probability of a stock price drop is slightly higher than the probability of a rise, although the magnitude of the movement in either direction is likely to be relatively small.

These include Trump's threat of a tech war, the CMA's planned further investigation into Apple's app store practices, and the fact that the CMA's chief executive retains ultimate authority.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions, but there's a clear trend towards a more negative outlook for Apple's stock price over the rounds. The indirect nature of the news (affecting the UK regulatory landscape, not Apple directly) further limits its immediate impact.  The convergence on a negative outlook in later prediction rounds highlights the prevailing uncertainty and the weight of countervailing factors.  While the long-term impact is unclear, the short-term impact is likely to be slightly negative due to the increased regulatory scrutiny and geopolitical risks outweighing the potential benefit of the CMA leadership change.

        "headline": "Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

While Meta has made large investments, they have yet to achieve broad consumer appeal, which might lead some investors to believe that the competitive pressure on Apple is limited. On the other hand, the fact that multiple companies (including Samsung) are trying to compete with Apple in the earbud space could be viewed negatively and may drive the stock down. Considering these countervailing perspectives, the net effect on the stock price is likely to be slightly negative. It is also important to note that Apple has also reported exploring the idea of incorporating cameras on earbuds. Although Apple is a well-diversified company and derives revenue from many sources, this specific news highlights potential threats to a key revenue stream within its wearable segment. Hence, I believe the stock price is likely to have a slight dip from the news."

        "headline": "Did Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dump or Bet on Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nChen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nChen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry.\n\nIn 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Shanda Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nShanda Asset Management's Stake: $116.5 million\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company demonstrates several qualities that make it a solid investment pick. The first factor that may attract great investment is the company\u2019s financial growth, as reported in the third quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% from a year ago and the cash dividend was $0.25 per share of the company\u2019s common stock. The second great factor that may attract investment is the production of the new iPhone SE model, which is being prepared for an early 2025 launch that will include artificial intelligence (AI) features. Moreover, the company has collaborated with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT technology into its devices, which will enhance app personalization and user experience. Lastly, the integration of Apple Intelligence into a broader range of devices, including the iPhone SE 4, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, also holds great investment potential.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, the article also implies that Chen might be allocating more capital to other AI stocks he views as having higher growth potential ('some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns'). The news highlights positive developments such as revenue growth, upcoming iPhone SE launch with AI, ChatGPT integration, and broader AI integration across Apple devices. These are all bullish signals. The article's positioning of AAPL as only 3rd on the list of stocks Chen dumped and is betting on can be interpreted as neutral to slightly negative. Overall, the positive developments (AI integration, revenue) are likely to outweigh the neutral interpretation of AAPL being ranked 3rd, resulting in a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising."

While the article highlights Apple's positive aspects, such as strong financial performance, new iPhone models with AI features, and collaborations with OpenAI, it ultimately concludes that other stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. This suggests a neutral to slightly negative sentiment towards AAPL, relative to other investments. The fact that Chen Tianqiao's fund holds a significant amount of AAPL suggests he isn't actively selling, but the article's emphasis on other stocks as 'better' investments means this news is unlikely to significantly boost AAPL's price.  The probability of a price rise is therefore low, while the probability of a price fall or stagnation is higher, though neither is overwhelmingly likely due to the largely neutral nature of the news itself. The news is more of a commentary on the investor's choices than a market-moving event related to Apple itself."

However, the fact that billionaire Chen Tianqiao's Shanda Asset Management reduced its stake in AAPL (as implied by the headline) might signal caution among some investors.

Considering the previous predictions, it appears that models initially leaned toward a more positive outlook, but there's variability in sentiment.

Considering the lack of definitive negative news and the continued strength of Apple's underlying business, the probability of a price rise is likely slightly higher than a price fall.

This is not a definitive sell signal from Tianqiao, but it does introduce a degree of uncertainty. The previous predictions show a convergence toward a slightly positive outlook, with most models oscillating around a 55-60% probability of a price rise.  Considering the overall strength of Apple\u2019s fundamentals and the lack of overtly negative news, I lean slightly toward a positive outlook, but the ambiguity introduced by Tianqiao's investment strategy keeps the probability from being overwhelmingly high.  The relatively neutral nature of the news suggests the market reaction will be muted."

        "content": "Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Jefferies' revision of its price target down to $200.75 and the concerns over the potential for a decline in sales reinforce a bearish outlook. Although some analysts maintain a long-term positive view, the immediate impacts from both downgrades and disappointing sales figures will likely lead to further selling pressure on the stock in the short term. Given the current valuation and market conditions, the probabilities lean towards a decrease in stock price until new data or positive momentum materializes."

Both analysts express concerns over current trends and the potential for weak guidance, with Jefferies showing a particularly pessimistic outlook regarding sales declines.

Previous rounds consistently predicted a higher chance of the stock falling, and the lack of positive news to counteract this trend warrants a significant weighting towards a price decrease.

This is further compounded by concerns about the slower-than-expected adoption of Apple's AI initiatives and a high valuation (P/E over 36) relative to Apple's growth rate. The 4.1% drop on the news day reinforces the negative sentiment.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple AI models in previous rounds, and the lack of any countervailing positive news, points towards a high likelihood of a continued price decrease in the short-term. While Apple's strong customer base and long-term potential provide some downside protection, the immediate concerns around current sales and near-term guidance heavily outweigh these factors. The consensus among previous predictions strongly suggests a higher probability of the stock price falling.  Therefore, I am assigning a high probability to a stock price fall, reflecting the significant negative impact of the analyst downgrades and weak sales data."

        "content": "Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

While a new iPhone SE and other product releases are mentioned as potential positive catalysts, they are presented as possibilities rather than certainties and are unlikely to immediately offset the current negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% on the news emphasizes the market's concern.

Two downgrades from reputable analysts (Jefferies and Loop Capital) signal a bearish outlook.  The primary concern is weak iPhone sales, particularly a significant year-over-year decline in China (15-20%), a major market for Apple.  Furthermore, the anticipated boost from Apple Intelligence (AI platform) seems to be underperforming expectations, adding another layer of concern. While Apple is launching new products, these may not be sufficient to offset the substantial decline in iPhone sales and the overall negative sentiment. The fact that Apple's stock price already fell 3.7% on the news further suggests the market's negative reaction.  However, the probability of a fall isn't 100% because Apple still has strong fundamentals in other areas and the market may not fully reflect the projected decline in Q1 iPhone sales, or the new product launches may prove more impactful than anticipated. The probability of a rise is still relatively low given the overwhelming negative news."

Two prominent analysts have downgraded Apple, citing weak iPhone sales (especially in the crucial Chinese market) and disappointing performance of its AI initiatives.  The 3.7% immediate drop in share price reflects the market's immediate negative reaction to this news. While new product launches are mentioned, they are not seen as strong enough counterweights to the significant negative factors.  The previous predictions consistently show probabilities of a stock price fall significantly higher than the probability of a rise, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8. Considering this collective analysis and the gravity of the reported issues, I lean towards a higher probability of a fall, although not a certainty given potential unforeseen positive market factors or better-than-expected quarterly earnings."

        "content": "Apple (AAPL, Financial) shares tumbled more than 4% on Tuesday after analysts across the board downgraded the stock, citing mounting worries about sagging iPhone sales and lackluster performance in hardware and services.\n\nApple was downgraded to underperform from hold by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee, who cut his price target to $200.75 from $211.84. However, Lee said the downgrade reflected weakening demand for the iPhone, particularly in major foreign markets such as China. However, efforts to boost sales with new models, such as the budget-friendly iPhone SE, have not really gotten buy-in in an increasingly crowded smartphone market, which has raised doubts about revenue growth.\n\nLast week, Barclays also downgraded Apple to an underweight from an equal weight rating, warning of poor iPhone 15 sales and anticipating more of the same with the iPhone 16. It also long condemned Apple's product lineup as not innovative enough, which, he said, had dulled consumer interest and buying momentum.\n\nApple's hardware business, of course, extends beyond smartphones, and it also has headwinds. Declining sales of MacBooks and iPads were also a long pointer to bigger problems in the company's hardware arm, a historically lucrative revenue generator.\n\nGrowing skepticism of Apple's ability to keep its growth well intact in the face of changing market conditions led to these downgrades. Meanwhile, analysts remain wary of Apple's near-term performance as it grapples with intensifying competition and economic pressures, a selling factor in recent weakness.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) stock is sinking 4% after a research firm reported yesterday that sales of the company's iPhones in China had plunged last quarter. Meanwhile, two banks have downgraded the iPhone maker's shares recently.\n\nApple May Be Facing Major Problems in China\n\nThe number of iPhones handed over in China dove 18% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier, according to Counterpoint Research. As a consequence, China-based Huawei Technologies Co. took over the top spot in the Asian country from AAPL, and the American firm's market share has fallen to about one-sixth. Additionally, AAPL is now number three when it comes to smartphone sales in China.Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nTwo Banks Cut Their Ratings on AAPL\n\nInvestment bank Jefferies downgraded the firm to Underperform. The investment bank believes that AAPL has sold fewer iPhones than expected. Moreover, a survey found that American consumers do not believe that the company's AI is \"useful,\" Jefferies reported. As a result, the technology probably won't trigger a supercycle, the investment bank predicted, adding that the company's results for its March quarter may make the Street unhappy.\n\nMeanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded AAPL to Hold. It predicts that the demand for Apple's iPhones will drop significantly during the current quarter before sinking much further over the subsequent six months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.

A significant drop in iPhone sales in China (18%), a loss of market share leading to a drop to the number three spot, and downgrades from two investment banks (Jefferies to Underperform and Loop Capital to Hold) paint a picture of weakening demand and potential future underperformance. The concern over the lack of consumer enthusiasm for Apple's AI initiatives further dampens the outlook.

These downgrades and the sales decline are likely to negatively impact investor sentiment and Apple's stock price in the short term. The consensus among various predictions is bearish, with a high probability of the stock price falling and a low probability of it rising. Considering the collective negative impact of these factors, including the 18% drop in iPhone sales, loss of market share to Huawei, and downgrades from major banks, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of the stock price falling is high."

(AAPL) presents a highly negative sentiment due to a reported 18% decline in iPhone sales in China, loss of market share to Huawei, and downgrades from two investment banks. These factors, combined with concerns over Apple's AI capabilities and anticipated further demand decline, suggest a bearish outlook for the company's stock price in the short term. The consensus among previous predictions from various models also strongly favors a stock price fall, with probabilities ranging from 0.7 to 0.9. Given the overwhelming negative indicators, the immediate market reaction leading to a 4% drop in stock price, and the consistent bearish sentiment across multiple prediction rounds, it is reasonable to conclude that the probability of the stock price rising is low, while the probability of it falling is high."

These factors point towards weakening demand and a potential underperformance in the near future, contributing to a bearish sentiment among investors. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a stronger inclination towards a stock price fall.

However, the reported drop in Q4 China sales is a significantly negative indicator. China is a crucial market for Apple, and a sales decline there directly impacts revenue and profitability. The lack of specific details regarding the *magnitude* of the China sales drop makes it difficult to assess the precise impact, but any decline is generally viewed negatively by investors.

While Charles Schwab's positive earnings may contribute to a positive overall market sentiment, the reported drop in Apple's Q4 China sales is a significant negative factor specifically impacting Apple.  China is a major market for Apple, and declining sales there suggest weakening demand or increased competition. Without access to the full article detailing the extent of the sales drop, it's difficult to definitively quantify the impact. However, given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's overall performance, the negative news regarding China sales is likely to outweigh the positive general market news in terms of its effect on AAPL's stock price. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but the probabilities are relatively close because the overall market sentiment is positive."

The firm also cut its price target to $200.75 from $211.84.\n\nJefferies analysts, led by Edison Lee, predict Apple will miss its Q1 fiscal 2025 revenue growth target of 5% and guide for minimal growth in Q2, falling below consensus estimates. Slower AI adoption and delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for future iPhones add to the concern.\n\nNew data from IDC shows iPhone shipments fell 4% year-over-year in Q1, while subsidies in China are expected to exclude most iPhone models due to pricing limits, potentially dampening demand. Meanwhile, Apple's budget iPhone SE4 may face tough competition from used iPhone Pro models and Android alternatives, limiting its potential.\n\nAs of 11:07 AM ET, Apple shares traded at $221.25, down 3.80%, reflecting growing investor worries. Earlier in premarket trading, shares were already down 2%. Apple is set to report its fiscal Q1 earnings on January 30, with expectations closely watched amid these challenges.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Additionally, the upcoming earnings report adds uncertainty, which could lead to further declines if the earnings do not meet or exceed lowered expectations. Despite some potential minor recovery due to oversold conditions, the overall trend points towards a higher probability of a fall in stock price."

        "content": "Why Apple (AAPL) Shares Are Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened?\n\nShares of iPhone and iPad maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) fell 4.1% in the morning session after Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the stock's rating from Hold to Sell, and echoed concerns about weak iPhone sales. Lee expects AAPL to report Q1'2025 revenue below consensus estimates when it officially reports earnings later in the month. Similarly, Loop Capital downgraded shares of the iPhone maker from Buy to Hold, adding \"Downgrading to Hold With Material Demand Reductions Ahead of iPhone 17.\" Overall, the weak sentiment highlights growing concerns about Apple's sales strength and dominance in the smartphone market.\n\nThe shares closed the day at $222.66, down 3.2% from previous close.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Apple? Access our full analysis report here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWhat The Market Is Telling Us\n\nApple\u2019s shares are quite volatile and have had 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year. In that context, today\u2019s move indicates the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago when the stock dropped 3.2% on the news that data from research firm Canalys revealed the company (AAPL) is losing dominance in China. The data revealed that iPhone shipments in China fell 17% to 42.9 million units in 2024, pushing Apple down to third place in market share. The decline was partly blamed on the lack of artificial intelligence features in new iPhones. This weak print is significant for Apple since China accounted for roughly 17% of its total sales in fiscal year 2024.\n\nApple is down 8.8% since the beginning of the year, and at $222.32 per share, it is trading 14.2% below its 52-week high of $259.02 from December 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Apple\u2019s shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,809.\n\nToday\u2019s young investors likely haven\u2019t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.\n\nView Comments",

Two analyst downgrades, coupled with concerns about weak iPhone sales (particularly in China due to lack of AI features) and Q1'25 revenue below consensus estimates, point to a likely continued downward trend. While the article mentions potential buying opportunities due to market overreaction, the immediate sentiment is bearish. Apple's significant drop already this year and its distance from its 52-week high reinforce this view. Considering the market's reaction to previous similar news, a further fall is more probable than a rise in the short term. Though the stock market can correct, the trend mentioned in the news content is more than just one event. It shows that the stock price will probably fall more than it will rise."

This follows recent news about declining market share in China. While the article mentions the market's tendency to overreact and that the current drop is within the range of Apple's typical volatility, the confluence of negative factors (analyst downgrades, weak sales data in a key market, and projected lower revenue) suggests a higher probability of further short-term price decline.  However, Apple remains a strong company with a large market cap, and the long-term outlook is not necessarily doomed. The short-term negative sentiment is the primary driver of this probability assessment."

Historically, Apple's stock has shown volatility with 17 moves greater than 2.5% over the last year.

The market has reacted by pushing the stock price down 4.1%, reflecting this pessimistic outlook. Given Apple's history of volatility, and considering multiple downgrades along with significant sales declines in key markets such as China, a consensus is building around continued bearish sentiment. Most models predict a high probability of further declines given the current context, outweighing short-term bounce-back potential. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling in the immediate future."

Despite the mention of potential overreaction and long-term value, the immediate short-term factors heavily suggest continued downward pressure. The llama-3.3-70b-instruct model was an outlier in its prediction, which could represent some unavailable information, but most earlier answers gave probability of stock falling 0.7 or 0.8, so it is more appropriate to stick to these numbers. Recent news also indicates that the company has lost some important market share in China."

Two analyst downgrades, coupled with concerns about weak iPhone sales (especially in the crucial Chinese market) and projected lower-than-expected Q1 2025 revenue, strongly suggest a bearish outlook. While the article mentions the possibility of market overreaction and subsequent buying opportunities, the immediate impact points towards a continued price decline.  The previous drop based on similar concerns of market share loss in China further reinforces this negative sentiment.  Although Apple's long-term prospects might remain strong, the short-term prediction leans heavily towards a price fall.  The previous predictions, largely leaning towards a fall, further support this conclusion. The one outlier (meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct) predicting a higher probability of a rise is outweighed by the substantial negative indicators presented in the news and the majority of other predictions. I give slightly higher weight to the probability of a price fall compared to the average of the previous predictions due to the concentration of negative factors impacting Apple's near-term prospects."

                    "reasoning": "The financial news presents a clearly negative sentiment towards Apple Inc. with multiple analyst downgrades raising concerns about weak iPhone sales and potential revenue misses in Q1 2025. Given the significant recent stock price drop of 4.1% and the historical volatility indicating that Apple tends to react strongly to negative news, the predictions largely align towards a continuation of this downward trend. Previous assessments have consistently indicated a higher probability of the stock price falling, supported by concerns about market share losses, particularly in China. Although some models suggest that the market tends to overreact and potential buying opportunities may arise, the prevailing sentiment remains bearish in the short term, leading to a weighted consensus favoring further price declines."

Recent data on declining market share in China reinforces these concerns. Previous model predictions overwhelmingly favor a further price decline, and the latest rounds show an increasing consensus towards this bearish outlook. While a market correction or overreaction could present buying opportunities, the immediate and near-term pressures prioritize a higher probability of the stock price falling."

This negative sentiment is compounded by Apple's declining market share in China, a crucial market. While the article suggests the potential for market overreaction and subsequent buying opportunities, the immediate impact of the downgrades and weak sales data strongly suggests a continued downward trend in the short term. The consistent bearish sentiment across previous predictions further reinforces this view.  Although Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the confluence of negative factors in the short-term significantly outweighs any potential for a near-term rise.  The historical volatility of Apple's stock is noted, but the current negative news is likely to dominate market sentiment in the immediate future.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considerably higher than a rise."
