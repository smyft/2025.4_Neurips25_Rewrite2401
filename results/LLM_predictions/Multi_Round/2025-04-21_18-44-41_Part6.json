While Apple has faced setbacks in AI, bringing in an experienced professional could signal a commitment to improvement and innovation.

While Apple is addressing its AI shortcomings by bringing in a seasoned executive, it also highlights existing problems and the company's lag behind competitors in the AI space. Vorrath's experience is a definite plus, suggesting a commitment to improving AI capabilities, particularly Siri. However, the article also mentions recent setbacks and the delayed integration of ChatGPT, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The market's reaction will likely depend on how investors perceive the potential for Vorrath to turn things around versus the current state of Apple's AI efforts. Given the mixed signals, a slight positive bias is assigned, but the probability of a significant rise is limited by the existing AI challenges."

Vorrath's experience and the focus on improving AI capabilities suggest Apple is actively addressing its recent AI setbacks.  However, the impact on the stock price is likely to be modest.  While the news is positive, it doesn't represent a dramatic breakthrough or solve all of Apple's AI challenges.  The market may react positively in the short term, but the overall impact is likely to be small compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price, such as overall market conditions and the success of other Apple products. The fact that the AI improvements are focused on Siri, which hasn't been a major revenue driver for Apple, also limits the potential positive impact.  Therefore, a small increase in stock price is more likely than a significant decrease, but the probability of either is not high."

The uncertainty surrounding the shareholder vote introduces some risk, but the prevailing sentiment among major corporations to maintain DEI programs suggests a higher likelihood of a positive or neutral market reaction.  Considering the previous predictions and the overall context, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but the impact is expected to be small."

While this initiative introduces some political uncertainty, Apple's strong commitment to DEI values, as evidenced by its upcoming shareholder vote, is likely to be viewed positively by investors who prioritize corporate social responsibility. The company's established brand and market position suggest that it is likely to maintain its stance on DEI, which could attract investors and strengthen its brand image. However, the potential for political backlash and the uncertainty surrounding the shareholder vote could limit significant upward movement. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the relatively indirect impact of this news on Apple's core business, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall."

Apple faces a shareholder vote on DEI policies in February, which adds uncertainty.

The broader impact on Apple's core business is minimal. Previous predictions show a moderate expectation for a slight rise in stock price due to Apple's strong commitment to DEI principles.

        "content": "Big Tech earnings are coming next week. Microsoft (MSFT), Meta (META), and Tesla (TSLA) all report on Wednesday, while Apple (AAPL) reports on Thursday. Wedbush Securities managing director and global head of technology research Dan Ives joins Morning Brief with Seana Smith and Brad Smith to discuss what to watch during Big Tech earnings.\n\nIves tells investors to \"get the popcorn out\" for Big Tech earnings, noting that Mark Zuckerberg's announcement that Meta plans to spend up to $65 billion on artificial intelligence (AI) capital expenditures (CapEx) is \"the start of this massive build-out of AI CapEx that I think the Street's massively underestimating.\"\n\nIves says Big Tech's massive AI spending depends on the use case for each company.\n\n\"Ultimately, when you look at Meta, the AI capabilities on advertising, on subscriber growth, and ultimately, building out businesses that don't even exist today because it's all about monetizing that install base ... it's no different than the way that the hyperscalers have done it with Microsoft, Amazon, Google.\" the analyst explains.

        "content": "On January 30, Apple (AAPL, Financial) is set to post strongly ahead of the iPhone 16 on a fiscal first quarter of fiscal year 2025 earnings call. BofA analysts continue to see strong Q1 results but warn that the March quarter will be weak, with iPhone sales likely to decline to 49 million units versus the consensus of 52 million. Macroeconomic headwinds and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features are to blame for the decline.\n\nBofA cut its iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 to 229 million for 2025 and 246 million for 2026 from 262 million each. However, the bank is still bullish on the stock, noting Apple's strong cash flow, margin resiliency and its possible pending product launches, including the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. BofA says concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are overdone, given that it has cut prices and will receive potential government subsidies. Analysts adjust the price target for Apple to $253 from $256 as the company's new FY26 EPS forecast of $8.37 yields a 30x multiple.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

However, the medium-term (March quarter and FY25/26) outlook is less optimistic due to projected iPhone sales decline and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence. BofA's reduced iPhone sales forecasts and price target adjustment reflect this concern. Despite the lowered forecasts, BofA remains bullish, citing strong cash flow, margin resilience, and potential product launches. The mention of potential government subsidies in China is also a positive factor. Considering the immediate positive catalyst (Q1 earnings beat) and the longer-term uncertainties, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so. The market's reaction will depend on how much weight investors give to the Q1 beat versus the future concerns."

However, BofA remains bullish, highlighting strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential future product launches (iPhone SE with in-house 5G modem) as mitigating factors.  The claim that concerns about weak Chinese sales are overdone due to price cuts and potential subsidies also offers a positive counterpoint.

However, BofA remains bullish on the stock due to strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches, which may mitigate the negative impacts. Overall, the positive expectations for Q1 earnings likely outweigh the concerns about future sales, leading to a higher probability of stock price rise."

However, concerns about declining iPhone sales in the March quarter and reduced sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026 introduce significant uncertainty. BofA's continued bullish stance, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches, provides some support. The previous rounds of predictions show a consistent trend of a slightly higher probability of a price rise, primarily due to the Q1 earnings beat expectation. However, the long-term concerns warrant a more cautious approach. Considering the short-term positive and the longer-term uncertainties, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the overall impact is likely to be muted. The trend of decreasing probabilities of a rise in subsequent rounds also informs my prediction."

BofA's continued bullishness, citing strong cash flow and potential new products, offers a counterbalance to the negative sales projections.  The consensus from previous prediction rounds leans towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, primarily due to the Q1 earnings beat expectation. However, the long-term concerns warrant a more cautious approach than some of the earlier predictions. The market's reaction will depend heavily on the Q1 earnings report and the investor response to the future sales outlook.  Considering the short-term positive and the longer-term uncertainties, a slightly higher probability of a rise is justified, but the overall impact is likely to be muted. The consistent trend towards slightly lower probabilities of a rise in subsequent rounds also informs my prediction.

BofA analysts remain bullish on the stock, citing strong cash flow, margin resiliency, and potential product launches like the iPhone SE with an in-house 5G modem. Additionally, concerns about weak iPhone sales in China are considered overdone due to price cuts and potential government subsidies. On the negative side, the March quarter is expected to be weak with declining iPhone sales, and BofA has reduced its iPhone sales forecasts for fiscal years 2025 and 2026. The price target was also slightly adjusted downward from $256 to $253. Given the immediate positive catalyst of strong Q1 earnings and the overall bullish sentiment from BofA, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the impact is likely to be muted due to the mixed signals.

The article poses the question of whether further price declines would present a buying opportunity, implying current weakness. The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, suggesting potential downward pressure on the stock price in the short term. The Zacks Rank of Sell is a strong indicator of negative sentiment.

The high forward P/E ratio and the Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) are strong indicators of a bearish outlook. Additionally, the lack of specific positive catalysts in the news to drive the stock price up suggests it might continue its downward trend."

Red flags are going up for analysts regarding iPhone sales volumes as signs of plateauing consumer demand emerge. Under its services segment, which includes the App Store and subscription offers, the company, too, is focusing on slower growth compared to its previous quarters on account of regulatory pressures.\n\nInvestors will look to hear commentary on the Vision Pro headset and its broader product roadmap to get a better-educated sense of whether Apple's innovation can sustain future growth. The report also is expected to feature heavily on share buybacks and capital returns to investors.\n\nApple Shares are down about 14% from their 2024 high, and the upcoming earnings call could set the stage for how Apple's stock moves in 2025. The key risks are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

However, concerns about plateauing iPhone sales and slower growth in the services segment, along with external macroeconomic pressures, create uncertainty. The stock has already seen a decline of 14% from its 2024 high, indicating potential bearish sentiment. Overall, while there are positive indicators, the risks and current market conditions suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall."

While revenue and EPS are expected to increase year-over-year, concerns exist regarding plateauing iPhone sales, slower growth in the services segment due to regulatory pressures, and overall global market conditions. The success of the Vision Pro and future product roadmap are crucial for sustaining growth, and the report is expected to highlight share buybacks. The stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high, indicating existing market concerns. The key risks identified are revenue growth, competition, and macro externalities. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, as the market may react negatively to the concerns surrounding iPhone sales and services growth, unless the Vision Pro commentary is exceptionally positive."

The success of the Vision Pro headset and the company's broader product roadmap are crucial for future growth, and investor reaction to these factors will heavily influence the stock price.  The 14% drop from the 2024 high indicates existing market uncertainty.  Given the mixed signals, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted. The probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely due to the uncertainty surrounding the new product and the macro environment."

On the positive side, revenue is expected to grow by 3% year-over-year to $124 billion, and EPS is projected to rise significantly from $1.47 to $2.35. This could indicate strong profitability and may boost investor confidence. Additionally, the focus on share buybacks and capital returns could be viewed favorably by the market. However, there are notable concerns: iPhone sales are showing signs of plateauing, which is critical as it drives a large portion of Apple's revenue. The services segment is also experiencing slower growth due to regulatory pressures, and the stock is already down 14% from its 2024 high. The market will likely weigh these factors, with particular attention to the Vision Pro headset and future innovation commentary. Given the mixed nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced but slightly skewed towards a negative reaction due to the heightened risks and existing downward trend."

        "headline": "Apple Enlists Veteran Software Executive to Help Fix AI and Siri",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. executive Kim Vorrath, a company veteran known for fixing troubled products and bringing major projects to market, has a new job: whipping artificial intelligence and Siri into shape.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30 Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nVorrath, a vice president in charge of program management, was moved to Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence and machine learning division this week, according to people with knowledge of the matter. She\u2019ll be a top deputy to AI chief John Giannandrea, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the change hasn\u2019t been announced publicly.\n\nThe move helps bolster a team that\u2019s racing to make Apple a leader in AI \u2014 an area where it\u2019s fallen behind technology peers. The company has struggled to match the capabilities of OpenAI, Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. And its Apple Intelligence platform has suffered from a slow and bumpy rollout.\n\nThe Siri digital assistant, groundbreaking when it was unveiled in 2011, has come to symbolize Apple\u2019s shortcomings in AI. Upstarts like OpenAI have created their own, more versatile chatbots, and smartphone rival Samsung Electronics Co. has been faster to weave artificial intelligence features into its software. Amazon.com Inc. also is adapting its Alexa platform for the AI world.\n\nVorrath, who has spent 36 years at Apple, is known for managing the development of tough software projects. She\u2019s also put procedures in place that can catch and fix bugs. Vorrath joins the new team from Apple\u2019s hardware engineering division, where she helped launch the Vision Pro headset.\n\nA spokesperson for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment on the move.\n\nOver the years, Vorrath has had a hand in several of Apple\u2019s biggest endeavors. In the mid-2000s, she was chosen to lead project management for the original iPhone software group and get the iconic device ready for consumers. Until 2019, she oversaw project management for the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, before taking on the Vision Pro software. Haley Allen will replace Vorrath overseeing program management for visionOS, the headset\u2019s operating system, according to the people.\n\nPrior to joining Giannandrea\u2019s organization, Vorrath had spent several weeks advising Kelsey Peterson, the group\u2019s previous head of program management. Peterson will now report to Vorrath \u2014 as will two other AI executives, Cindy Lin and Marc Schonbrun. Giannandrea, who joined Apple from Google in 2018, disclosed the changes in a memo sent to staffers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe move signals that AI is now more important than the Vision Pro, which launched in February 2024, and is seen as the biggest challenge within the company, according to a longtime Apple executive who asked not to be identified. Vorrath has a knack for organizing engineering groups and creating an effective workflow with new processes, the executive said.\n\nIt has been clear for some time now that Giannandrea needs additional help managing an AI group with growing prominence, according to the executive. Vorrath is poised to bring Apple\u2019s product development culture to the AI work, the person said.\n\nThis year, the artificial intelligence group is focused on revamping the underlying infrastructure of Siri and improving the company\u2019s in-house AI models, Giannandrea said in the memo.\n\nThe company debuted its Apple Intelligence platform in October, but the initial version only included basic features like text-message and notification summarization. More advanced capabilities like Genmoji \u2014 a tool for creating custom emoji via AI \u2014 have launched more recently.\n\nApple has promised to overhaul Siri as part of the AI rollout, but that element isn\u2019t ready yet. The company aims to release a new version of the digital assistant as part of iOS 18.4 in April, Bloomberg has reported. The new version is designed to better respond to queries by tapping into the customer\u2019s data. It also can identify what\u2019s currently on a user\u2019s screen and more precisely control the device\u2019s applications through a system called App Intents.\n\nThe current version of Siri has drawn criticism for not understanding requests and failing to execute simple commands. And even when the promised features do launch, they won\u2019t match the capabilities unveiled by Samsung, which uses a mix of its own technology and the Google Gemini platform.\n\nApple is working on an even more advanced version of Siri that includes a more conversational interface \u2014 something more in line with ChatGPT and other AI offerings. It won\u2019t be ready until at least 2026, though Apple may give a preview of the software this year, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIn another setback, Apple recently came under fire for inaccurate AI-generated news recaps. In one instance, the company summarized the BBC to falsely state that Luigi Mangione \u2014 charged with killing a health care executive \u2014 had shot himself.\n\nApple responded to the flap by removing the feature for news and entertainment apps in its next software update. The company didn\u2019t say when the capability would return.\n\nLast year, Apple enlisted another top manager to help bring order to Giannandrea\u2019s group. When the company\u2019s self-driving car project was shuttered in February, longtime software executive Kevin Lynch was shifted to the AI division. He now runs Apple\u2019s secretive robotics team within the organization.\n\nWhen Giannandrea joined Apple seven years ago, he originally served as a vice president reporting to Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook. He was soon promoted to Apple\u2019s executive team \u2014 a small cadre of top brass. But in recent months, current and former executives have expressed concerns about his ability to turn Apple into a force in AI.\n\nVorrath has a chance to impose more discipline on the effort, according to the executive who asked not to be named. Though the Vision Pro hasn\u2019t been a hit with consumers, she brought sanity and reason to that product\u2019s development team, the person said, and the software was vastly improved.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

While the appointment of a veteran executive like Kim Vorrath signals a commitment to improvement and efficient execution, it also highlights existing concerns about Apple's AI capabilities relative to competitors. The article mentions past failures and delays, as well as criticisms of current AI offerings. The fact that Apple is bringing in someone known for 'fixing troubled products' suggests the situation is viewed internally as needing significant improvement. The negative aspects of the news (falling behind competitors, Siri's shortcomings, inaccurate AI-generated news) are balanced by the positive aspects (Vorrath's appointment, focus on improving AI infrastructure, planned Siri overhaul). Given the mixed signals, the impact on the stock price is likely to be moderate. The market may react positively to the commitment to AI, but concerns about Apple's current position could temper enthusiasm. I am giving a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, as the market generally reacts positively to news of companies addressing strategic weaknesses, especially in a key area like AI."

The fact that this is a significant internal restructuring to address a known weakness suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative aspects. The probability of a stock price rise is therefore moderate, as the move is a step in the right direction but doesn't guarantee immediate success. The probability of a price fall is low, as the news doesn't reveal any major negative developments beyond what was already known.  The overall impact is likely to be relatively neutral in the short term, with potential for positive movement in the longer term if the improvements to AI and Siri are successful."

Considering these factors, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise, but acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the fact that the market may have already priced in some of the news.

While the appointment of Kim Vorrath, a highly experienced executive known for turning around troubled projects, is positive and signals Apple's commitment to improving its AI and Siri offerings, it also underscores existing weaknesses and past failures. The fact that Apple is bringing in a 'fixer' suggests the problems are significant and may require substantial time and resources to resolve.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, generally leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise, but with some decrease in confidence over the rounds. This suggests that the market's initial positive reaction is being tempered by the realization that the challenges are substantial and a quick fix is unlikely. The long-term potential for improvement is positive, but the short-term impact is likely to be muted, or at best, a small positive movement.  Considering the mixed signals, the previous predictions, and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, I'm assigning a moderate probability of a price rise, slightly higher than the probability of a fall. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight decrease in the probability of a rise in the later rounds, which I am taking into account.  The fact that this is a known weakness being addressed suggests the market may have already partially priced in the negative aspects.

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nA warning on the world's biggest stocks from one of the biggest names on Wall Street.\n\n\"I think it depends on what stocks \u2014 yes, the leading stocks, they're expensive,\" billionaire hedge fund founder Ray Dalio told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDalio says the Magnificent Seven names, such as Nvidia (NVDA), Amazon (AMZN), and others, have become \"so expensive.\"\n\nIf the 10-year yield continues to rise as Dalio expects, these top-momentum names could be hit hard.\n\n\"If you have an interest rate rise when it's relatively expensive, it's not likely to be good,\" Dalio said, adding, \"Rotation is the important consideration.\"\n\nDalio stepped down as CEO of Bridgewater Associates in 2017 and handed over control of the firm in October 2022. His current role with the firm includes mentoring the committee that has oversight over the company's investment strategies.\n\nThe investment veteran, with an estimated net worth of $14 billion, is no stranger to making against-the-grain markets and economic calls. Some have panned out, others, not yet \u2014 if at all.There may not be much for stock investors to smile about if Ray Dalio's biggest concerns on US debt come true. The Bridgewater Associates founder (right) speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi (left) at the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. The two talked on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast.\u00b7Yahoo Finance\n\nIn an April 2022 interview, Dalio warned me about a period of stagflation \u2014or slow growth and high inflation. That didn't exactly pan out from a growth standpoint as the world recovered from the COVID-19 pandemic. But global economies continue to grapple with elevated levels of inflation that are crimping consumer purchasing power.\n\nMore recently, Dalio has been calling attention to the US's bloated deficit, which hit a staggering $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2024. He shares more of his debt concerns in a new online book called \"How Countries Go Broke.\"\n\nWorst-case scenarios on the US debt (such as a major inflation outbreak) haven't occurred. But the markets are not ignoring the issue, with the Trump administration likely adding to debt levels by extending his signature tax cuts.\n\nRead more: Why TD Ameritrade's former CEO is bullish on the Trump trade\n\nInvestors are fretting over a 10-year bond yield hovering close to 5%, a rising US dollar, risk of a trade war from the Trump administration, policy uncertainty from the Fed, and pullbacks in top Mag Seven names like Nvidia.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nAnother bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini Elon Musk is our best chance in a lifetime at fixing government spending: Former Tesla exec Why you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7\n\nStocks are \"priced for perfection,\" warned Goldman Sachs strategist Peter Oppenheimer this month.\n\nDalio thinks the US needs to get its debt situation in order. Since that's unlikely to happen in the near-term, Dalio said the average investor should be taking a hard look at their portfolio.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"I will say that the important thing if you're building a portfolio is to know how to have excellent diversification, to not be systematically leveraged long. Most of the world is leveraged long right now. But pay attention to this issue with how the debt goes, because it'll matter,\" said Dalio.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The news also highlights broader market anxieties, including US debt concerns and potential trade wars, which could negatively impact investor sentiment and Apple's stock price.  However, Apple's strong brand and loyal customer base provide some resilience.  The probability of a price fall is weighted higher due to Dalio's negative outlook and the prevailing market uncertainties, but the probability of a rise isn't zero due to Apple's inherent strength and the possibility that the market may not react as strongly as Dalio predicts."

Apple\u2019s performance is the worst start of the year for the iPhone maker since 2008, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nThe decline has brought shares within a few dollars of the 200-day moving average, a technical level that can be seen as a long-term support and is one that many traders watch.\n\nThe level is \u201calways a good reference point of trend,\u201d said Todd Sohn, an ETF and technical strategist at Strategas Securities LLC. \u201cWhen you get names starting to flirt with it or start to break below it, you kind of lose confidence that the uptrend of that name is still intact.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a precarious position for Apple shares. The company was, until recently, the largest company by market value in the world, and commanded the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. Nvidia has since eclipsed it during Apple\u2019s tumble.\n\nWhile one single stock doesn\u2019t always move the rest of the index, Apple\u2019s size and position make it one to watch. So far, the S&P 500 has continued to rally, even with Apple\u2019s selloff, but if any of the other big technology stocks similarly start to tick lower, it could be a concerning sign for the bull market that\u2019s now entering its third year.\n\n\u201cThe market has been pretty resilient in light of the fact that Apple has been under pressure,\u201d Katie Stockton, managing partner and founder of Fairlead Strategies LLC, said. Still, \u201cit definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices. If we see that downside follow-through that we\u2019re anticipating, that makes it more challenging, of course, for those indices to shrug it off.\u201d\n\nStockton sees further declines for Apple stock, she said. If shares do fall below the 200-day moving average, the next level she\u2019s watching is around $208, based on a technical analysis called Ichimoku.\n\nThat level \u201cis a more likely point for the correction to mature,\u201d Stockton said. \u201cWe obviously don\u2019t have a crystal ball, but based on where they currently stand, it looks like we\u2019ll see the 200-day moving average taken out and progress toward that secondary support.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple is scheduled to report quarterly earnings Jan. 30 after markets close, a major catalyst for shares that investors will be closely watching. Wall Street expects the iPhone maker to report earnings per share of $2.35 on $124.2 billion in revenue.\n\nOf course, Apple shares could just test the 200-day moving average level and rebound higher, especially if it reports earnings that beat analyst expectations. While the 200-day is a key psychological level that can be a warning sign for stocks, some traders may also use it as an indicator to start buying shares at a discount.\n\n\u201cYou could have buyers who maybe set the 200-day level as a spot to add more exposure,\u201d said Sohn. \u201cSo then the question becomes; if you hold here, can Apple rally back to $260?\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The stock is underperforming, approaching its 200-day moving average (a key support level), and analysts are suggesting further declines if it breaks that level. The negative sentiment is compounded by the fact that Apple has been eclipsed by Nvidia as the largest company by market value. While a positive earnings report could trigger a rebound, the article emphasizes the potential for further downside. The S&P 500's resilience despite Apple's struggles suggests that the market isn't entirely dependent on Apple's performance, but a broader tech selloff could exacerbate the situation. Given the technical analysis pointing towards further declines and the overall negative sentiment, the probability of a price fall is higher than a rise. However, the upcoming earnings report introduces uncertainty, and the 200-day moving average could act as a buying opportunity for some investors, limiting the potential downside."

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) remains a Buy at BofA Securities, though analysts trimmed the price target to $253 from $256, citing a weaker iPhone outlook. Despite this, the firm sees earnings resiliency as a key strength heading into Apple's January 30 earnings report. BofA expects a strong fiscal Q1, with $126 billion in revenue and 79 million iPhone shipments, slightly ahead of Wall Street's 77 million estimate.\n\nHowever, Q2 could be weaker, with BofA lowering its iPhone forecast to 49 million units from 56 million, citing macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features. Beyond hardware, Services remains a bright spot, with 13% growth expected in Q1 and 14% for the rest of the year. App Store revenue jumped 15% year-over-year, signaling strong demand.\n\nAnalysts also believe China concerns are overblown and expect Trump's administration to ease regulatory pressures from the EU and U.S. Department of Justice. Meanwhile, Apple's in-house 5G modem in the iPhone SE could boost margins if successful.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The potential for an in-house 5G modem to boost margins and the belief that China concerns are overblown are also positive factors. However, the reduced iPhone forecast for Q2 due to macro pressures and slower adoption of Apple Intelligence features is a significant concern. The trimmed price target, while still a 'Buy' rating, also indicates some caution. Considering these factors, the positive elements slightly outweigh the negative, but the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales in Q2 tempers the potential for a significant price rise.

The potential for improved margins from an in-house 5G modem also adds to the positive outlook. While the Q2 iPhone forecast reduction is a negative, the overall picture presented is still relatively positive, with strong Q1 expectations and continued growth in the Services sector outweighing the near-term iPhone concerns.  The probability of a price rise is therefore higher, but not guaranteed given the uncertainty surrounding the Q2 forecast."

The consistent 'Buy' rating from BofA, despite the price target reduction, suggests underlying confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. Considering the previous predictions, which largely favor a price rise (averaging around 0.6), and the mixed nature of the current news, I'm adjusting the probability slightly downward to account for the Q2 concerns.

BofA Securities maintains a 'Buy' rating, which is a strong positive signal, and forecasts a strong Q1 exceeding expectations, driven by Services growth and robust iPhone shipments.  This positive sentiment is tempered by concerns about a weaker Q2 iPhone outlook due to macroeconomic pressures and slower adoption of new features. The lowered Q2 iPhone forecast and trimmed price target are significant negatives. However, the strong Q1 projection, continued Services growth (especially the App Store), potential margin improvements from the in-house 5G modem, and the belief that China concerns are overblown, all contribute to a positive outlook.  The consistent 'Buy' rating from BofA, despite the price target reduction, suggests underlying confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.  Analyzing the trend of previous predictions, which consistently favor a price rise (averaging around 0.6), and considering the mixed nature of the current news, I'm slightly adjusting the probability downward to account for the Q2 concerns.  The overall picture suggests a higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but the uncertainty warrants a less optimistic prediction than some previous models.  The strong Q1 and robust Services growth outweigh the near-term iPhone concerns, but the risk remains."

Fouquet said this was \"mainly related to the delayed timing of EUV [extreme ultraviolet lithography] demand\".\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nAs for its results in the third quarter, ASML delivered total net sales of \u20ac7.5bn, which was up on the previous quarter.

He said the firm planned to deliver $10bn (\u00a38bn) in cost savings in 2025, which included reducing the company's head count by around 15,000 roles.\n\nIn the third quarter, Intel beat expectations on revenue, which came in at $13.28bn, versus estimates of $13bn. However, the company posted a loss per share of $0.46, which was much worse than analyst expectations of $0.03.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nAt the same time, positive fourth quarter guidance and a beat on data center revenue, lifted Intel's shares.\n\nIntel said it expects revenue to come in at between $13.3bn and $14.3bn for the fourth quarter, versus Wall Street estimates of $13.6bn.\n\nGelsinger then announced his exit in December and the company's board appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe company's board has also brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip (MCHP) chairman Steve Sanghi.\n\nYahoo Finance reported that there were a number of candidates at the centre of conversations to take on the role, though insiders said there were no clear frontrunners yet.\n\nMeanwhile, SemiAccurate recently reported that a mystery company is trying to acquire the company as a whole. A spokesperson for Intel declined to comment on the report.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLVMH (MC.PA) \u2014 Releases full-year results on Tuesday 28 January\n\nLuxury stocks rallied on the back of Cartier-owner Richemont's (CFR.SW) latest trading update, which reported a surge in sales in the third quarter.\n\nThis sparked hopes of a turnaround for the luxury sector, which has been out of fashion with investor for some time. Companies have struggled as rising cost pressures on consumers forced them to rein in spending and brands have been particularly impacted by the economic slowdown in China.\n\nHowever, Richemont's trading update lifted investor spirits and the share prices of Paris listed companies LVMH, Kering (KER.PA) and Herm\u00e8s (RMS.PA), as well as iconic British brand Burberry (BRBY.L) and Hong Kong-listed Italian company Prada (1913.HK).\n\nBurberry's third quarter update, released on Friday, added to optimism, after it reported better-than-expected festive sales.\n\nThis drove Burberry shares to surge nearly 13% on Friday morning, while Kering gained nearly 9% and LVMH was up 3%.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nAttention will now turn to LVMH's full-year results on Tuesday 28 January, with hopes that it will have seen some improvement since its third quarter results.\n\nLVMH reported a 3% drop in revenue in the third quarter to \u20ac19.08bn, dragging shares lower.\n\n\"It\u2019s been a tough period for luxury powerhouse, LVMH, with sales coming under pressure and missing market forecasts by a wide margin last quarter,\" said Aarin Chiekrie, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown (HL.L).\n\n\"Price hikes in the Fashion and Leather goods division weren\u2019t enough to offset falling volumes, and Wines & Spirits continued to struggle against a backdrop of weak Chinese demand.\"\n\nHowever, Chiekrie said that the recent excitement around Richemonth had buoyed stocks in the stock, \"helping LVMH regain its spot as Europe\u2019s most valuable company.\"\n\n\"But whether LVMH can retain this crown will depend somewhat on its ability to meet market expectations, which are looking for full-year revenue to fall by no more than 2.2% to \u20ac84.3bn from next week\u2019s results, before returning to growth the following year.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MC.PA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L) \u2014 Releases fourth quarter results on Thursday 30 January\n\nOil prices remain under pressure, with existing concerns about reduced demand, while comments from newly reinstated US president Trump have dragged on the commodity.\n\nIn a speech made remotely to the World Economic Forum at Davos, Trump said that he would ask the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia, to bring down the price of oil.\n\n\"I'm also going to ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to bring down the cost of oil. You've got to bring it down,\" he said.\n\nThis prompted oil prices to slide, with brent crude (BZ=F) dipping back below $78 a barrel.\n\nDerren Nathan, head of equity research at Hargreaves Lansdown, said brent crude \"obediently followed president Trump\u2019s calls for lower oil prices\".\n\n\"However, there are signs of industry resistance building to his mandate to 'drill baby drill',\" he said.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\n\"Such a move could undermine profitability for the industry and Rystad Energy and Wood Mackenzie are now forecasting that total US oil output in Trump\u2019s second term will rise by less than 1.3 million barrels a day. For now, a ninth consecutive fall in US inventories suggests that supply remains tight meaning that further dips in the price can\u2019t be assured.\"\n\nOil major Shell attributed its dip in earnings in the third quarter to lower refining margins, lower realised oil prices and higher operating expenses.\n\nShell reported that adjusted earnings fell by 4% on the second quarter from nearly $6.3bn, though this was strongly ahead of expectations.\n\nCommenting separately, Nathan said that Shell's recent trading statement \"revealed that while most business units have been trading broadly in line with previous guidance, the production and liquification ranges for integrated gas has been lowered.\n\n\"These are set to come in below third quarter levels, reflecting planned maintenance at its processing facility in Qatar, as well as the timing of shipments from offshore gas fields,\" he said. \"The weakness should be partially offset by an improved outlook for corporate costs.\"\n\nNathan added that investors will also be looking out for any comments on shareholder distributions, given Shell has announced buybacks of at least $3bn in each of the last 12 quarters.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L) \u2014 Releases year-end production report on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in miner Glencore recently ticked higher on reports that it had held early-stage talks with Rio Tinto (RIO.L) over a potential merger.\n\nReuters reported that that Glencore approached Rio Tinto late last year with a merger proposition but that discussions did not progress.\n\nIn addition, the report said that a Glencore spokesperson said the company was open to merger and acquisition transactions that create value for shareholders.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nSpokespeople for Glencore and Rio Tinto had not responded to Yahoo Finance UK's request for comment at the time of writing.\n\nGlencore reported lower production for copper, cobalt, zinc, nickel and thermal coal in the first nine months of the year.\n\nHowever, the miner said its outlook remained unchanged for 2024 overall for copper production, expecting between 950,000 and 1.01 million tonnes.\n\nGlencore also said it continued to expect marketing adjusted earnings before interest and tax for the full-year to be in the range of $3bn to $3.5bn. Glencore CEO Gary Nagle highlighted that this was around the top end of its long-term guidance range of $2.2bn to $3.2bn per annum.\n\nFollowing the release of Glencore's year-end production report next week, the company's preliminary annual results for 2024 are then due out on 19 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GLEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nOther companies reporting next week include:\n\nMonday 27 January\n\nDr Martens (DOCS.L)\n\nFanuc 6954 (6954.T)\n\nRyanair (RYA.IR)\n\nAT&T (T)\n\nNucor (NUE)\n\nSofi Technologies (SOFI)\n\nSanmina (SANM)\n\nTuesday 28 January\n\nIdox (IDOX.L)\n\nAG Barr (BAG.L)\n\nHarworth Group (HWG.L)\n\nPets at Home (PETS.L)\n\nSSP Group (SSPG.L)\n\nSThree (STEM.L)\n\nSAP (SAP)\n\nAtlas Copco (ATLPF)\n\nLogitech (LOGI)\n\nRTX (RTX)\n\nStryker (SYK)\n\nBoeing (BA)\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT)\n\nChubb (CB)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX)\n\nRoyal Caribbean Cruise (RCL)\n\nGeneral Motors Co (GM)\n\nKimberly Clark (KMB)\n\nArcher Daniels Midland adm (ADM)\n\nPackaging Corporation of America (PKG)\n\nF5 Networks (FFIV)\n\nQorvo (QRVO)\n\nWednesday 29 January\n\nAJ Bell (AJB.L)\n\nHardide (HDD.L)\n\nHargreaves Services (HSP.L)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nAdvantest (6857.T)\n\nAlibaba (9988.HK)\n\nTata Motors (TATAMOTORS.NS)\n\nVolvo AB (VOLV-B.ST)\n\nWH Smith (SMWH.L)\n\nT-Mobile USA (TMUS)\n\nIBM (IBM)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM)\n\nDanaher (DHR)\n\nLAM Research (LRCX)\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nUnited Rentals (URI)\n\nHess (HESM)\n\nCorning (OC)\n\nOtis Worldwide (OTIS)\n\nRockwell (ROK)\n\nTeradyne (TER)\n\nWestern Digital (WDC)\n\nSkyworks (SWKS)\n\nThursday 30 January\n\n3i Group (III.L)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nBaker Hughes (BKR)\n\nBT Group (BT-A.L)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nCVS Group (CVSG.L)\n\nGlencore (GLEN.L)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nSage Group (SGE.L)\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nSt James's Place (STJ.L)\n\nVisa (V)\n\nWizz Air Holdings (WIZZ.L)\n\nAirtel Africa (AAF.L)\n\nRank (RNK.L)\n\nTakeda Pharmaceuticals (4502.T)\n\nAdani Ports (ADANIPORTS.NS)\n\nRoche (ROG.SW)\n\nSanofi (SAN.PA)\n\nABB (ABT)\n\nBBVA (BBVA)\n\nCaixa Bank (CABK.MC)\n\nMastercard (MA)\n\nCaterpillar (CAT)\n\nComcast (CMCSA)\n\nUPS (UPS)\n\nAltria (MO)\n\nKLA-Tencor (KLAC)\n\nCigna (CI)\n\nFerrari RACE (RACE)\n\nNorthrop Grumman (NTH.DU)\n\nMicrochip (MCHP)\n\nL3 Harris (LHX.MX)\n\nDow (DOW)\n\nFriday 31 January\n\nChevron Corp (CVX)\n\nFujitsu 6702 (6702.T)\n\nKomatsu (6301.T)\n\nTDK (6762.T)\n\nMitsui OSK (5273.T)\n\nSamsung Electronics (005930.KS)\n\nNovartis (NOVN.SW)\n\nExxonMobil xom (XOM)\n\nAbbVie (ABBV)\n\nConocoPhillips (COP)\n\nAON (AON)\n\nPhillips 66 (PSX)\n\nLyondellBasell (LYB)\n\nYou can read Yahoo Finance's full calendar here.\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

Given this context, I'm maintaining a slightly positive outlook, but adjusting the probabilities to reflect the inherent risks and uncertainties associated with earnings reports and the mixed market signals. The trend of previous predictions shows a slight upward bias, but I'm maintaining a relatively balanced outlook due to the lack of specific information about Apple's performance."

Given the lack of Apple-specific information and the mixed market sentiment, a neutral stance is warranted.  Apple's generally strong performance and the anticipation surrounding the 'Magnificent 7' earnings slightly favor a price rise, but the risk of a fall remains significant if results disappoint.

I'm slightly adjusting the probabilities based on the trend of previous predictions showing a slight upward bias, but maintaining a relatively balanced outlook due to the lack of specific information about Apple's performance.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 12 Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best Dow stocks to buy right now.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average is among the most popular stock market indices globally. Known as the Dow, the index monitors the performance of 30 blue-chip companies listed on the US stock exchanges. In 2024, the Dow index returned over 16%, compared to a 25% return for the broader market.\n\nHistorically, the Dow has performed better compared to the broader market. According to S&P Global, in the past 30 years up until June 2021, the Dow index returned approximately 11.16% compared to the market\u2019s return of 10.6%. This growth is mainly due to the Dow\u2019s stable, industry-leading companies that offer reliable dividends and returns.\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Most Undervalued Financial Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSince the beginning of 2025, Dow Jones has soared over 4% as mega-cap tech stocks surged following their positive earnings. Whereas, the S&P 500 index has jumped by 3.70% year-to-date, as of January 23.\n\nTrump\u2019s AI startup initiative is already pumping the tech stocks. The $500 billion Stargate AI infrastructure project led by Oracle, OpenAI, and SoftBank will accelerate the AI demand. Tech stocks are already dominating the market driven by the huge demand for AI. Nasdaq Composite returned nearly 30% in 2024, outperforming the Dow and the S&P 500.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to perform better this year compared to 2024 followed by lower interest rates and PCE inflation expected around 2.1%. Economists anticipate a suitable atmosphere for mergers and acquisitions.\n\nInvesting in Dow Jones stocks can be appealing in 2025 as they offer huge dividends and returns. The Dow stocks have strong balance sheets and have a proven track record of high yields.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe shifted through the Dow Jones Index and selected the 12 best Dow stocks based on hedge fund sentiment around each stock using Insider Monkey\u2019s data for Q3 2024. The best Dow stocks are ranked in ascending order of their hedge fund holdings.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Dow Stocks to Buy Right Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNo. of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that designs, manufactures, and markets smartphones, PCs, watches, wearables, and related accessories. Over the past years, the iPhone maker has enhanced its Services business segment with major products including Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allows users to manage payments from their Apple systems.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has solidified its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector while concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software. Apple\u2019s iPhone which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales continues to hold its market. Retaining consumers in this interlinked ecosystem of Apple allows the company to expand its network and maximize its earnings.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, the company reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, a rise of 6% from a year ago. The sales growth was driven by strong iPhone revenue, which accounted for $46.2 billion, setting a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Apple\u2019s services sector continues to grow as the firm reported over 1 billion paid memberships in Q4. The services revenue also reached a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year-over-year.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 5th on our list of best Dow stocks to buy right now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article highlights the overall positive market sentiment towards tech stocks and the potential boost from AI initiatives. However, the article's conclusion that other AI stocks are more promising than AAPL tempers the positive aspects. The hedge fund sentiment (158 holders) is positive, but the ranking of 5th among Dow stocks suggests there are other more favored options.

Both companies have denied these allegations. While Apple is mentioned in the context of the allegations, it is not directly implicated in any wrongdoing. The article states Apple has not responded to requests for comment. The impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal because: 1) Apple is not accused of any wrongdoing. 2) The issue is specific to ride-hailing services in India, which is not a core business for Apple. 3) The allegations are being denied by the ride-hailing companies. Therefore, the news is unlikely to significantly affect investor sentiment towards Apple. A slight negative impact is possible due to the association with the controversy, but it's unlikely to be substantial."

        "content": "The UK\u2019s competition watchdog is to investigate the mobile ecosystems of Apple and Google under new digital market rules that could see pro-competition interventions placed upon them.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it would examine the mobile operating systems, app stores, and web browsers of the two firms on mobile devices to see if the US giants should be given strategic market status.\n\nUnder new rules which came into force at the start of the year, firms designated with the status can have conduct requirements imposed upon them which boost competition for UK businesses and choice for consumers.\n\nThe CMA said it could, for example, require the either company to open up access to functionality within its operating systems or app stores to third party apps.\n\nApple and Google dominate the mobile device market, with the CMA noting that virtually all such devices sold in the UK come with Apple\u2019s iOS or Google\u2019s Android operating systems pre-installed, and the firm\u2019s own app stores and browsers have either exclusive or leading positions on their platforms compared to third-party products and services.\n\nThe CMA said its two investigations would examine the level of competition between and within the two firms\u2019 mobile ecosystems, the possible leveraging of Apple and Google\u2019s market power into other activities, and whether the firms are taking part in any exploitative conduct, including around terms and conditions for third-party app developers.\n\nCMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said: \u201cThe operating systems, apps and browsers installed on our phones and tablet devices act as our gateway into the digital world \u2013 whether that is communicating with our friends and loved ones, buying from businesses or accessing creative content.\n\n\u201cMore competitive mobile ecosystems could foster new innovations and new opportunities across a range of services that millions of people use, be they app stores, browsers or operating systems.\n\n\u201cBetter competition could also boost growth here in the UK, with businesses able to offer new and innovative types of products and services on Apple\u2019s and Google\u2019s platforms.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Apple said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish.\n\n\u201cWe face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nThe announcement comes in the wake of the chairman of the CMA stepping down after the Chancellor said he had a \u201cdifferent strategic approach\u201d from the Government.\n\nRachel Reeves told an audience in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday that Marcus Bokkerink believed he needed to \u201cmake way for somebody who does share the mission\u201d of the Labour Government.\n\nHe left his position at the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) earlier this week and will be replaced by former country manager of Amazon UK Doug Gurr.\n\nNevertheless, ministers stressed on Wednesday that the organisation\u2019s independence will stay \u201cintact\u201d.\n\nThe Government has demanded that regulators, including the CMA, prioritise supporting growth as well as regulatory responsibilities.\n\nView Comments",

The CMA investigation into Apple's mobile ecosystem, specifically its app store and operating system, could lead to mandated changes that reduce Apple's control and profitability. While Apple states it will engage constructively, the possibility of forced concessions creates uncertainty. The change in CMA leadership adds another layer of uncertainty, although the government claims the CMA's independence remains intact. The overall tone suggests a slightly negative impact on Apple's future earnings potential in the UK, thus leaning towards a stock price decrease. However, Apple is a large, diversified company, and the UK market, while significant, is not its only source of revenue. Therefore, the impact is likely to be moderate. The market's reaction will also depend on how investors interpret the severity of the potential interventions and Apple's ability to adapt. Given the uncertainty and potential for negative outcomes, a slight downward pressure is expected."

The investigation focuses on potential anti-competitive practices, which could result in fines or mandated changes to Apple's app store policies and operating system.  However, Apple's dominant market position and strong brand loyalty suggest that the impact might be limited.  The news also comes amidst a change in leadership at the CMA, adding another layer of uncertainty.

Despite Apple's strong market presence and resilience, the immediate impact on investor sentiment is likely to be negative. The consistency in predictions across different models and the lack of new information to alter the market's perception point towards a continued negative outlook."

        "content": "The latest earnings season has gotten off to a strong start, with investor attention turning to the \"Magnificent 7\" tech giants to see if their results can add to this momentum.\n\nThe major tech stocks led market gains in 2024 and the question for investors now is whether they can continue to do so in 2025.\n\nMore specifically, the Magnificent 7 \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet and Nvidia \u2014 were responsible for more than half of the S&P 500\u2019s (^GSPC) 25% return in 2024.\n\nTech stocks were already poised to climb higher this year, with Donald Trump's return to the White House, given his pledges to loosen regulations and cut taxes, as well as to invest heavily in AI.\n\nBillionaire tech CEOs have also been flocking to forge closer ties with Trump, with many in attendance at his inauguration.\n\nRead more: Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency\n\nIn the first few days of Trump's second presidential term tech stocks rallied, after he unveiled a $500bn (\u00a3405bn) private-sector investment plan \u2014 known as the \"Stargate\" project \u2014 to build AI infrastructure in the US.\n\nIn a note on Wednesday, John Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said: \"Trump\u2019s ringing endorsement of Stargate is another shot in the arm for AI in the early days of his second presidency, and supports our long-standing view that the S&P 500 will thrive in 2025 amid growing investment in, and enthusiasm for, this transformative technology.\"\n\nGiven this theme is set to continue to dominate markets this year, investors will be watching to see which of the Mag 7 stocks are leading the way on the AI trend, or if any are falling behind.\n\nHere's what experts expect to see from the Mag 7 this earnings season.\n\nTesla (TSLA) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nShares in electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla have surged since Trump's election victory in November, with the stock becoming known as part of the \"Trump trade\", as CEO Elon Musk has become a close ally of the president.\n\nMusk, who was a major supporter of Trump campaign, was appointed to lead the new Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nThe rally in Tesla shares comes despite the company reporting an annual delivery decline in early January for the first time in more than a decade. Tesla delivered 1.78 million vehicles in 2024, which was below analyst estimates of 1.8 million.\n\nTesla shares fell following the release of these figures and while Musk's expected role of influence on the incoming Trump administration saw the stock rise ahead of the inauguration, it fell back on the first full day of trading after the Republican president returned to office.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThis came after Trump revoked a policy that mandated half of the new US cars manufactured be electric by 2030 and directed his administration to consider eliminating \"unfair subsidies\" on EVs.\n\nMusk had said last year that he didn't think Tesla would be as impacted as competitors by the scrapping of subsidies and believed it could even help the company in the long term.\n\nDespite these headwinds, analysts remain confident about the stock. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter said he believed that Tesla would shift away from launching new EVs and focus on \"popularising\" its autonomous driving software, changing his price target on the stock to $500 from $315.\n\nIn terms of financial performance, Tesla posted third quarter revenue of $25.18bn, which was below estimates of $25.4bn. However, adjusted earnings per share of $0.72 came in ahead of an anticipated $0.60, and Tesla's closely-watched gross margin figure came in at 19.8%, much higher than the 16.8% expected.\n\nAs for Tesla outlook, the company said in its quarterly earnings deck that plans for new vehicles, including more affordable models, \"remain on track for start of production in the first half of 2025\".\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(TSLA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nMeta (META) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO of Facebook-owner Meta, is another tech leader that has been trying to build a closer relationship with Trump.\n\nMeta committed $1m to Trump's inaugural fund and recently announced it had appointed Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO Dana White, an ally of Trump, as one of three new board members.\n\nZuckerberg also recently announced an end to the company's third-party fact-checking programme in the US, a move that was considered as part of a repositioning ahead of Trump's return to office.\n\nMeta shares are up 62% over the past year, though the stock fell following the release of its third quarter earnings in October.\n\nThe company delivered earnings per share of $6.03, which bested estimates of $5.25 and revenue of $40.5bn beat forecasts of $40.2bn.\n\nRead more: 6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally\n\nHowever, expectations were high going into this set of results and Meta guided to fourth quarter revenue guidance of between $45bn and $48bn for the quarter, compared to analyst forecasts of $46.09bn. The company also said it expects capital expenses to grow significantly in 2025.\n\nMatt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: \"Meta has set itself apart among tech giants by turning AI investments into quick wins. Unlike cloud providers that sell AI capabilities, Meta focuses its efforts on enhancing its own products, driving higher ad revenue.\"\n\n\"That\u2019s not to say the AI push comes cheap,\" he added. \"Zuckerberg sees AI as a once-in-a-generation opportunity, and the spending reflects that ambition. Investment will be watched closely, with some $15bn needed to be spent over the quarter to achieve full-year spending plans.\n\n\"Investors, understandably cautious after Meta\u2019s past overspending on projects like the metaverse, will be laser-focused on investment plans for 2025.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(META)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 29 January\n\nAs the Stargate project was unveiled, Microsoft said it signed a new agreement with OpenAI, which included \"changes to the exclusivity on new capacity\".\n\nMicrosoft has been OpenAI's biggest backer and has provided data centre infrastructure for the ChatGPT maker to run its language models.\n\nWhile this new agreement marks a shift in the arrangement between the two companies, Microsoft was still named as one of the key initial technology partners on Stargate.\n\nThe company also recently said it planned to spend $80bn on AI in this fiscal year. Microsoft has also been among the tech companies to jump into the trend of digital agents powered by AI.\n\nIn October, Microsoft announced the rollout of its Copilot features, which aim to enhance business productivity by automating routine administrative tasks.\n\nFuturum Group CEO Daniel Newman told Yahoo Finance in December that he projected AI agents represent a $4tn annual global market opportunity over the next five years, describing it as \"a massive opportunity\" for companies.\n\nRead more: FTSE housing stocks set to benefit from property market rebound\n\nIn terms of broader company performance, Microsoft's fiscal first quarter results beat expectations. The company reported earnings per share of $3.30, versus forecasts of $3.10 and revenue of $65.6bn also topped expectations of $64.5bn.\n\nHowever, market reaction was downbeat, given mixed guidance on the earnings call. There were concerns around pressure on company profit margins in second quarter given the ramp up in AI spending.\n\nShares have had a bumpy ride over the past year, capping gains at nearly 12%.\n\nBritzman said that the key metric to watch in the second quarter results was growth in its cloud computing Azure business, which is expected to come in at 31% to 32%.\n\n\"Microsoft has said more recently that its capacity constraints are resolved, so markets hope to get a better picture of current demand levels in the coming quarters,\" he said. \"Beyond Azure, the rollout of Copilot will also be under scrutiny, with investors eager to see how product development and adoption are progressing after some criticism from peers.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(MSFT)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nApple (AAPL) \u2014 reports on Thursday 30 January\n\nShares in Apple have come under pressure recently, amid disappointing news around its iPhone market share.\n\nApple's stock has suffered two analyst rating downgrades this week alone. Jefferies (JEF) analyst Edison Lee lowered the investment bank's rating on Apple shares to \"underperform\" and decreased his price target on the stock by 13% to $200.75.\n\nLee said in an investor note that he expected Apple's first quarter results \u2014 which are due out next week \u2014 to come in below expectations, and for the company to miss against estimates for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nMeanwhile, Loop Capital downgraded Apple from \"buy\" to \"hold\" and lowered its price target on the stock from $275 to $230.\n\nMeanwhile, Counterpoint Research found sales of Apple's iPhones fell 18.2% in China in the December quarter, according to a Bloomberg report. The research also showed that the iPhone gave up its title of the top selling smartphone handsets in China to Huawei Technologies.\n\nRead more: Funds for investors to watch in 2025\n\nAnd data from from market analyst firm Canalys showed that Apple lost its top spot as the smartphone maker with the biggest market share in mainland China.\n\nThe recent fall in the Apple's shares, has seen the company's market valuation down decline to $3.41tn, and chipmaker Nvidia overtake it once again as the world's most valuable company, with a market capitalisation of $3.55tn.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Apple reported earnings per share of $0.97 on revenue on revenue of $94.9bn. The company said it saw a one-time charge related to the reversal of a European General Court decision that requires Apple to pay \u20ac13bn to Ireland for back taxes.\n\nWithout the charge, EPS would have come in at $1.64. That would have blown past expectations of $1.59 per share and revenue of $94.3bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAmazon (AMZN) \u2014 reports on Thursday 30 January\n\nA major focus for Amazon's fourth quarter results next week will be its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nRevenue for this part of the business came in at $27.5bn in the third quarter, which was in line with Wall Street expectations, but was still up 19% year-on-year.\n\nShares popped following the release of Amazon's third quarter results, as it posted earnings per share of $1.43, which was ahead of estimates of $1.16. Revenue of $158.9bn also beat expectations of $157.29bn.\n\nInvestors also cheered Amazon's guidance for the fourth quarter, with the company expecting net sales to come in at between $181.5bn and $188.5bn.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nAmazon is expecting to report operating income of between $16bn and $20bn, against the $13.2bn it reported for the same period in 2023.\n\nHargreaves Lansdown's Briztman said: \"As usual, AWS will be the cloud hanging over market sentiment \u2014 any growth materially above 19% should get a warm reception. Investors will also be tuned in for updates on AWS\u2019s AI initiatives and the eye-popping investment Amazon plans to spend in the space.\"\n\n\"Meanwhile, let\u2019s not forget Amazon\u2019s trusty old e-commerce arm, often overshadowed by its cloud cousin,\" he added. \"For the first time in a while, it\u2019s showing signs of life, with fresh initiatives like the discount storefront \u2018Amazon Haul\u2019 helping expand its reach. If Amazon can fine-tune automation, there\u2019s potential for some tasty margin expansion too.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) \u2014 reports on Tuesday 4 February\n\nSundar Pichai, CEO of Google-owner Alphabet, was another tech leader in attendance at Trump's inauguration.\n\nA day later, Business Insider reported that Alphabet's chief investment officer Ruth Porat said at the World Economic Forum in Davos that there's a \"tremendous amount of opportunity\" to work with Trump in his second term.\n\nThese comments come after Alphabet has been grappling with regulatory headwinds over the past year. In November, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) asked that Google be forced to sell off its Chrome browser, as part of proposed remedies aimed at ending the company's dominance in internet search.\n\nThis filing came after a judge ruled in favour of prosecutors in a landmark trial in August, who argued that that Google ran its search engine empire as an illegal monopoly. The judge will will now decide what should happen next in a separate \"remedies\" phase of the trial that is expected to start this year.\n\nRead more: Stocks to watch in European luxury and retail in 2025, according to Deutsche Bank\n\nWhen Trump was asked in an interview in October about whether he believed Google should be broken up, he said: \"Google\u2019s got a lot of power. They\u2019re very bad to me.\"\n\nWhile Trump didn't go into specifics when asked if he would break up the business, he said: \"I\u2019d do something.\"\n\nDespite regulatory concerns, Alphabet has continued to show strong performance, with the company smashing estimates in its third quarter results. Alphabet posted earnings per share of $2.12, compared to expectations of $1.83 and revenue of $88.27bn came in well ahead of estimates of $86.44bn.\n\nLooking ahead to the fourth quarter, Britzman said that having \"arrived fashionably late to the AI party, Alphabet is now making a splash. AI-powered overviews in Google search are starting to show their value, and investors will be laser-focused on ad revenue, still the core growth driver with a 9.5% uplift expected from [the] fourth-quarter results.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(GOOGL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNvidia (NVDA) \u2014 reports on Wednesday 26 February\n\nMarket darling Nvidia will be the last of the Mag 7 to report, with investors eagerly anticipating the earnings for signals on the strength of AI chip demand.\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang was one of the few tech execs not to attend Trump's inauguration, though the company was another named as a key initial technology partners on the Stargate project.\n\nShares in Nvidia are up a whopping 145% over the past year, though increasingly high expectations mean markets have become highly sensitive to any disappointing news around the chipmaker.\n\nRead more: Surprising UK pay growth could delay Bank of England\u2019s interest rate cuts\n\nThe stock dipped following the release of its third quarter results, even though Nvidia beat estimates on key metrics. Revenue of $35.1bn was comfortably ahead of analysts estimates of $33.2bn and earnings per share came in at $0.81 beat expectations of $0.74.\n\nHowever, gross margins were lower quarter-on-quarter from 75.1% to 74.6%.\n\nIn addition, Nvidia guided to revenue of $37.5bn for the fourth quarter, plus or minus 2%, which would be just ahead of Wall Street expectations of $37bn.\n\nEven so, analysts remain bullish on Nvidia, with Barclays (BARC.L) keeping an \"overweight\" rating on the stock and raising its price target on the stock from $160 to $175.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRead more:\n\nKey investment themes to watch in 2025 Will cocoa and other commodities rally in 2025?

The concerns about weak iPhone sales in China, loss of market share to Huawei, and a perceived lack of consumer interest in AI initiatives have led to a negative outlook in the short term. While the broader tech sector is expected to benefit from Trump's pro-AI policies and tax cuts, the immediate concerns about Apple's performance outweigh the positive macro trends.

                    "reasoning": "The financial news highlights multiple challenges for Apple, including weak iPhone sales in China, analyst downgrades, and loss of market share to Huawei. While there are broader positive sentiments in the tech sector due to AI investments and regulatory changes under the Trump administration, Apple's specific issues appear to outweigh these positives. The recent earnings report, excluding one-time charges, did meet expectations, but the market seems to be more focused on the near-term concerns. Previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a stock price fall, ranging from 0.65 to 0.8. Given these factors, the short-term sentiment leans towards a higher probability of a stock price decline."
