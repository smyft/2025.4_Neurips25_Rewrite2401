        "content": "President Trump on Thursday called out the European Union for its antitrust battles with American tech giants, saying the billions of dollars in fines they've levied against US companies amount to a tax on American corporations.\n\nTrump made the comments during a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, during which he laid out plans for his second term and took questions from the likes of Bank of America\u2019s Brian Moynihan and Santander\u2019s Ana Bot\u00edn.\n\n\u201cThey took court cases with Apple, and they supposedly won a case that most people didn\u2019t think was much of a case, they won $15 billion or $16 billion from Apple. They won billions from Google. I think they\u2019re after Facebook for billions and billions,\u201d Trump said about the bloc\u2019s regulators.\n\n\u201cThese are American companies, whether you like them or not, they are American companies, and they shouldn\u2019t be doing that. And as far as I\u2019m concerned, it\u2019s a form of taxation,\u201d he added.\n\nThe EU has been aggressively tackling the power of American tech companies for years. Most recently, the bloc fined Apple (AAPL) 13 billion euros over back taxes owed to Ireland. The fee hit Apple\u2019s bottom line in Q4, pulling lower its earnings per share from $1.64 to $0.97.\n\nIn March 2024, the EU fined Apple $2 billion as part of the company\u2019s long-running battle with Spotify for allegedly \u201cabusing its dominant position on the market for the distribution of music streaming apps.\u201dEuropean Commissioner for Europe fit for the Digital Age Margrethe Vestager speaks during a media conference regarding an antitrust case against Google Adtech at EU headquarters in Brussels, Wednesday, June 14, 2023. (AP Photo/Virginia Mayo)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nGoogle (GOOG, GOOGL) lost a legal battle with the EU in September, forcing the company to pay $2.7 billion for using its price comparison tool to disadvantage European services. Google also continues to fight a 2011 antitrust case over its Android operating system, which the EU says the company uses to impose \u201cillegal restrictions on Android device manufacturers and mobile network operators to cement its dominant position in general internet search.\u201d\n\nIn November, the EU fined Meta (META) 797 million euros over claims that it breached antitrust rules through its Facebook Marketplace service. The bloc also fined Meta $1.3 billion in 2023 over claims that it violated data protection rules in the region.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Microsoft (MSFT) haven\u2019t escaped the EU\u2019s sights, either. The collection of European economies threatened Amazon with antitrust fines of $47 billion, forcing the company to change its business practices in the EU. The regulator recently issued a statement of objections to Microsoft over its decision to tie its Teams software to its Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmerica\u2019s tech battles\n\nThe EU isn't the only government body taking issue with US tech firms. The US is also battling Big Tech in the courtroom over dozens of alleged antitrust violations.\n\nAfter winning a landmark antitrust case against Google\u2019s search business in August, the Department of Justice in November signaled it wanted to break up the tech giant. Google is appealing the decision.\n\nThe DOJ has also filed an antitrust suit against Apple, alleging that it operates as an illegal monopoly by making it difficult for customers to switch from iPhone to competing devices and putting restrictions on app developers and app distribution.Former-FTC Chairwoman Lina Khan filed antitrust suits against Meta and Amazon. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\u00b7Tom Williams via Getty Images\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission has also filed antitrust lawsuits against Amazon and Meta. In the Amazon suit, the FTC alleges the e-commerce retailer wields its enormous power to disadvantage other retailers via anti-discounting measures.\n\nIt further alleges that Amazon requires sellers to use its fulfillment service to gain access to the company\u2019s Prime service, making it more expensive for those sellers to offer their goods on other platforms.\n\nIn the Meta case, set for trial in 2025, the FTC claims the social media company ran an illegal \u201cbuy-or-bury\u201d scheme to either purchase or crush competing social platforms. The FTC is calling for Meta to unwind its acquisitions of both Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nThe FTC initially brought its case against Meta under the Trump administration, but Lina Khan, the FTC chair for the Biden administration, refiled it after that initial dismissal.\n\nTrump\u2019s tech turnaround\n\nAhead of the 2024 election, Big Tech CEOs sought to cozy up to Trump, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg praising the then-candidate\u2019s reaction to an assassination attempt in July 2024. Trump had previously threatened to jail Zuckerberg in his book.Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump. (Photo by Saul Loeb-Pool/Getty Images)\u00b7Pool via Getty Images\n\nAmazon founder Jeff Bezos has also come out in support of Trump, with Amazon donating $1 million to his inauguration campaign. Bezos and Trump had an acrimonious relationship during Trump\u2019s first term with Trump criticizing Bezos over the Washington Post's reporting about him. Bezos owns the Post.\n\nAhead of the election, Bezos prevented the Post\u2019s editorial board from endorsing Trump\u2019s rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris, for president.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft also donated $1 million to Trump\u2019s inauguration, as did Apple CEO Tim Cook and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.\n\nAltman, Bezos, Cook, Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai each attended Trump\u2019s inauguration Monday, sitting just behind Trump\u2019s lectern while other Republican leaders viewed the proceedings from an overflow area.\n\nWith Big Tech working to gain Trump\u2019s favor and the president openly defending them against EU antitrust matters, there\u2019s a chance that the companies could enjoy a far more forgiving regulatory environment for the next four years.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Trump's support against EU antitrust actions is a positive, potentially reducing future financial burdens from fines. This could be seen as a bullish signal. However, the article also highlights existing fines and ongoing antitrust scrutiny in both the EU and the US. The US DOJ's antitrust suit against Apple, alleging an illegal monopoly, is a significant negative. The fact that Big Tech CEOs are trying to cozy up to Trump suggests they anticipate continued regulatory pressure, even with his support. The existing fines have already impacted Apple's earnings, as noted in the article. Considering these factors, the positive impact of Trump's support is somewhat offset by the ongoing legal battles and the potential for future regulatory challenges. The market's reaction will likely depend on whether investors focus more on the potential for reduced EU fines or the continued threat of US antitrust action. Given the existing DOJ lawsuit, I believe the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positive."

While Trump's stance might be seen as positive for Apple in the short term, suggesting a potentially more lenient regulatory environment under a potential second Trump administration, several factors complicate a simple prediction.  The article also mentions ongoing antitrust lawsuits against Apple in the US, which are independent of the EU actions and pose a significant risk.  The EU fines have already negatively impacted Apple's earnings, and the possibility of further fines or regulatory actions remains.  Therefore, while Trump's comments might offer a slight short-term boost to investor sentiment, the overall impact is uncertain due to the ongoing legal battles and the inherent volatility of the market.  The probability of a price rise is tempered by the significant existing and potential future legal challenges.  The probabilities are assigned based on a balanced assessment of these opposing forces."

However, the impact is nuanced as the US also has ongoing antitrust suits against these companies. The article also mentions that Big Tech CEOs have been seeking to gain Trump's favor, which could indicate a strategic alignment. Given this context, the stock price of Apple might see a slight increase due to the perceived positive regulatory outlook, but the probabilities are not skewed extremely in either direction due to the complexity and ongoing nature of these regulatory battles."

However, the market has already priced in these expectations. Since the article is behind a paywall, we lack the full context of Morgan Stanley's analysis. Without knowing the specifics of their report (e.g., future guidance, commentary on specific product lines), it's difficult to make a strong prediction. I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall because 'in line' results can sometimes disappoint investors who were hoping for a beat, and the lack of further information from the article makes it difficult to assess any potential positive catalysts."

The lack of detail in the news article (due to the paywall) limits the available information. However, the consistent trend across multiple AI models and multiple prediction rounds shows a slight but persistent leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise (around 0.55). This is likely because meeting expectations, even without exceeding them, can be viewed positively by investors as a sign of stability and confirmation of existing market forecasts.  While a negative reaction is possible (due to potential disappointment among investors hoping for a beat, or broader market factors), the overall lack of strong negative news and the consistent positive bias in the previous predictions suggests a relatively low probability of a significant price drop. Therefore, I'm weighting the probability slightly towards a price rise, reflecting the consensus and the generally positive interpretation of meeting expectations, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the possibility of a price fall."

        "content": "We recently published a list of Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s Top Stock Picks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Billionaire Dan Loeb\u2019s top stock picks.\n\nDan Loeb is an American billionaire, activist investor, and hedge fund manager best known as the founder and CEO of Third Point, a New York-based hedge fund. Known for his bold activist strategies, sharp letters to corporate boards, and remarkable investment acumen, Loeb has become one of the most influential figures in the hedge fund industry. His ability to identify undervalued companies, implement changes to unlock value, and deliver strong returns for investors has solidified his reputation as a financial powerhouse. He was born in 1961 in California. Coming from an affluent family, his father was a partner at a prominent law firm, and his mother was a historian. Loeb attended the University of California, Berkeley, where he initially studied at the business school before transferring to the College of Letters and Science. He graduated with a degree in economics in 1983.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nLoeb\u2019s early career in finance saw him working at Warburg Pincus in private equity and later at Citigroup in risk arbitrage. These roles provided him with the foundation to understand markets, value creation, and capital allocation. In 1995, Loeb launched Third Point LLC with $3.3 million in capital, including $300,000 of his own money. The firm initially operated as a scrappy startup but quickly grew in prominence thanks to Loeb\u2019s exceptional returns and his willingness to engage in public activist campaigns. As of the end of the third quarter of 2024, Third Point manages over $7.4 billion in 13F securities. Third Point has delivered double-digit annualized returns since its inception, with Loeb\u2019s keen investment instincts driving its success. Loeb takes large, concentrated positions in companies he believes can be turned around.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Third Point at the end of the third quarter of 2024.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nThird Point\u2019s Stake: $216.7 million\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm.

This would drive future innovation, enhance brand loyalty, and support sustainable growth. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) commits to protecting the planet by focusing on recycled and renewable materials, clean electricity, and low-carbon shipping.

This could lead to concerns about potential revenue loss for Apple if users prefer Epic's marketplace over Apple's. However, the overall impact on Apple's stock price may be mitigated by the company's strong brand loyalty and diverse product offerings. Therefore, while there is a risk of a negative impact, the extent may not be severe enough to cause a significant drop in stock price. Thus, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise."

While it might not immediately impact Apple's revenue significantly, it signals increasing competition and potential erosion of Apple's control over its ecosystem. This could lead to investor concern about future revenue streams and market share. However, Apple is a large, diversified company, and this single event is unlikely to cause a major stock price drop. The impact on Google is also relevant, but the focus here is on Apple. The news is more likely to create a slight negative sentiment than a positive one."

The overwhelming consensus across multiple prediction rounds from various models points towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8. This reflects the potential for gradual revenue erosion rather than a sudden collapse. While the threat is real, it's not an immediate existential crisis for Apple. Considering the previous predictions, the incomplete nature of the news article, and Apple's overall strength, a slight negative impact is more probable than a significant positive one in the short term.  My prediction reflects this consensus while acknowledging the mitigating factors, leaning slightly more towards the negative due to the consistent trend in previous predictions.

        "content": "The Indian government has requested Apple (AAPL, Financials) and Alphabet (GOOGL, Financials) to host the GOV.in app suite on their respective app stores to enhance public access to government services, Bloomberg News reported, citing individuals familiar with the matter.\n\nMeeting with officials from Apple, Google, and other smartphone companies last month, India's technology minister proposed direct user access to the government-backed software suite. Officials recommended that the applications be pre-installed on Indian-sold handsets and made accessible for download free from warnings including \"untrusted source.\"\n\nGoogle, whose Android operating system runs over 90% of India's around 700 million cellphones, is apparently turning down the demand. Apple is also reported to be reluctant to cooperate. The government has said it could use legal actions or policy directives to compel compliance.\n\nBelieving the GOV.in app suite might increase utilization if combined into a single package in the app stores, the ministry seeks to spread public-welfare services via technology. Right now, Google's Play Store and Apple's App Store each include separate apps.\n\nApple also made a similar action in 2021 in Russia, giving consumers the choice to install government-recommended applications to follow local rules.\n\nTo protect the mobile ecosystem, Google has apparently shown a readiness to work with Indian authorities.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Forced pre-installation or altered app store warnings could negatively impact user experience and brand perception, potentially leading to a stock price decrease. The comparison to the Russian situation in 2021 suggests Apple might eventually comply, but the initial resistance indicates concern about maintaining its ecosystem integrity. On the other hand, the impact is likely limited. India is a significant market, but Apple's global presence is vast. The potential for increased user access to government services could be seen as a positive, albeit a minor one. Google's resistance might give Apple some leverage in negotiations. Overall, the negative aspects slightly outweigh the positives, but the impact is unlikely to be dramatic. The market's reaction will depend on how Apple navigates this situation and whether the Indian government follows through with its threats."

While this could potentially increase app usage and indirectly benefit Apple through increased device usage in India, Apple's reluctance and potential for legal challenges suggest a low probability of significant positive impact on the stock price.  Apple's past compliance with similar requests in Russia doesn't guarantee a similar outcome in India, and the potential for negative publicity related to government mandates could outweigh any potential benefits. The overall impact is likely to be minimal, with the market likely already pricing in similar geopolitical risks.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is low, and the probability of a stock price fall is also low, with the most likely scenario being little to no change."

The situation is further complicated by the lack of clarity on the potential impact on Apple's operations in India and the overall user experience.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a higher probability of a price fall.  However, Apple's size and global diversification likely mitigate the impact of this specific event.  Considering the potential for negative publicity and regulatory challenges, alongside Apple's history of compliance in similar situations (Russia), a moderate probability of a price fall is more likely than a significant rise. The overall impact is likely to be minimal, with the market likely already pricing in similar geopolitical risks.  The probability of a price rise is tempered by the uncertainty and potential negative sentiment surrounding the situation."

        "content": "(Reuters) - \"Fortnite\" maker Epic Games said on Thursday it will add 19 third-party games to its own marketplace app on Google's Android globally and 16 games on Apple's iOS in the European Union.\n\nThe videogame company had launched its mobile game store in 2024, allowing it to avoid fees imposed by conventional app marketplaces such as Google's Play and Apple's App Store while making in-app purchases.\n\nEpic Games had also argued that users did not have much choice beyond the two popular app stores for downloading gaming applications, suppressing competition.\n\nIt will launch a program to offer free games on its mobile store, starting with titles such as \"Bloons TD 6\" and \"Dungeon of the Endless: Apogee\".\n\nThe company said it would temporarily cover core technology fees, the 0.50 euros ($0.5210) charged by Apple on every app after it crosses 1 million installs, for developers that participate in Epic's free-games program in Europe.\n\n\"We are opening up the Epic Games Store to mobile games from third parties, starting with a small catalog and expanding over time to a very big catalog,\" CEO Tim Sweeney told reporters.\n\n\"Our aim here isn't just to launch a bunch of different stores and different places, but to build a single cross-platform store.\"\n\nNorth Carolina-based Epic Games reached 29 million users for its mobile store by end-2024, falling short of its target of 100 million users.\n\nThe company also offers a computer graphics software, called \"Unreal Engine\", which is widely used by app developers to design and develop games.\n\nApple had approved Epic Games' marketplace app in Europe last year. Epic had faced off with Google and Apple over their rules of charging up to 30% commissions on app store payments.\n\nAfter getting banned for nearly four years, Epic's \"Fortnite\" returned on iPhones in the European Union and Android devices globally.\n\n($1 = 0.9598 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru and Supantha Mukherjee in Stockholm; Editing by Devika Syamnath)\n\nView Comments",

On one hand, it highlights competition in the app marketplace, which could pressure Apple's App Store revenue model. However, the impact may be limited as Epic's store is still in its early stages and has not yet reached its user targets. Additionally, Apple's strong brand and ecosystem may mitigate any immediate negative effects. Therefore, while there is a potential for a slight decline in stock price due to increased competition, the overall impact may not be significant enough to warrant a high probability of a fall."

This is a direct challenge to Apple's App Store, which has historically enjoyed a dominant position and high commission rates. While Apple has approved Epic's marketplace in the EU, the increased competition could potentially erode Apple's App Store revenue, especially in the long term. However, the impact is likely to be limited initially, as the expansion is gradual and focused on the EU for iOS. Furthermore, Epic's mobile store user base is currently significantly smaller than Apple's. The return of Fortnite to iPhones in the EU is a positive development for Epic, but its impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal. Overall, the news presents a slight negative sentiment for Apple, but the immediate impact is unlikely to be substantial. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise."

While Epic's actions represent increased competition in the mobile app store market, the scale of this impact is limited. Epic's mobile store user base is significantly smaller than Apple's App Store, and the focus is primarily on the EU.  Apple's App Store revenue is substantial and diversified across many app categories, making the impact of a few additional third-party games relatively small.  The news that Fortnite returned to iPhones in the EU is positive for Epic but doesn't directly translate to a negative impact on Apple.  The temporary fee subsidy by Epic is a short-term strategy and unlikely to significantly alter Apple's long-term revenue streams. Therefore, the probability of a stock price movement in either direction is low."

This development is part of a broader trend where companies like Epic Games are challenging Apple's dominance and fees in the app marketplace. Given that Apple generates significant revenue from its App Store, any move that could disrupt this revenue stream, even marginally, might negatively impact investor sentiment. However, the impact might be limited as Epic Games' mobile store currently has a much smaller user base compared to Apple's App Store, and the immediate financial impact on Apple is likely to be minimal."

Apple's overall market dominance and ecosystem are unlikely to be significantly impacted in the short term.

The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.55 to 0.65 in most models across rounds.  While the increased competition is a valid concern, the short-term effect on Apple's stock price is unlikely to be substantial.  The consensus among the previous models suggests a modest negative impact, but not a significant one.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Artificial intelligence startup Perplexity launched an agent-based assistant for Android devices on Thursday as it looks to take on larger rival OpenAI's ChatGPT and incumbent assistants such as Apple's Siri and Amazon's Alexa.\n\nThe Nvidia and Jeff Bezos-backed company said the tool, known as Perplexity Assistant, can book dinner reservations, hail rides on apps and set reminders, among other actions. It is available in 15 languages on Google's Play Store.\n\n\"We'd love to make it available on iOS, and if Apple gives us the right permissions, we'll make it happen,\" a spokesperson for Perplexity said.\n\nOpenAI rolled out a similar tool, called Tasks, to ChatGPT Team and Pro subscribers last week on the web platform.\n\nTech giants Amazon and Apple have also been developing more advanced versions of their assistants.\n\nLast year, Apple incorporated Apple Intelligence into its voice assistant, Siri, and in a partnership with OpenAI, the iPhone maker also introduced the use of ChatGPT, with user permission. Meanwhile, Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, said in December that a refreshed version of their voice assistant, Alexa, is on the horizon and expected to launch in the \"coming months.\"\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Alan Barona)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Epic Games Inc., developer of the popular Fortnite shooter title, is adding games from third parties to its new mobile marketplace, stepping up a long, costly dispute with Apple Inc. and Google over their app-store fees.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat Happened to Hanging Out on the Street? How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Billionaire Developer Caruso Slams LA Leadership Over Wildfires Hoboken PATH Station Will Close for Almost a Month on Jan. 30\n\nThe titles represent the first batch of mobile games from outside developers to appear on the Epic Games Store, the company said Thursday, and will include ones played on Google Android devices globally and Apple iOS devices in Europe. Some will be free to play.\n\nEpic Games\u2019 mobile store debuted in August with its own products, titles such as Fortnite and Rocket League. The company has invested more than $1 billion in its digital storefront for video games and mobile apps, founder and Chief Executive Officer Tim Sweeney said in a meeting with reporters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re spending more money than we\u2019re making every year because we choose to invest in growth,\u201d he said.\n\nSweeney has been battling in the courts and the marketplace since 2020 to shake the hold over mobile apps held by Apple and Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google. While the company has wrung some concessions from the technology leaders, fans still struggle to download the Epic Games Store from devices that use their software.\n\n\u201cApple and Google are making this really hard,\u201d Sweeney said. \u201cWe had a goal of 100 million installs with first-party games. We knew that would be really hard. We ended up at 30 million.\u201d\n\nSweeney blames impediments thrown up by the companies, including pop-ups and other deterrents.\n\nIn 2023, a federal appeals court in California ruled mostly in favor of Apple on allegations by Epic that the iPhone maker\u2019s app store was a monopoly. However, Apple was asked to open up its App Store to outside payment options. Epic won an antitrust case against Google.\n\nApple and Google collected an estimated $23 billion in 2023 from the 30% cut they take from app store sales, according to a report from Matthew Ball, CEO of the investment advisory firm Epyllion.\n\n\u201cThe stores\u2019 fees deprive developers of much-needed margin for reinvestment,\u201d Ball said. \u201cTheir controls have also impeded the development of new experiences and business models that might restore growth and/or create new genres and companies.\u201d\n\nSweeney, whose desktop and mobile store charges a 12% commission, calls the Apple and Google app stores \u201cthe biggest abuse of market power in modern history.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nSo far, Epic said, none of the 100 highest-grossing mobile game developers has been willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store because of Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee and other restrictions imposed by the companies.\n\nUnder Apple\u2019s Core Technology Fee, the most popular mobile games may be subject to a download fee when a developer opts to distribute them on an alternative app store. To ease the burden, Epic will cover the cost for all titles from developers that participate in the Epic Games Store\u2019s free games program on iOS or iPadOS devices.\n\n\u201cThe word for spending more money than you\u2019re making when you have a great business underneath is \u2018investment,\u2019\u201d Sweeney said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nForget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations Green Investors Find a Silver Lining in Trump\u2019s Presidency How Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's core business or financials.

On one hand, Epic Games' continued challenge to Apple's App Store policies, including the Core Technology Fee, could eventually lead to changes that reduce Apple's revenue from the App Store. The fact that no top 100 grossing mobile game developers are willing to offer titles on the Epic Games Store due to Apple's fees is a negative signal. However, the legal battles have largely favored Apple so far, and the company has significant market power. The news also highlights Apple's continued dominance in the app ecosystem, despite Epic's efforts. The impact of Epic's actions is likely to be gradual and limited in the short term. Given Apple's strong financial position and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of Epic's challenge, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise.

However, it could also lead to increased market share in India, a large and growing market.  The lack of detail in the headline makes it difficult to assess the potential magnitude of either positive or negative effects.  Therefore, I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability distribution, slightly leaning towards a negative impact due to the potential for reduced control and revenue."

Additionally, the news does not indicate any immediate negative impact on Apple's product offerings or market position.

Samsung's Galaxy S25, leveraging Google AI and Qualcomm tech, aims to challenge Apple's iPhone. While Samsung's move could potentially erode Apple's market share, Apple is also innovating with its iPhone 17 Air and AI features. The article also mentions Apple's reliance on iPhone sales, but growth potential in services and wearables. The impact on Apple's stock is likely to be slightly negative, as increased competition often leads to investor uncertainty. However, Apple's established brand and ecosystem provide a buffer. The fact that Qualcomm's stock is down premarket suggests the market isn't overly enthusiastic about Samsung's move, which could indirectly affect Apple as well. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock is more probable than a rise."

While this presents a competitive threat to Apple, several factors mitigate a significant negative impact on AAPL's stock price. Apple's strong brand loyalty, robust ecosystem, and the upcoming launch of the iPhone 17 Air with its own AI features are significant buffers.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news' impact.  The fact that Qualcomm's stock is down pre-market suggests the market isn't overly enthusiastic about Samsung's move, which could indirectly lessen the negative impact on Apple.  Considering the overall competitive landscape and Apple's strengths, a significant price movement in either direction is unlikely. A slight downward pressure is possible due to increased competition, but the probability of a substantial fall is low.  The consensus from previous models leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the magnitude is expected to be minimal.  Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a slightly higher chance of a minor price decrease, but with a significant probability of no significant change."

        "headline": "Big Tech earnings are coming, and Trump will be top of mind for investors",
        "content": "Big Tech\u2019s earnings season kicks off next week with a flurry of announcements from some of the industry\u2019s most important players including Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT). With the new year well under way, and AI still the hottest ticket in Silicon Valley, you can expect plenty of conversations about how companies are monetizing the technology and how much they spend on capital expenditures related to constructing data centers and producing new AI models.\n\nAnd looming over all of that will be how newly-inaugurated President Trump will impact tech\u2019s biggest trend in years. Whether it\u2019s tougher tariffs, export controls, or more relaxed antitrust regulations, Big Tech will be keeping a close eye on Washington. And investors are certain to want to know what that means for companies\u2019 bottom lines.\n\nTrump already made his mark on the AI scene on Tuesday, announcing Stargate, a $500 billion AI data center company headed by Softbank, OpenAI, and Oracle (ORCL) that will see the trio construct data centers to power AI projects within the U.S.\n\nIt\u2019s all going to make for quite an interesting earnings season, and it kicks off with Meta and Microsoft on Wednesday.\n\nThe Trump factor\n\nInvestors and analysts will want to know how companies are working with the administration to ensure they don\u2019t end up on the wrong end of Trump\u2019s proposed tariffs on goods from China.\n\nApple (AAPL), whose CEO Tim Cook has a good relationship with the president, avoided tariffs during the first Trump administration and will look to do so this time around, as well. Amazon (AMZN), Apple, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Meta, and Microsoft could also see less regulation around antitrust matters and a return to mergers and acquisitions.(L-R) Priscilla Chan, Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, Lauren Sanchez, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Tesla CEO Elon Musk attend the inauguration of Donald Trump on January 20, 2025. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\u00b7Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images\n\nThere\u2019s also the fate of the CHIPS Act. The legislation, passed under the Biden administration is meant to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the US. But Trump has criticized the law, which provides billions in funding to chip makers, saying it was \u201cso bad\u201d during an appearance on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast ahead of the election.\n\nWithout the cash, Intel (INTC), TSMC, Samsung, and a slew of other semiconductor companies may not be able to complete their ambitious plans to build new chip making facilities. Look for word on how the likes of Intel and its competitors are navigating the new administration and whether it\u2019s heard how it plans to address the CHIPS Act.\n\nAI revenue and spending\n\nIn addition to Trump, you can guarantee that virtually every tech company will mention AI revenue and spending. According to Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, Microsoft should report improved AI consumption and continued spending, something investors have been hoping for as the company works to meet customer demand for AI infrastructure.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring its prior quarter, Microsoft reported better than anticipated overall revenue and cloud and AI sales. But that wasn\u2019t enough to satisfy investors, sending the company\u2019s stock sinking 5% the day after the report.\n\nMeta\u2019s stock suffered a similar setback following its earnings last quarter, with shares falling after the company announced full-year 2024 cap-ex spending would increase from $37-$40 billion to $38-$40 billion.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AMZN)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nGoogle and Amazon, on the other hand, won over investors with Google beating expectations on cloud revenue and Amazon improving overall margins.\n\nMicrosoft shares are up just 12% over the last 12 months, lagging the broader S&P 500, which rose 25% during the period. Amazon and Google shares are up 50% and 34%, respectively, while shares of Meta have climbed 64%.\n\nTikTok\u2019s clock gets a reset\n\nOne of the biggest issues for Meta and Google is what Trump will do with TikTok. Both companies stand to gain users and advertising dollars if the short-form video app is banned in the US. But Trump is working with TikTok CEO Shou Chew to find a way to keep the app up and running, despite a law calling for it to go offline.\n\nIf Trump and TikTok can\u2019t find a solution, the app might bite the dust, leaving its 170 million users, and the advertisers that want to reach them, with no place to turn than competing apps like Instagram and YouTube, which would be a boon for both companies.\n\nBut with Trump proclaiming that he\u2019d \u201csave\u201d TikTok on the campaign trail, it will be hard for him to back away from keeping the app afloat. We'll see what TikTok's rivals have to say, if anything, beginning next week.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Apple's strong relationship with Trump may mitigate concerns over tariffs, which could positively affect investor sentiment. However, the overall market reaction to earnings reports from peers like Microsoft and Meta, which have seen mixed results, could create volatility. Given the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and their potential impact on the tech sector, there is a balanced outlook for Apple's stock. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the favorable relationship with the administration and the ongoing AI trend, but also acknowledge the risk of a fall due to market reactions to earnings and broader economic factors."

On one hand, Tim Cook's good relationship with President Trump could help Apple avoid tariffs, which would be positive. The potential for relaxed antitrust regulations could also benefit Apple, allowing for more M&A activity. However, uncertainty surrounding the CHIPS Act and its potential impact on the semiconductor industry, which is crucial for Apple's products, introduces a negative element. The article also highlights the importance of AI revenue and spending, which will be a key focus for investors. While Apple is expected to discuss its AI strategy, the market's reaction will depend on whether the company can demonstrate a clear path to monetization and meet investor expectations. The potential impact of Trump's stance on TikTok is less directly relevant to Apple compared to Meta and Google, but could still have some indirect effects on the competitive landscape. Overall, the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and the need for Apple to demonstrate strong AI progress make it difficult to predict the stock's movement with high confidence. Given the potential for both positive and negative outcomes, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall due to the uncertainty and the high expectations surrounding AI."

Uncertainty around the CHIPS Act and its impact on the semiconductor industry introduces further risk.  Previous predictions show a consensus leaning slightly towards a price rise, but with significant uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals, market volatility, and the previous predictions which show a slight but consistent bias towards a price increase, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect this uncertainty. The slight upward trend in previous predictions, coupled with Apple's generally strong position and Cook's relationship with Trump, suggests a slightly higher probability of a price rise. However, the risks associated with AI performance, regulatory changes, and the CHIPS Act remain substantial.  The overall uncertainty and the relatively consistent predictions from various models suggest a probability close to 50/50, with a slight lean towards a rise due to the existing positive relationship between Apple's CEO and the President and the ongoing importance of AI in the tech sector."

                    "reasoning": "The financial news indicates that Apple Inc. is facing a UK probe into its mobile ecosystems and operating systems. This regulatory scrutiny has historically led to negative impacts on tech stocks due to potential increased costs, legal liabilities, or restrictions on business practices. While Apple has strong market resilience, the immediate negative implications of regulatory scrutiny tend to weigh heavily on investor sentiment. Previous predictions from various models suggest a general consensus towards a higher probability of a stock price decline. Considering these factors, the estimated probability of a stock price rise is low, while the probability of a decline is higher."

However, they express concern about overall market valuation and believe AI stocks offer better and faster returns. The article also mentions a recent one-month return of -13.59% for Apple, which is a negative signal. While the 52-week gain of 15.28% is positive, the fund's preference for AI stocks and the recent negative performance suggest potential downward pressure. The decrease in hedge fund holdings from 184 to 158 also indicates a potential shift in sentiment. The mention of 'disappointing data' and 'expensive stock' further supports a cautious outlook. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise."

Their lower-than-average market exposure and the mention of Apple being 'pretty expensive' (from a cited source) suggest a bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  Although Apple's revenue showed growth, the hedge fund's reduced position and preference for AI investments outweigh the positive revenue news.

The negative one-month return (-13.59%) and the characterization of AAPL as 'pretty expensive' further support this negative sentiment. Although Apple's revenue is up and it remains a holding for many hedge funds, the weight of the negative factors, particularly the explicit preference for AI investments and valuation concerns, outweighs the positive signals.  The consensus among previous models also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  Therefore, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledge the possibility of a rise given Apple's overall strength and continued institutional interest."

Last week, Jefferies analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance.\n\nShares of Apple were up 0.25% Wednesday morning, after closing at $223.83 Tuesday.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d Following Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies also said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March.\n\nThis slide in stock price caused chipmaker Nvidia to overtake Apple as the most valuable company in the world on Tuesday.\n\nBut analysts at Wedbush said that overall unit declines in China are \u201cmanageable,\u201d and that investors will get a better understanding of Apple\u2019s China turnaround once it announces its regional AI partner, which will likely be Baidu (BIDU). Tencent (TCEHY) and ByteDance are also in the running, Ives said.\n\nAs a result, the securities firm maintained its \u201cOutperform\u201d rating and $325 price target\n\n\u201cWith Apple Intelligence being rolled out in a phased strategy the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle is the start of a massive growth renaissance at Apple and that bull thesis remains intact as we see ~20% of the world\u2019s population ultimately accessing AI through an Apple device over the coming years,\u201d Ives wrote.\n\nAlthough Jefferies and others have raised concerns about Apple\u2019s AI strategy, which came late in the game compared with competitors and is being rolled out in phases through the tech giant\u2019s latest models, Ives believes 2025 will be a \u201cfork in the road year\u201d for Apple.\n\n\u201cRome wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither will Apple\u2019s AI strategy,\u201d Ives said. \u201cbut the seeds of that strategy with Apple Intelligence are now forming and will transform the Apple consumer growth narrative over the coming years.\u201d\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments",

This suggests downward pressure. On the other hand, Wedbush maintains an \"Outperform\" rating with a significantly higher price target ($325 vs. current $223.83), believes the market is overreacting, and sees a \"massive growth renaissance\" driven by Apple Intelligence and the iPhone 16 upgrade cycle. The key positive catalyst is the potential AI partnership in China. The phrase \"fork in the road year\" suggests significant uncertainty. Given the conflicting analyst opinions and the potential for a positive catalyst (AI partnership), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the significant risks."

Jefferies downgrades Apple due to weak iPhone sales expectations and concerns about the AI strategy rollout.  However, Wedbush maintains a positive outlook, highlighting manageable China unit declines, the potential for a significant AI partnership, and the long-term growth potential of Apple Intelligence.  The disagreement between these reputable firms suggests significant uncertainty. While the short-term outlook appears bearish due to immediate sales concerns, the long-term potential of AI integration and the Wedbush's bullish price target of $325 (significantly higher than the current price) suggest a higher probability of a price rise in the medium to long term.  The current market reaction is mixed, with a slight upward movement after a recent drop.

Additionally, Nvidia overtook Apple as the most valuable company. However, Wedbush analysts remain optimistic, citing an 'overdone' bear frenzy and maintaining an 'Outperform' rating with a $325 price target. They highlight potential growth from Apple's AI strategy (Apple Intelligence) and a phased rollout starting with the iPhone 16, along with a manageable decline in China sales and a potential regional AI partnership (e.g., Baidu).

However, analysts at Wedbush maintain an 'Outperform' rating and a $325 price target, citing the potential for Apple's AI strategy to drive growth in the coming years. The article also mentions that the decline in stock price is attributed to expectations of weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales, but Wedbush believes that overall unit declines in China are 'manageable'. Considering these factors, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling, as the long-term potential of Apple's AI strategy and the company's ability to adapt to changing market conditions may outweigh the short-term concerns."

Given the mixed signals and the long-term growth potential, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising."

Considering the previous rounds of predictions, which show a slight bullish bias that has been decreasing, and the conflicting analyst opinions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the significant risks.

Nvidia surpassing Apple in market capitalization further reinforces this negative sentiment.  However, Wedbush's strong \"Outperform\" rating and significantly higher price target ($325) suggest strong belief in Apple's long-term potential, particularly driven by its AI strategy. The \"fork in the road year\" description highlights significant uncertainty.  Analyzing the previous predictions, there's a slight bullish bias, but conflicting opinions and inherent uncertainty warrant caution. The short-term outlook is bearish due to immediate sales concerns, but the long-term potential of AI integration and Wedbush's bullish price target suggest a higher probability of a price rise in the medium to long term.  The slight upward movement in the stock price immediately following the news is also a factor.  Considering the balance of these factors, and the trend of slightly decreasing bullishness in previous prediction rounds, a probability slightly above 0.5 for a price rise seems appropriate, acknowledging significant uncertainty.  The consistent slight bullishness across multiple models, despite the negative short-term outlook, suggests a belief in the long-term potential of Apple's AI strategy outweighing current sales concerns."

        "headline": "Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation \u2013 Here\u2019s Why",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses TikTok Ban, President Trump & These 6 Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer maintained his view that President Trump and his administration will be quite pro-business. Commenting on Trump\u2019s statements at his inauguration, Cramer started out by saying, \u201cI think that, regardless, it\u2019s a very pro-business regime.\u201d He explained that his view came despite \u201ca story that the FT just ran about Donald Trump threatening tax wherever US multinationals [are].\u201d According to Cramer, the story \u201cis the only thing I have heard so far that just tells me, you could one day raise numbers. I think it\u2019s important, David because we live in a raise numbers, decline numbers world.\u201d\n\nAs to Trump\u2019s policies, one shift that caught his attention was the President\u2019s aim to invigorate the American oil production industry. \u201cWell look I think that the only substantive stuff from the market is that prices for oil are going to go down \u2019cause he\u2019s going to get us to pump more,\u201d Cramer outlined. \u201cAnd I think that the discipline of the oil companies versus what he said, could be, that\u2019s front and center,\u201d he added. However, Cramer cautioned that \u201c[t]he oil companies are not into drilling all over the place. They realize that their stocks had kind of a housing moment because they held back. And now they\u2019re being told, drill. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll respond to that. I just don\u2019t think that they will.\u201d\n\nContinuing his remarks on the US energy industry, he shifted his focus to the gas sector. Cramer believes that America needs \u201cmore pipe[line], we\u2019re out of pipe[line] to send the natural gas from the Permian.\u201d He outlined that President Trump \u201cbasically undid that January pause about building new facilities for natural gas.\u201d Cramer believes that the move was necessary \u201c[b]ecause a lot of projects, longer-term projects got halted. They will come back. But we don\u2019t have a lot of what\u2019s known as trains. We don\u2019t have enough car loads to be able to ship as much natural gas . . . it just looks like, that you can\u2019t ship more, as long as you don\u2019t have a lot of, facilities. And we don\u2019t have enough facilities to ship. And that does matter.\u201d\n\nHowever, one thing from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech that surprised Cramer was his take on China. \u201cSo far China kind of got off the hook,\u201d he believes. This apparently relaxed attitude towards China also might have led to markets performing well, with Cramer stating, \u201c[a]nd I think that\u2019s another reason that people are pretty buoyant.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nAnother aspect of the new administration that has caught investor and public attention is the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE. Headed by Elon Musk, the department aims to reduce purported wasteful spending in the US government. Cramer believes DOGE has its work cut out. According to him, \u201c[r]ight now DOGE sounds like, we\u2019re going to put some guys in. They\u2019re going to make a difference. It doesn\u2019t work like that. I mean, well the deep swamp, well, it\u2019s the deep state. But you know what I\u2019m saying is that the swamp is hard to clear with just four guys.\u201d\n\nHowever, the CNBC host does believe that the tech sector could modernize the government\u2019s operations. \u201cIt could be. I mean take a look at all the hacking. When you speak to cybersecurity people, they say, look the technology is many years old. They didn\u2019t keep up,\u201d he shared.\n\nHe also commented on President Biden and how he stood out when it came to wealth. \u201cWhen the previous president got it . . . .there was no billionaires for Biden. He was not into that,\u201d Cramer shared. According to him, \u201c[h]e [Biden] wasn\u2019t into hundred millionaires. . . . he didn\u2019t like em. He didn\u2019t like them, he felt that they represented the wrong stream of thought in America. That\u2019s just what he did. He was also very proud of how poor he was. Which is a very, which is anomalous. We do not have a lot of people who are proud of being poor!\u201d\n\nShifting gears, Cramer then commented on the ongoing saga of TikTok\u2019s ban in the US. While the application is still banned, it has been granted a temporary reprieve by the President as he attempts to reach a solution that balances national security with a popular software application. Cramer shared that the Supreme Court\u2019s decision upholding the Protecting Americans Against Foreign Adversaries Act (PAFCA) was quite unique. According to him, \u201c[t]hey handed down, the only time I\u2019ve ever seen it, one hundred percent. One hundred percent agreement. Everybody.\u201d He added according to the court\u2019s opinion, it was clear that \u201cthere is a huge national security risk.\u201d\n\nWhen co-host David Faber countered and claimed that the court had simply agreed with Congress, Cramer replied, \u201cRight, but I\u2019m saying Bill [Bill Ford of General Atlantic] would be contrary to the, one of the few times that the court was unanimous about national security risk.\u201d Cramer backed his argument by outlining the kinds of user data that TikTok collects. He explained, \u201c[b]y the way, if you look at what they get from you when you sign up.\u00a0 Now, I\u2019m not close to Joe Rogan. I listened to Mark Zuckerberg talk about hunting with Joe, but Joe did read, he did read down what you give them when you sign up. And you give them, everything. Everything. They have access to everything.\u201d\n\nHe also commented on whether there\u2019s a backdoor for access despite the data being hosted in the US. \u201cThere is! The Supreme Court says it\u2019s not even a backdoor. Supreme Court basically says it\u2019s a front door,\u201d Cramer believes. He added, \u201cI think they went a step further. I think that Chief Justice Roberts basically just said this is a Manchurian candidate. He didn\u2019t use that term, but he meant it.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 21st.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

(see more details here).Jim Cramer Thinks Apple Inc. (AAPL) Will Miss Earnings, Despite AI Innovation - Here's Why\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nConsumer electronics and technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another stock that\u2019s regularly on Cramer\u2019s radar. Most of his remarks this year have revolved around social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s remarks that innovation had ended at Apple since Steve Jobs\u2019 death and around the upcoming earnings. Cramer disagrees with Zuckerberg\u2019s assessment, and his latest comments about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) tied his beliefs about the upcoming earnings with recent analyst coverage:\n\n\u201cApple\u2019s gonna miss big. I mean I can\u2019t believe that anyone is still around who thinks that they haven\u2019t guided down enough. I mean the new one obviously is that the quarter\u2019s going to be bad but wait till you see the guidance. It\u2019s really. . . .I mean AI\u2019s not working and everyone is missing the fact China orders have plummeted, everyone, I mean you could go on the subway, like David does, and ask the average person how\u2019s Apple gonna do. And they\u2019re gonna say it. They\u2019re gonna miss. You know if everybody thinks something is a surprise, it\u2019s not a surprise! Okay. They\u2019re acting like it\u2019s, they\u2019re acting like it\u2019s the Commanders.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article also highlights the widespread negative sentiment surrounding Apple's performance, suggesting a consensus view of an earnings miss.  This negative outlook from a prominent financial commentator, coupled with the general expectation of poor performance, increases the likelihood of a negative market reaction.  However, it's important to note that Cramer's predictions are not always accurate, and the market's reaction can be unpredictable.  Therefore, while the probability of a price fall is higher, a price rise is still possible due to other market factors or unexpected positive news."

While Cramer's predictions aren't always accurate, the consensus view and the specific negative catalysts mentioned warrant a bearish outlook.

(AAPL), predicting that the company will miss its earnings expectations due to weak China orders and underperformance of AI initiatives. Cramer's influence and the negative tone of the analysis suggest a short-term negative impact on investor sentiment. The consensus view from previous predictions, ranging from 0.2 to 0.3 for a rise and 0.7 to 0.8 for a fall, indicates a strong bearish sentiment among analysts. Given the weight of Cramer's statements and the lack of positive counterarguments, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

The repeated negative sentiment from credible sources and the lack of positive counterarguments in the news indicate a strong likelihood of a negative market reaction."
