        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven,\" comprising Nvidia (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Tesla (TSLA), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Apple (AAPL), is in focus amid Big Tech earnings after news from Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, DeepSeek, fueled Monday's tech sell-off.\n\nHarvard Law professor Mihir Desai sits down with Market Domination co-hosts Julie Hyman and Josh Lipton to explain why he compares Big Tech to a snake eating its own tail and what that means for investors.\n\n\"This is a really colorful metaphor that's been around forever of a snake eating its own tail, and I used it just to try to understand the most interesting puzzle of the day, which is: How can seven companies constitute more than a third of the market capitalization?\" Desai shares.\n\nHe notes that while there are multiple possible explanations for the phenomenon, he believes that the \"Magnificent Seven is being viewed as a safe asset.\"\n\nDesai elaborates, \"For investors around the world, they think to themselves: In a world of uncertainty, who do I trust? And the answer is Big Tech.\" Related Videos\n\n04:43\n\nDeepSeek's AI shakeup: Why Big Tech won\u2019t cut spending\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 18 hours ago 07:19\n\nDeepSeek could put 'cold water' on utilities sector growth\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 19 hours ago 04:57\n\nWhy timing of DeepSeek's AI release was 'interesting'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 22 hours ago 23:43\n\nAI trade in 2024, DeepSeek's crypto impact: Asking for a Trend\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago\n\n\"The problem with that, of course, is once you view them as a safe asset, then your expected returns go down, and managers there have been doing what you would expect them to do, which is with a really low cost of capital, they've been spending money like crazy and literally on each other and on themselves,\" he adds. \"And that is a serpent eating its own tail, which is just a way of saying they've been spending money on each other.\"\n\nDesai explains that this phenomenon will result in \"pretty low returns.\"\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

However, it also highlights concerns about low expected returns due to excessive spending among these companies. This duality suggests that while there may be some investor confidence in Apple as a safe asset, the overall sentiment regarding low returns could lead to a cautious approach from investors. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is also significant due to the concerns raised."

                    "reasoning": "The news headline and content present a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While the 'Magnificent Seven' are seen as safe assets, which could be a positive for Apple's stock, the article also suggests that this perception leads to lower expected returns and companies spending money on each other, potentially resulting in 'pretty low returns'. The mention of DeepSeek's AI and its potential impact on the tech sector introduces uncertainty. Overall, the news leans slightly negative due to the concerns about low returns and the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor, but the 'safe asset' perception provides some support. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise."

Professor Desai's 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor highlights the internal competition and overspending within Big Tech, leading to potentially low returns. While Apple is considered a safe asset, this implies lower expected returns, suggesting a decreased likelihood of significant price increases. The overall market sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's AI advancements further contributes to a bearish sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, although the impact is likely to be moderate given Apple's established position."

This metaphor implies that the market may be overvaluing these companies as 'safe assets,' potentially leading to investor skepticism. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified product portfolio could mitigate some negative sentiment. The mention of a tech sell-off fueled by news from a Chinese AI startup adds uncertainty, but Apple's specific impact is unclear."

(AAPL), and how their dominance may lead to low returns due to their high spending on each other and themselves, likened to a 'snake eating its own tail.' This metaphor suggests a self-sustaining but potentially stagnant or declining growth cycle. The comparison of these companies to a safe asset with expected low returns may lead investors to be cautious or reduce their expectations for future growth, potentially resulting in a stock price decrease."

This phenomenon is likened to a snake eating its own tail, implying that the growth of these companies may be limited. Given this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling, as the article suggests that the 'Magnificent Seven' companies, including Apple, may experience low returns."

While this might initially attract investment due to perceived safety, Professor Mihir Desai suggests that this could lead to low returns as these companies spend excessively on themselves and each other, akin to a 'snake eating its own tail'. This scenario implies that investors may not see substantial gains, which could dampen investor sentiment."

The 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor emphasizes this unsustainable growth model.  The previous predictions consistently show a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, ranging from 0.55 to 0.7.  The consensus leans towards a bearish sentiment, primarily driven by concerns about low returns and the overall tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's AI advancements.  While Apple's strong brand and diversified portfolio offer some resilience, the prevailing negative sentiment regarding low returns and the potential for continued market uncertainty outweighs the 'safe asset' perception.

Apple and Meta are competitors in some areas (e.g., mobile devices, advertising), but the news doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or competitive landscape in a significant way.  A strong showing by a competitor doesn't automatically translate to negative news for Apple.  The market's reaction might be muted, with a slight possibility of a negative correlation if investors reallocate funds from other tech companies to Meta, but this is unlikely to be a major factor.

Although this indicates strong performance in the tech sector, it primarily affects Meta Platforms. The news does not have a direct impact on Apple Inc. However, there could be some indirect effects due to the increased competition in areas like AI and augmented reality. The probabilities are influenced by the fact that investors might react positively to the tech sector's growth while being cautious about increased competition for Apple. The trend from previous predictions leans towards a slightly negative impact, with a high probability of a fall due to competitive pressures."

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)) stands against other best consumer electronics stocks to invest in now.\n\nThe global consumer electronics market has seen significant growth, reaching a valuation of $755 billion in 2024, with projections to hit $1.15 trillion by 2031, according to Research and Markets. This growth is driven by rising demand for innovative devices that enhance convenience. Consumer electronics, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and connected home devices, have transformed how people live, work, and connect.\n\nContinuous innovation also keeps the industry competitive, with companies focused on attracting consumer interest. Despite global economic challenges, the market remains resilient, driven by advancements in AI. In 2023, smartphone shipments reached about 1.2 billion units, reinforcing this category\u2019s profitability. The market is projected to grow to $1.13 trillion by 2025, with a 3% annual growth rate. North America, particularly the US, is at the forefront of the consumer electronics market, leading globally in terms of adoption and demand. The region is expected to maintain this leadership due to its swift embrace of cutting-edge technologies. In the US, the fast-paced lifestyle increasingly revolves around digital solutions, with automation becoming a key priority.\n\nTim Seymour, Seymour Asset Management CIO, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on January 18 to signify upcoming events and how they might correlate with current market dynamics. Seymour notes that the tech sector, which includes consumer electronics, has rallied under President Trump, creating a favorable hiring environment. He believes that at least half of the MAG7 stocks have defensible valuations. Regarding tariffs, he suggests that consumer-centered sectors, like consumer electronics, will be impacted first, with reports indicating that tariffs could negatively affect the economy, as highlighted by the World Bank and IMF.\n\nDiscussing the economic implications of tariffs, Seymour expressed skepticism about tax increases while acknowledging uncertainty around reductions. He reflected on the tariffs imposed against China in 2018 and 2019, which impacted manufacturing, including consumer electronics. While tariffs may hinder growth, he noted that a strong dollar could enhance the competitiveness of US products abroad. Seymour focused on tech companies with solid valuations for their growth potential. Large MNCs in consumer electronics may perform better with upcoming announcements and are less vulnerable to strategic influences than smaller firms. While he is cautious about growth scares overshadowing inflationary pressures in 2025, he maintains a positive sentiment overall.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top consumer electronics stocks. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a tech giant known for its innovative consumer electronics products. Its popular products include iPhones, Mac computers, iPad tablets, and wearables like Apple Watches and AirPods. It also provides an ecosystem of services like app stores, streaming services, and cloud solutions, which enhance the user experience across its entire product line.\n\nRecent years have witnessed a slowdown in iPhone sales growth. But the company\u2019s investments in AI, showcased by the recent introduction of Apple Intelligence, will reignite growth. Apple Intelligence, which is a suite of AI-powered tools and services integrated into the iPhone, assists users with tasks like email composition, notification summarization, and appointment scheduling.\n\nFollowing its launch of Apple Intelligence, Rosenblatt Securities maintained a Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a $262 target price on January 27. This was despite concerns about disappointing iPhone performance in the December quarter, echoed by UBS. While Apple Intelligence and upcoming software updates hold promise for future growth, intense competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, which offer advanced AI and aggressive pricing, poses a significant challenge. The company experienced a 7.7% sales drop in China in FY24. This decline came from competition from domestic brands and a sluggish Chinese economy. To mitigate this, it\u2019s shifting its focus from hardware sales towards revenue streams like its App Store services.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of best consumer electronics stocks to invest in now. As we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

He believes Apple controls its own future. However, the article also suggests that AI stocks might offer better returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone leans slightly negative in the short term due to the anticipated disappointment, but positive in the long term due to Apple's fundamentals. Given the conflicting signals, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall in the immediate aftermath of the earnings report, but not overwhelmingly so, as Cramer's advice to hold could mitigate the negative impact. The long-term outlook remains positive, but this analysis focuses on the immediate reaction to the news."

He anticipates negative news regarding Chinese sales, AI integration, service revenue, Vision Pro sales, and a lowered forecast.  While he advises against short-term trading and recommends holding the stock long-term due to Apple's strong management and product quality, his overwhelmingly negative prediction for the earnings report strongly suggests a potential near-term price drop.  The article also highlights that Cramer's focus has shifted towards AI stocks, implying a relative lack of confidence in Apple's immediate prospects compared to other sectors.  However, the fact that he still recommends holding the stock long-term suggests the negative impact might be temporary and not catastrophic.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is assigned a higher value than a price rise, but not an extreme value, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in market reactions and Cramer's own mixed message."

        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nDeepSeek has caused a permanent reset in how AI development will unfold in coming years.\n\nAt least that's the take from Snowflake (SNOW) CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, whose data storage company provides technology used by companies developing large language models like DeepSeek and ChatGPT.\n\n\"So what this [news] basically does is two things. One, it says there's still a lot of innovation left and many companies can aspire to train these models. But, two, it also raises the really interesting question of do you need to spend billions of dollars in order to train cutting-edge, world-class models? I think the jury is still out there for things like that, but it's basically upended our assumptions about where AI is going,\" Ramaswamy told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDeepSeek is a Chinese company that has burst onto the tech landscape seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nLast week, it surprised more than just markets after unveiling RI, its AI model that gave a ChatGPT-esque performance at an arguably cheaper price tag. RI costs a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nWatch: Why billionaire investor Ray Dalio is concerned about tech valuations\n\nFears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia (NVDA) chips.\n\nIn response, stocks went haywire on Monday. Nvidia\u2019s market value dropped by $588.8 billion, or 16.97%. It was the biggest ever single-day loss in a stock\u2019s market cap in absolute terms, according to Deutsche Bank data. Monday's decline for Nvidia was larger than the total market cap of Exxon or Mastercard.\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia has persisted into Wednesday, with shares down 4.5%. The AI darling has seen its stock tank 11% so far this year.\n\n\"DeepSeek model suggests the cost of training GenAI models is set to decline substantially \u2026 which we see leading to faster gen-AI product innovation and availability,\" Morgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak said in a note.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nDeepSeek just revealed a huge risk to the stock market Billionaire Ray Dalio offers fresh tips on how to be a better investor Another bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini\n\nNowak stayed upbeat on Microsoft (MSFT) despite its investment exposure to OpenAI.\n\nInterestingly, Nowak thinks Apple's stock could be a winner as fears about DeepSeek's impact weigh on the Magnificent Seven names.\n\n\"Apple's AI ambitions are far more contained than the majority of the Mag 7 (or other frontier model developers), as Apple is currently focused on smaller, function-specific, on-device LLM's, rather than large frontier models. As a result, Apple's annual capex ($9.4B in FY24) is about 1/20th the scale of the US Tier 1 hyperscalers combined, and therefore if the market hyper-focuses on capex ROI, the threshold for Apple to deliver an attractive return is far lower (i.e. less risk) than the T1 hyperscalers,\" explained Nowak.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy thinks investors need to be on high alert for more developments out of DeepSeek rivals in China.\n\n\"Even the fact that they were able to do this coming out of nowhere is a wake-up call again, that there's lots of innovation to go and many people should be trying it,\" said Ramaswamy.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

However, Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple's more contained AI ambitions, focusing on smaller, on-device LLMs, make it less vulnerable to the capex ROI concerns impacting other tech giants. This 'less risk' narrative could attract investors seeking safer bets within the tech sector. The overall market sentiment towards AI and tech stocks is currently volatile, as evidenced by Nvidia's significant market cap loss. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of Apple's stock price rising due to this news, as investors may see it as a relatively safer haven compared to companies heavily invested in large-scale AI models. However, the overall market uncertainty and potential for broader tech sector downturn limit the upside potential."

Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak highlights that Apple's lower capital expenditure makes it less vulnerable to the concerns raised by DeepSeek's advancements. Considering the mixed signals in the market, with a consensus leaning towards a more positive outlook for Apple, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling. The trend of previous predictions also indicates a growing belief that Apple will benefit from the situation, with a slight increase in the probability of a stock price rise in each round."

Analysts suggest that Apple's AI strategy, which focuses on smaller, on-device models, positions it more favorably compared to its peers. Morgan Stanley's analyst Brian Nowak specifically notes that Apple's lower capital expenditure requirements make it less risky compared to other tech giants heavily invested in large-scale AI models. Multiple predictions from previous rounds consistently indicate a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising due to its strategic positioning."

        "content": "Apple (AAPL, Financials) was downgraded to Perform from Outperform by Oppenheimer ahead of its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings report, with analysts citing slowing iPhone sales and competitive pressures in China.\n\nPointing to a reduced iPhone sales forecast over the next 12 to 18 months, the investment group also eliminated its $250 price estimate on the shares. Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term performance. The concerns about slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market, and the absence of compelling AI applications are significant headwinds. The 25% and 17% drop in Apple exports to China in recent quarters further reinforces the negative outlook. While earnings are scheduled to be released soon, the downgrade suggests that Oppenheimer anticipates disappointing results or guidance, increasing the likelihood of a stock price decline. The elimination of the $250 price target is also a strong negative signal. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise."

While the market may have already partially priced in some negative sentiment, the downgrade itself is a strong negative catalyst. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial, but the pre-announcement negative news increases the probability of the report confirming or even worsening the concerns.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise in the short term.  However, it's important to note that Apple is a large, established company, and the market reaction might be less dramatic than for a smaller, more volatile company.

While Apple's earnings report could offer a positive surprise, the pre-announcement negative news significantly increases the likelihood of the report confirming or worsening the concerns.  The elimination of the $250 price target is also a strong negative signal.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Safest Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other safe stocks.\n\nHedge funds, known for their sophisticated investment strategies and ability to generate returns across market cycles, have a complex performance history. Since their inception in 1949, hedge funds have evolved significantly, with returns varying widely by strategy, market conditions, and the broader economic environment. The first hedge fund was created by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, combining long and short equity positions to hedge against market risk. During the 1950s and 1960s, hedge funds gained attention for their ability to outperform traditional mutual funds. Jones\u2019s fund reportedly generated returns of approximately 20% annually in its early years, setting a precedent for the industry.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were challenging due to high inflation, stagflation, and the oil crisis, but some hedge funds excelled by capitalizing on macroeconomic trends. Macro-focused funds like those led by George Soros delivered impressive returns by making bold bets on currencies and commodities. For example, Soros famously earned $1 billion in 1992 by shorting the British pound. The 1990s were a golden era for hedge funds, marked by rapid industry growth and strong performance. The average annual return of hedge funds during this period was approximately 15%, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Managers benefited from a booming stock market, globalization, and the rise of new asset classes.\n\nNotable successes included Tiger Management, led by Julian Robertson, and Renaissance Technologies, whose Medallion Fund achieved annualized returns exceeding 30%. The 2000s were a mixed decade for hedge funds. The early 2000s saw strong performance during the dot-com crash, as many funds profited from short positions in overvalued tech stocks. Between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 43%, while hedge funds, on average, delivered positive annualized returns of around 6%. However, the 2008 financial crisis tested the industry. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index declined by 19% in 2008, its worst annual performance on record. However, since the 2010s, there has been a prolonged bull market, barring minor blips during the pandemic, during which hedge funds have shined relative to other investment vehicles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company offers a robust investment case for several reasons. Apple has achieved 11 consecutive years of dividend growth, exceeding the sector median of 1.7 years by 555%, reflecting its commitment to consistently increasing shareholder returns. The company is also planning to launch a new low-cost iPhone, a refreshed low-cost iPad, and an M4 MacBook Air. The iPhone SE, the company\u2019s first device with an Apple 5G modem, will see an update in 2025, and it is expected to feature a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, and an iPhone 14-like design. It will be the first Apple device with an Apple 5G modem. Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on an 11th-generation iPad with a faster chip and support for Wi-Fi 6E.

Considering the overall positive sentiment, strong fundamentals, the trend of previous predictions, and the inherent volatility of the stock market, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise, but acknowledging the potential for other investment opportunities. The slight increase in the probability of a rise across the prediction rounds reflects a strengthening of the positive sentiment.  The consensus among the previous models, showing a gradual increase in the probability of a price rise over multiple rounds, strengthens the confidence in a positive outlook.  Therefore, I'm slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the latest round of predictions."

So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The cited data from Canalys showing significant declines in iPhone shipments to China reinforces these concerns. While the article mentions upcoming Q1 earnings, the overall tone suggests that these earnings may not be strong enough to offset the negative factors. The fact that the stock dipped in morning trading after the news broke is also indicative of negative market reaction. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise."

The cited 25% drop in Q4 iPhone shipments to China is significant.  While the upcoming earnings report could offer a counter-narrative, the pre-earnings downgrade and lowered revenue/EPS forecasts significantly increase the likelihood of a negative market reaction. The mention of increased competition and a lack of compelling AI applications further fuels the bearish sentiment.

The previous rounds of predictions overwhelmingly favor a stock price decline, reflecting the negative sentiment surrounding the company's near-term prospects. While the upcoming earnings report could offer a surprise, the pre-earnings downgrade and negative data points make a positive outcome less likely.

                    "reasoning": "The overwhelming consensus across multiple rounds of predictions from various AI models points towards a significantly higher probability of Apple's stock price falling.  The primary driver is Oppenheimer's downgrade, a reputable firm, coupled with substantial concerns regarding slowing iPhone sales, particularly the dramatic decline in the crucial Chinese market (a 25% drop in Q4 alone).  Reduced revenue and EPS forecasts further reinforce this bearish sentiment. While the upcoming earnings report could theoretically offer a positive surprise, the pre-earnings negative sentiment and lowered expectations make this unlikely. The consistent bearish trend across multiple prediction rounds, and the fact that the stock dipped slightly after the news broke, strongly suggests that the market has already partially priced in the negative news.  The lack of compelling AI applications also adds to the negative outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considerably higher than a price rise, even considering the potential for a positive earnings surprise.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple models and rounds strengthens the prediction of a higher probability of a price fall."

        "content": "DeepSeek, China's latest AI chatbot, is causing concern among Silicon Valley investors. The company claims to have developed a Chinese chatbot at a significantly lower cost than US tech companies, raising questions about the implications for US companies investing heavily in AI development.\n\n\"I still think this is a fairly substantial engineering feat that experts have examined, and they found that these... very young Chinese engineers have done a great job at optimizing and working around constraints in a way that oftentimes we in the West don't, and we throw additional money at it and make these models very expensive,\" Cambrian.ai Co-Founder and CEO Olaf Groth tells Catalysts host Seana Smith.\n\nWhile Groth believes DeepSeek's emergence will be \"good for the market overall,\" he notes that from a geopolitical perspective, it could escalate national security concerns.\n\n\"Open source models that generate a lot of data in the United States, then spreading that much more effectively, that data going to Chinese servers will become an issue at even greater scale,\" he warns.

On one hand, the emergence of a potentially cheaper and efficient AI chatbot from China (DeepSeek) could be seen as a competitive threat, potentially impacting Apple's future AI investments and market share. This could lead to a negative sentiment among investors. However, the article also highlights the potential for geopolitical concerns and data security issues related to Chinese AI, which could indirectly benefit US tech companies like Apple as they are perceived as more secure and compliant with Western data privacy standards. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative in the short term due to the increased competition, but the long-term implications are uncertain. The market's reaction will depend on how investors weigh the competitive threat against the geopolitical and data security concerns. Given the mixed signals, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall."

This raises concerns about data security and potential geopolitical risks. However, the news does not directly impact Apple's business or financial performance.  Apple's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by this news, as the connection between a Chinese AI chatbot and Apple's operations is tenuous.

The reasons cited are increased competition in China and a perceived lack of compelling AI features. These are significant concerns for a company like Apple, as China is a major market and AI is a key area of growth and innovation. A downgrade from 'Outperform' to 'Perform' suggests that Oppenheimer no longer expects Apple to outperform the market. This negative sentiment, coupled with the timing just before earnings, increases the likelihood of a stock price decline. However, the actual earnings report could still surprise positively, mitigating the negative impact. The market's reaction will also depend on the specific details and guidance provided during the earnings call. Given the negative pre-earnings sentiment, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall."

The cited reasons \u2013 increased competition in China and a lack of compelling AI features \u2013 are significant concerns for investors.  While Apple's earnings report could potentially offset this negative sentiment, the downgrade itself suggests a less optimistic outlook from a reputable analyst firm.  The probability of a price fall is therefore higher than a price rise, although the actual impact will depend heavily on the upcoming earnings report.

Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close today. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFourth-quarter earnings of the Mag 7 companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits of the Mag 7 are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\r\n\r\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nTesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Musk's proximity to Trump's administration during its second term. Trump's administration could help expedite regulatory approval for new versions of Tesla's self-driving software and for its autonomous \"robotaxis\" to hit the road.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit when the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump recently rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on TSLA shares. Tesla shares fell 5% in a month. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3. This software maker has witnessed a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025.

Over half of this spending will be focused on the United States, according to a blog post by Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president.\r\n\r\nThough Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the coming quarters. Microsoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days.

        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) is climbing 2% this morning after rallying nearly 8% yesterday. In a note to investors yesterday afternoon, investment bank Piper Sandler contended that a technical update by the social media firm may enable it to attract more advertisers.\n\nReddit's Update Could Be Significant\n\nThe company has made it easier for marketers to replicate on Reddit the ad campaigns that they're using on Meta (META), Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion explained. As a result, the number of firms advertising on Reddit could meaningfully increase, Champion asserted. Such a development, in turn, could cause the firm's revenue growth to accelerate, the analyst wrote.Evercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\n\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\n\nAnother Investment Bank Was Recently Bearish on RDDT\n\nIn a note to investors on Jan. 22, investment bank Roth Capital downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy. The investment bank predicted that the company's revenue growth would decelerate in upcoming quarters, and it expects RDDT's EBITA margins to drop over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Roth predicts that the company's user growth will slow this year after it added a record number of users in 2024. It placed a $195 price target on RDDT.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of RDDT\n\nIn the last month, the shares have advanced 20%, while they are up 70% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

The mention of Evercore ISI maintaining an 'Outperform' rating for AAPL and citing AI benefits is positive, but this is separate information and doesn't directly relate to the RDDT news.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty, converging towards a neutral prediction with a slight positive bias. Considering the lack of direct impact from the RDDT news, combined with the generally positive but vague outlook for AAPL, a slightly positive outlook is reasonable, but the overall impact is likely minimal.  The consensus from previous models leans slightly towards a rise, but the lack of strong catalysts for significant movement in either direction suggests probabilities closer to neutral.

The fact that Apple is considered the 'least-loved megacap' except for Tesla further reinforces the negative outlook.  The 18.2% drop in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter is a substantial figure and a key driver of the negative predictions.  While the market reaction to the news is already partially reflected in the 1.3% drop on Wednesday, the probability of a further fall is higher than a rise given the confluence of negative factors and the upcoming earnings report, which could potentially confirm or exacerbate these concerns.

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best American Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nWill the Market Continue To Be Bullish in 2025?\n\nWall Street\u2019s outlook for the stock market in 2025 reflects a cautious optimism following two consecutive years of substantial gains. Analysts predict continued growth, however at a more moderate pace compared to the explosive increases of 2023 and 2024. According to a report by CNN, published on January 1, strategists anticipate a 14.8% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, which is significant but lower than the previous years\u2019 performances. The Index saw gains of approximately 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. As per the report 2025 marks a return to typical growth rates after an extraordinary period of high returns, which has not been seen since the late 1990s.\n\nWhile several factors are expected to contribute to the market growth, there are potential risks that can hinder it. One of the key factors contributing to growth is the anticipated business-friendly policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Dan Ives, who is a technology senior analyst at Wedbush Securities in his December 30 note mentioned his expectations that tech stocks can rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration. The analyst has picked Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks as his best performers for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential risks that could negatively impact the stock market. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy decisions may create a volatile environment for markets. Traders are particularly wary of how proposed tariffs could affect economic stability and investor confidence. David Sekera from Morningstar emphasizes that the implementation of tariffs is a significant wildcard that could sway market performance in either direction. We recently covered the analysis of Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company in our article titled, 12 High Growth International Stocks to Invest in Now. Here\u2019s a piece from our coverage:\n\n\u201cWhile talking about large-cap stock performance, Timmer raises the question of whether this trend of narrow leadership will persist. He suggested that trends continue to move in the same direction until a significant change occurs. Given that large-cap growth stocks have dominated for years, it is reasonable to assume that they may continue to lead. However, he also cautioned the investors that as per the concept of mean reversion, asset prices will eventually return to their historical averages and when this happens, it could lead to sharp corrections in stock prices. Timmer believes that while 2024 was a \u201cGoldilocks year,\u201d for earnings and valuations, this year can be a tussle between higher earnings and rising long-term interest rates, thereby resulting in a volatile market.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo get the list of the 10 best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. Using the database we ranked the top 10 American stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an international provider of smartphones, personal computers, and other technology gadgets. Based in America, the company is renowned for its iPhone, Mac, and iPad. On January 27, Rosenblatt Securities reiterated their Buy rating on the stock, keeping the price target of $262. The firm expects the ongoing December quarter to be a bit low due to slower sales of the iPhone as it continues to face challenges from other Chinese manufacturers.\n\nManagement has been proactive in dealing with this competition. They released Apple Intelligence in June last year. The new artificial intelligence will be integrated with upcoming models to enhance user experience and act as a competitive edge over its competitors. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also shifted its focus on the Apple Store and its services revenue stream. As a result, the company was able to generate a record $25 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of 2024, indicating a 12% increase year-over-year.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here\u2019s what it is said regarding the company in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, negative factors include potential market volatility due to uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies, the risk of tariffs impacting economic stability, and the possibility of mean reversion in large-cap growth stocks.

        "content": "ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on January 29, 2025.

ASML's strong earnings and positive outlook, driven by AI chip demand, suggest continued demand for chips used in Apple products. While the DeepSeek news initially caused concern, ASML's CEO dismissed it, arguing that lower AI costs could increase overall chip demand. This positive sentiment from a key supplier like ASML, coupled with their strong financial performance, reduces the risk of supply chain disruptions or cost increases for Apple. However, the effect is indirect, and other factors influence Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a rise is moderate."

ASML's strong earnings beat and positive outlook, coupled with the CEO's reassurance regarding the impact of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model, suggest a positive outlook for the semiconductor industry.  While concerns about export restrictions to China remain, the overall positive sentiment towards increased AI chip demand outweighs these concerns in the short term.  Apple, as a major consumer of chips produced using ASML's equipment, is likely to benefit indirectly from this positive news. However, the impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be less direct and less pronounced than the impact on ASML. The correlation is not guaranteed to be strong, and other market factors could influence AAPL's price more significantly. Therefore, the probability of a price rise for AAPL is moderate, while the probability of a fall is relatively low."

Considering the consistency in positive sentiment across previous rounds and the indirect benefits to Apple from ASML's performance, I will maintain the probability of a rise, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and the indirect nature of the impact."

                    "reasoning": "The news is positive for Apple indirectly. ASML, a key supplier of chip-making equipment to TSMC (which supplies Apple), reported strong earnings and a positive outlook driven by AI chip demand. This suggests a healthy semiconductor industry, which benefits Apple. The CEO of ASML dismissed concerns about a new cost-effective AI model, suggesting continued strong demand.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price rise for AAPL, ranging from 0.55 to 0.72 for the probability of a rise. While the impact is indirect, the positive sentiment in the semiconductor sector is likely to have a positive spillover effect on Apple. However, the impact is indirect, and other market factors could influence Apple's stock price more significantly.  Considering the indirect nature of the news, the positive consensus from previous predictions, and the potential for other market influences, I'm assigning a probability of a price rise slightly higher than the average of previous predictions, while acknowledging the inherent uncertainty.  The convergence of predictions around 0.65-0.7 suggests a reasonable estimate."

        "content": "Jan 29- Shares of Tech Gaint Apple (AAPL, Financial) remained low on early trading on Wednesday, losing 1.5%share value after Oppenheimer downgraded shares from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", saying longer-term prospects are weaker than previously expected on iPhone sales projections that have come in weaker than polled estimates and increasing competition in China. The firm also tweaked its view on Apple's valuation and short-term growth prospects, cutting its previous $250 price target due to worries about the firm.\n\nThe EBITDA margin, however, climbed year on year, and Oppenheimer cut the fiscal year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 4% to $7.95, below the consensus estimate of $8.23. Firm drops Apple revenue forecast to $438 billion in FY26 from $456 billion. The revisions were blamed on iPhone demand slowdown, and analysts lowered their projected shipment growth for FY25 to 2% from 5% and kept an outlook of 2% for FY26.\n\nApple's falling market share in China is a major concern: iPhone shipments in Q4 dropped 25%, and the full year 2024 fell 17% for the iPhone, Canalys said. With local Android manufacturers pressuring Apple's dominance, market share dropped from 19% to 15%.\n\nApple will likely struggle to maintain premium valuation and revenue momentum in the years ahead as it battles with competitive headwinds and sluggish iPhone sales, analysts warn.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Oppenheimer's downgrade, coupled with lowered price target and revenue forecasts, signals a lack of confidence in Apple's near-term growth. The primary drivers are slowing iPhone sales, particularly in the crucial China market where Apple is losing market share to local competitors. The lowered EPS estimates and shipment growth projections further reinforce the bearish outlook. While EBITDA margin climbed, it's overshadowed by the significant concerns about revenue and market share. The initial 1.5% drop in share value on the news release day also indicates negative investor sentiment. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is significantly higher than the probability of it rising."

While the EBITDA margin increased, this positive factor is overshadowed by the substantial negative projections for revenue and EPS.

        "content": "Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks?

While the news suggests a potential shift in investor focus towards European equities, it also indicates that the AI enthusiasm may be evolving, which could lead to volatility in tech stocks. Given that Apple is part of the 'Magnificent 7' and is currently priced for perfection, there is a risk of downward pressure on its stock price. However, the overall market stabilization and the potential for broader earnings growth could support a moderate probability of price rise. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the uncertainties introduced by DeepSeek's emergence."

                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on the potential impact of DeepSeek on European stocks and the broader AI investment landscape. While Apple's App Store is mentioned as the platform where DeepSeek gained popularity, the core argument is about a potential shift in investment focus away from mega-cap tech companies (including those in the US) towards European equities. The news suggests that DeepSeek's emergence could challenge the dominance of existing AI models and potentially reduce the need for massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies. This could lead to a slight negative sentiment towards companies like Apple, as it implies a possible shift in investor focus and potentially lower growth expectations for the 'Magnificent 7'. However, the impact on Apple is indirect. The primary beneficiary, according to the analysis, would be European stocks. The negative impact on Apple is tempered by the fact that it is still a major player in the tech space and its App Store remains a key platform. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not dramatically so."

While DeepSeek's success challenges the narrative of massive AI investment being necessary, the article doesn't directly impact Apple's fundamentals or prospects. The main point is that the shift in investor sentiment towards European stocks, as suggested by Citi, is a macro trend and not directly related to Apple's performance.  Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal and indirect.  Any price movement would be more likely due to broader market fluctuations than this specific news."

This development has raised questions about the necessity of massive AI spending by mega-cap tech companies, including Apple. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped, with Nvidia being a significant decliner, indicating potential investor concerns about AI competition. Citi analysts suggest that AI enthusiasm may be evolving, potentially leading to less concentrated earnings in the 'Magnificent 7' tech companies, including Apple. This could imply a shift in investor focus away from US mega-cap tech stocks like Apple towards European equities, which are seen as more reasonably priced. Given this context, Apple's stock may face downward pressure due to reduced investor focus and potential concerns over AI competition."

The previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with most models leaning towards a higher probability of a fall due to concerns about AI competition and a shift in investor focus. However, some models see a minimal direct impact on Apple. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the overall context, I believe the negative sentiment is slightly overblown. While there might be some short-term volatility, Apple's strong fundamentals and diverse revenue streams should mitigate any significant negative impact. However, the overall sentiment is still slightly negative, and the trend of previous predictions is leaning towards a fall. Therefore, I will give a slightly higher probability of stock price falling, but not as high as some of the previous predictions, considering Apple's resilience."

Considering the indirect nature of the news, the overall market context (stabilization and potential broader earnings growth), and the consistent trend in previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price fall is most likely, but not a dramatic one.

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA). For these stocks, we have also provided the hedge fund sentiment, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Picks for 2025?\n\nCanadapanda / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The overall tone is mixed; while Apple is recognized as a strong company, the article suggests other investments might offer greater potential.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderate, but not overwhelmingly high due to the counterbalancing factors and the lack of a strong endorsement from O'Leary."

        "headline": "Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThe companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The fact that T-Mobile is already beta-testing this with iPhones suggests a level of integration and commitment. However, the news also mentions that Globalstar shares fell, indicating a potential negative impact on Apple's existing partnership. The lack of official comment from Apple introduces some uncertainty. Overall, the potential benefits of the Starlink partnership seem to outweigh the risks, leading to a higher probability of a stock price increase. The fact that the news was 'secretly' worked on and is now being rolled out also suggests a positive surprise for investors.

        "headline": "Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition",
        "content": "By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth on Thursday as its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season.\n\nThe company and its rivals Google and Samsung have been leaning on AI to drive sales of their devices. But Apple's latest iPhone 16 series lacked such features at launch in September and some of its AI services, including an improved Siri, are only expected later this year in some regions.\n\nApple's challenges with AI were highlighted this month when it had to pull a news-summarizing AI tool due to inaccurate headlines, which drew criticism from the BBC and other news outlets.\n\n\"AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple's handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\" said Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns Apple shares.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei as well as other Chinese smartphone makers, Apple saw its share of the global smartphone market narrow to 23% in the final three months of 2024 from almost 25% a year earlier, according to IDC data.\n\nThe decline was steeper in China - its third-largest market - where Apple's share fell by 10 percentage points to 17%, the data showed.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has been offering subsidies to smartphone purchasers to boost domestic consumption, these subsidies target low- to mid-tier phones priced below $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nWorries about iPhone demand have weighed on Apple shares this year, dragging them 5% lower so far in January.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to post revenue growth of 3.8% for the three months to December, Apple's first fiscal quarter, according to data from LSEG. That is well below the 6.1% growth the company posted in the September quarter, which included only a few days of new iPhone sales.\n\nSales of iPhone will likely tick up 1.9% in the first quarter, weaker than the 5.5% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nMac sales are expected to rise 2.3%, slightly faster compared with the previous three months, while iPad revenue is expected to increase by 4.2%, a slower pace than the fourth quarter.\n\nThe services business, which has in recent years outpaced growth in Apple's devices, is expected to post an increase of 12.9% in sales.\n\nLike other companies with a large global presence, Apple is also set to be hit by a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened by nearly 8% in the final three months of 2024 amid expectations for trade tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"With more than 50% of sales coming from outside of the Americas, the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen in the December quarter could make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates,\" warned Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

While the services business is expected to grow, the overall tone suggests downward pressure on the stock. The fact that the stock has already fallen 5% in January indicates existing investor concerns. The tepid revenue growth forecast further reinforces this negative sentiment.

While the slower-than-expected revenue growth (3.8% vs. expected 6.1%) and lagging AI features compared to competitors are significant negatives, potentially impacting iPhone sales and market share, particularly in China, there are some mitigating factors.  The services sector continues to show strong growth (12.9%), suggesting resilience in other areas of the business.  The impact of the stronger dollar is a concern, but it's a macroeconomic factor affecting many companies, not unique to Apple.  The market has already priced in some negative sentiment, as evidenced by the 5% drop in January.  Therefore, while the negative news is substantial, the probability of a significant further drop is lessened by the already-reflected market sentiment and the continued strength in the services sector.  A price rise is less likely given the current headwinds, but a complete collapse is also unlikely."

While the services sector shows continued growth, this is unlikely to offset the substantial headwinds in the hardware sector, especially given the iPhone's importance to Apple's overall revenue.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple previous predictions reinforces this negative outlook. The 5% January drop already reflects some negative market sentiment, and the tepid revenue growth forecast further supports a higher probability of a stock price decline.  However, Apple's strong brand and the potential for future AI integration could limit the downside.  The overall consensus from previous predictions leans heavily towards a price fall, and I see no compelling reason to deviate significantly from that consensus.  Therefore, I predict a higher probability of a stock price fall, although the magnitude of the fall is uncertain."

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 29, 2025\u2013 Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL.\n\nApple Earnings: Should Investors Take a Bite?\n\nThis week's reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the company is expected to report earnings growth, its stock has underperformed recently. Key areas to watch include China sales (which have been weak but are projected to improve), Services revenue (which is expected to be strong), and iPhone sales (particularly regarding the impact of Apple Intelligence). The article also mentions that Apple's top and bottom line growth has been cooling. The current Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment among analysts. Given the recent underperformance, the mixed outlook, and the 'Sell' rating, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The market's reaction will heavily depend on the actual earnings report and management's guidance, especially regarding Apple Intelligence adoption and China performance. A positive surprise in these areas could lead to a stock price increase, but the current indicators suggest a higher likelihood of a negative reaction."

                    "reasoning": "The Zacks Investment Ideas article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's upcoming earnings report. While the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate shows a modest 8% year-over-year growth, and Services revenue is projected to increase significantly, several factors point to potential downside.  Apple's stock is already down 8% for the year, underperforming the S&P 500.  Concerns remain about slowing growth, particularly in the crucial China market (though a positive year-over-year change is forecast). The success of Apple Intelligence is uncertain and will heavily influence investor sentiment.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reflects analyst bearishness.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the potential for a positive surprise from strong Services revenue or better-than-expected China sales exists."

China sales have been a persistent weak spot, though the upcoming report may show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters. The Services segment remains strong, but the iPhone's performance and the adoption of Apple Intelligence are uncertain. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) reflects analyst bearishness. Given the mixed outlook and the critical nature of the upcoming earnings report, the stock's movement will likely hinge on whether the positives (Services growth, potential China recovery) outweigh the negatives (stagnant growth, iPhone uncertainty)."

The article highlights that Apple's shares have had a rough start in 2025, down about 8%, and are underperforming the S&P 500. However, the earnings and sales revisions have been primarily unchanged, with an expected 8% growth in EPS year-over-year and 3.7% growth in top line year-over-year. The article also emphasizes key metrics to watch, such as China's results, Services segment, and iPhone sales. Given the current bearish sentiment (Zacks Rank #4) and the importance of guidance and adoption of Apple Intelligence, there is a mixed outlook. However, the unchanged earnings revisions and stable top-line growth suggest a slightly positive bias."

The company's shares have underperformed the S&P 500 so far in 2025, down around 8%. Analysts have been quiet regarding EPS revisions, suggesting 8% growth year-over-year. However, the company's top-line growth has been cooling, and its China revenue has fallen short of estimates in five consecutive releases. The article mentions that the Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales is expected to show the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters, which could be a positive sign. Additionally, Apple's Services segment has been robust, with a consensus estimate of $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure. The iPhone results will also be under scrutiny, as it accounts for nearly 50% of Apple's sales. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be around 0.45, while the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be around 0.55, due to the overall bearish sentiment among analysts and the company's recent underperformance."

        "headline": "Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
        "content": "It's a good time to be a bull on Wall Street. Since the start of 2023, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-inspired Nasdaq Composite have respectively soared by 34%, 59%, and 91%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 24, 2025.\n\nInvestors haven't hurt for catalysts, with a softening in the prevailing rate of inflation, better-than-expected corporate earnings, and Donald Trump's return to the White House helping to lift equities. But topping the list of factors that have sparked this bull market rally is the ascension of artificial intelligence (AI).Image source: Apple.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's most-influential businesses have leaned on AI as a way to fuel their growth, one of Wall Street's biggest businesses, tech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has put $725 billion to work elsewhere to boost its bottom line.\n\nApple is one of Wall Street's largest businesses for a reason (and AI is part of it)\n\nApple was the very first public company to top $3 trillion in market value, and as of this past weekend was the second-largest company, behind only Nvidia. Apple has consistently led Wall Street higher for years -- and its success is no accident.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone is the premier smartphone domestically. Since rolling out the first 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple's share of domestic smartphone sales has been 50% or higher. The ongoing upgrade of wireless networks to support 5G download speeds has led to relatively consistent demand for the company's iPhone.\n\nApple's innovation has also played a key role in sending its market cap to north of $3 trillion. This innovation includes physical products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as its ongoing transformation into a platforms company.\n\nFor years, CEO Tim Cook has overseen the push to promote subscription services. By focusing on subscriptions, Apple has an opportunity to lift its operating margin, improve its already impressive customer loyalty, and smooth out the revenue peaks and valleys that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles. Apple's Services segment has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage and now accounts for around a quarter of the company's net sales.\n\nLike most tech stocks, Apple is betting big on AI to power its top-and-bottom-line growth. Last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, which is its AI-driven personal intelligence model for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Intelligence can do everything from write and summarize text to create images for users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLastly, Apple's balance sheet is cash rich, which allows it to aggressively invest in its future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis $725 billion investment has been crucial to Apple's profit growth\n\nWhile this confluence of factors has helped Apple become the company it is today, arguably the greatest driver of Apple's growth in earnings per share (EPS) hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm talking about Apple's single greatest investment: stock repurchases.\n\nIn 2013, Apple's board kicked off a share buyback program that quickly became the envy of the investing word. Here's a breakdown of Apple's repurchasing activity in each of its last 11 fiscal years (its fiscal year typically ends in late September):\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion 2024: $94.949 billion\n\nCollectively, Apple has bought back $725.69 billion of its shares spanning 11 years and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% in the process. To put this into some context, the $6.08 in EPS Apple reported in fiscal 2024 would have equated to just $3.47 in EPS if the board hadn't authorized any share buybacks.AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts.\n\nAn ongoing share repurchase program serves a number of purposes for Apple. For one, as noted, it reduces the company's outstanding share count, which can increase EPS and make the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nSecondly, buyback programs tend to incentivize long-term investing. When a company's outstanding share count declines by a considerable amount over time, it incrementally increases the ownership stakes of investors. When investors buy and hold, it typically reduces share price volatility, which can also make a stock more attractive to investors.\n\nAnd third, buybacks intimate that Apple's insiders (the board and management team) believe shares of their company remain attractively valued.\n\nNot even Apple's world-leading buyback program can mask these issues\n\nWith more cash than Apple knows what to do with on its balance sheet (and generated from its operations), there's no end in sight to this world-leading buyback program.\n\nBut just because Apple is buying back its shares at a breakneck pace, it doesn't necessarily mean its stock is a good value. Billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in its top holding, Apple, over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30) -- and there are two good reasons why this selling is likely taking place.AAPL Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nFirst off, Apple's physical product sales have stalled out for two years. Even though iPhone remains the top-selling smartphone in the U.S., stagnant sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other wearables suggest consumers aren't being wowed by the company's physical products in the same way they have in the past. Though it's possible the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac will turn these fortunes around, not even historically high inflation helped Apple grow sales of its physical product lines in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe other prominent concern with Apple is that its stock is historically pricey. Despite its aggressive share buybacks, Apple recently hit a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 42, which is a level that hasn't been witnessed in 17 years. The stock market is itself pushing the envelope on the valuation front, and Apple's premium is even more pronounced.\n\nThough Apple's share repurchases are bound to continue, there's a lot of work to be done with the company's physical products before its current valuation makes sense.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

On the positive side, it highlights Apple's massive stock buyback program, which has significantly boosted EPS and incentivized long-term investing. The article also mentions the continued strength of the iPhone and the growth of Apple's services segment. However, there are also negative points. The article points out that physical product sales have stalled, and Apple's P/E ratio is historically high. Furthermore, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has reduced its stake in Apple, signaling potential concerns about valuation or future growth. The article also mentions Apple Intelligence, which is a positive catalyst. Considering these factors, the positive aspects related to the buyback program and services growth are somewhat offset by concerns about product sales, valuation, and Buffett's reduced stake. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so. The 'Double Down' advertisement is disregarded as it is promotional material and not directly related to the core analysis of Apple's financial health based on the news article."

Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Apple stake further adds to the negative sentiment. The high valuation and slowing sales growth outweigh the positive impact of the buyback program and AI initiatives in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise, although the overall market conditions mentioned (strong bull market) could partially mitigate the negative impact of the news."

The massive $725 billion stock buyback program is a significant positive, demonstrably boosting EPS and signaling confidence from insiders.  However, this is counterbalanced by serious concerns: stagnant physical product sales for two consecutive years, a historically high P/E ratio exceeding 42, and Warren Buffett's substantial reduction of his stake.  While the buybacks artificially inflate EPS, the underlying sales stagnation suggests a potential lack of future growth. The high P/E ratio indicates the market is already pricing in significant future growth, making the stock vulnerable to negative surprises. Buffett's actions are a strong bearish signal, suggesting he sees better investment opportunities elsewhere.  The overall market's bullish trend might offer some support, but the fundamental issues with Apple's product sales and valuation are significant enough to outweigh the positive impact of the buybacks in the short to medium term. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the weight of the negative factors."

While the buyback program and services growth provide support, the high valuation and lack of growth in product sales could lead to downward pressure on the stock. Considering these factors and the trend in previous predictions, which show a range of opinions but a slight leaning towards a bearish outlook due to valuation concerns and stagnant product sales, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall."

        "headline": "Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments",

ASML's strong results also suggest continued demand in the semiconductor industry, which is indirectly positive for Apple. However, the emergence of a low-cost AI model from DeepSeek raises concerns about the value of Apple's AI investments, potentially leading to investor skepticism. The Fed's expected decision to hold interest rates steady is unlikely to have a significant direct impact on Apple's stock price. The upcoming earnings report is a major catalyst, and the market's reaction will depend on Apple's performance and outlook, particularly regarding AI. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise due to the overall market rebound and potential for positive earnings surprises, but the AI concerns and LVMH's disappointing sales growth temper the optimism."

The fact that this growth is not related to AI suggests a positive diversification of revenue streams or a successful strategic move in other areas. Such a large investment contributing to growth typically leads to increased investor confidence and can drive up the stock price. Given the positive impact on EPS and the overall favorable tone of the news, it is reasonable to predict a higher probability of the stock price rising. The previous predictions also show a consensus that the stock price is more likely to rise than fall, with probabilities ranging from 0.65 to 0.85. Therefore, based on the news and the trend of previous predictions, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of falling."

Allspring Global Investments Senior Portfolio Manager and Head of Capital Allocation Margie Patel joins Market Domination to discuss the tech sector outlook as the earnings season progresses.\n\nPatel acknowledges that she expected 2025 to \"be a year of deceleration in growth\" for tech, adding that there is still \"uncertainty\" regarding DeepSeek's impact. However, she notes that historically, new product entries into the tech market tend to create increased demand, \"so everybody really benefits.\"\n\nAddressing valuation concerns in the tech sector, she points out that Big Tech PE ratios (price-earnings) have experienced \"erosion\" in recent months as investors worry about slowing growth and negative capital expenditure impacts.\n\nNevertheless, Patel remains optimistic, projecting 20% earnings growth for the sector in 2025, which would \"justify\" current valuations.

While a 20% earnings growth projection for Big Tech in 2025 is positive, it's a future prediction and doesn't guarantee immediate stock price movement for Apple.  The mention of 'erosion' in PE ratios and uncertainty surrounding DeepSeek's impact introduces downside risk.  The article lacks specific information about Apple's performance or prospects. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted compared to a news item directly concerning Apple. We should expect the market to react to the overall tech sector sentiment, which is cautiously optimistic.

This is a positive signal for Apple, but there are concerns about slowing growth, valuation erosion, and the impact of DeepSeek's AI model. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, but with varying degrees of confidence. The trend of previous predictions shows a slight fluctuation in the probability of stock price rising. Considering the positive earnings growth projection and the slightly positive bias in previous predictions, I will lean towards a higher probability of a rise, but temper it slightly due to the existing uncertainties and the mixed opinions in the previous rounds. The news focuses on the broader tech sector, not Apple specifically, which suggests a muted impact on AAPL. Taking all these factors into account, I predict a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall."

This is a future projection, however, and doesn't guarantee immediate impact on Apple's stock price.  The news also highlights uncertainties: slowing growth, valuation erosion, and the disruptive potential of DeepSeek's AI model.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning slightly positive but with significant uncertainty. The lack of Apple-specific information and the general nature of the news (focused on the broader tech sector) suggest a muted impact on AAPL.  The consensus from previous models shows a gradual increase in the probability of a price rise over rounds, indicating a strengthening of positive sentiment. Considering the positive outlook tempered by uncertainties and the general nature of the news, a conservative estimate is warranted, slightly higher than a coin flip but acknowledging significant uncertainty.  The trend shows a slight increase in the probability of a price rise, but it remains below 0.7, suggesting that the market remains cautious.

Earlier this month, another research firm stated that AAPL had dropped to third place in terms of smartphone market share in the Asian country.Dan Niles on Apple (AAPL): Data is \u2018Somewhat Disappointing\u2019 and Stock is \u2018Pretty Expensive\n\nAn Apple store displaying the latest in consumer electronics, from smartphones to wearables.\n\nThe iPhone Was Reportedly the Q4 Market Share Leader in China\n\nThe device's market share in China came in at 17.4% last quarter, the International Data Corporation (IDC) reported. That was slightly above second-place Huawei's 17.2% share. However, the device's market share was significantly lower last quarter than in Q4 of 2023, when it controlled 20% of the market. Further, for all of 2024, its market share dropped to 15.6% from 17.4% in 2023.\n\nLast week, another research firm, Counterpoint, reported that the iPhone's market share had been 17.1% in China last quarter, leaving the device in third place in the huge market. Counterpoint added that the number of devices handed over by Apple in China had tumbled 18.2% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier. In Q4 of 2023, iPhone's market share was 20.2%.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of AAPL Stock\n\nIn the last month, the shares have fallen 4.5%, while they are up 2.5% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, there are concerns about the overall market share decline and a significant drop in device sales year-over-year. The mixed signals from different research firms regarding market share and the commentary on Apple's valuation being 'pretty expensive' suggest caution. Therefore, while there is a probability of a stock price rise due to the positive sales report, the concerns about market share and valuation may lead to a notable probability of a stock price fall as well."

                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the headline highlights a 4% climb due to IDC reporting the iPhone as the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter, the underlying data reveals a more nuanced situation. IDC's report shows a slight lead over Huawei but a significant year-over-year market share decline. Counterpoint's report paints an even less favorable picture, placing Apple in third place with a substantial drop in device shipments. The article also mentions that the stock has fallen 4.5% in the last month. Furthermore, the article suggests that other AI stocks may offer better returns. The initial positive reaction (4% climb) suggests some positive sentiment, but the conflicting data and negative trends indicate potential for a correction. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a rise, as the underlying data doesn't fully support the initial positive reaction."

                    "reasoning": "The news presents conflicting information regarding Apple's performance in the Chinese market. While one research firm (IDC) reports Apple as the top-selling smartphone brand in Q4 with a 17.4% market share, another (Counterpoint) places Apple in third place with a 17.1% share and an 18.2% year-over-year decline in shipments.  The discrepancy between these reports creates uncertainty.  Furthermore, the article highlights a significant drop in market share compared to the previous year (from 20% to 15.6% for the full year 2024).  The 4% price increase mentioned is likely a short-term reaction to the positive IDC report, but the conflicting data and overall market share decline suggest a more cautious outlook.  The author's opinion that AI stocks offer better prospects and that AAPL is 'pretty expensive' adds to the bearish sentiment. Considering these factors, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a fall, although the short-term market reaction might temporarily skew the probabilities."

On one hand, Apple's iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter with a 17.4% market share, slightly above Huawei's 17.2%. This positive news has contributed to a 4% rise in AAPL's stock price today. However, the market share has declined compared to Q4 2023 (20% to 17.4%), and for the entire year 2024, it dropped from 17.4% to 15.6%. Another research firm, Counterpoint, reported a steeper decline in Q4 2024 with an 18.2% drop in iPhone shipments and a 17.1% market share, placing Apple in third place. The mixed data, combined with the stock's recent performance (down 4.5% in the last month but up 2.5% in the last three months), suggests that while there is some positive momentum, there are also concerns about declining market share and competitive pressures in China. The analyst's comment that the data is 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock is 'pretty expensive' adds to the uncertainty. Given the immediate positive reaction to the news, the probability of a stock price rise is higher in the short term, but the underlying concerns could limit the upside."

On one hand, a research firm, International Data Corporation (IDC), reported that iPhones were the best-selling smartphone in China last quarter with a 17.4% market share, slightly above Huawei's 17.2%. This information caused the stock to advance 4% today. On the other hand, another research firm, Counterpoint, reported that iPhone's market share left it in third place in China, and the number of devices handed over by Apple in China had tumbled 18.2% in Q4 versus the same period a year earlier. Additionally, analyst Dan Niles described the data as 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock as 'pretty expensive'. Given these mixed signals, there is a potential for both positive and negative reactions in the stock price. However, the immediate 4% advance suggests a positive short-term reaction to the IDC report. Considering the short-term positive reaction and the historical resilience of AAPL, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but the overall sentiment remains cautiously optimistic."

The analyst's comment about the data being 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock being 'pretty expensive' further dampens the outlook.

This discrepancy is crucial. The initial 4% price increase is a short-term reaction to the positive IDC report, but this is likely unsustainable given the substantial negative data from Counterpoint.  Analyst comments about the data being 'somewhat disappointing' and the stock being 'pretty expensive' add significant weight to the bearish sentiment.  The previous predictions from various models show a clear convergence towards a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, reflecting the uncertainty and the more substantial negative trends. Considering the short-term positive reaction and the long-term concerns, a balanced probability is inappropriate given the conflicting data.

        "headline": "OpenAI launches ChatGPT Gov as industry reels from DeepSeek's breakout",
        "content": "OpenAI on Tuesday announced a new tailored version of ChatGPT designed for US government agencies, a product launch that comes as the industry is still reeling from the breakout of a cost-efficient Chinese AI startup and as President Trump has urged tech companies to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nOpenAI says the new service, ChatGPT Gov, is meant to streamline the government's access to its models. And it will give staffers the ability to better manage their own security and compliance as agencies handle sensitive data.\n\n\"By making our products available to the U.S. government, we aim to ensure AI serves the national interest and the public good, aligned with democratic values, while empowering policymakers to responsibly integrate these capabilities to deliver better services to the American people,\" the company said in a statement unveiling the new tool.\n\nOpenAI says the special version of ChatGPT gives government agencies many of the same capabilities as its ChatGPT enterprise tool, including custom chatbots that employees can build and share and access to GPT-4o, OpenAI's flagship model.Last week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office, dubbed the Stargate Project. Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son, Oracle chief technology officer Larry Ellison and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, attended the unveiling. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nThe move further cements OpenAI's partnership with the US government, positioning its technology as a key asset for maintaining American tech leadership.\n\nLast week, OpenAI was among a handful of tech companies backing a new $500 billion AI project, announced in a splashy unveiling by President Trump on his second day in office. Dubbed the Stargate Project, the new AI company will be co-led by OpenAI and SoftBank, with key initial technology partners Arm (ARM), Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), and Oracle (ORCL).\n\nThe launch of ChatGPT Gov arrives just a day after the Chinese upstart DeepSeek roiled Wall Street and the tech world. On Monday, the surging popularity of DeepSeek's new R1 model, which vaulted to the top of app download charts, prompted a market rout for many of AI's biggest players. Nvidia, the chipmaker at the heart of the AI boom, plummeted 17%, alongside losses from other chip and tech names.\n\nThe team behind DeepSeek claims to have built the innovative model for a fraction of the cost of other popular AI assistants without the computing power of the most advanced chips available to US firms.\n\nThe broader implication of DeepSeek's success is that it undermines the model of massive investment that American tech giants are pursuing in the AI arms race. But some analysts have questioned whether DeepSeek has disclosed the true cost of R1's development and if DeepSeek actually has more advanced chips than initially thought.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite the initial panic on Wall Street, some market observers say heightened competition will actually increase industry spending and lead to further innovation. Meta (META) and Apple (AAPL), for instance, gained ground during the sell-off, on the belief that their platforms would benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. President Trump called DeepSeek's arrival a \"wake-up call\" for the industry.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

On one hand, the rise of DeepSeek and its cost-effective AI model could benefit Apple, as the article suggests that Apple's platform could benefit from more cost-effective models and cheaper ways of running them. This is reflected in the fact that Apple gained ground during the sell-off prompted by DeepSeek's rise. On the other hand, the news focuses primarily on OpenAI's initiatives (ChatGPT Gov and the Stargate Project) and the competitive landscape in AI, with DeepSeek's emergence posing a challenge to the established players. While Apple is mentioned as potentially benefiting from cheaper AI models, it's not directly involved in the OpenAI initiatives or the Stargate Project as a core partner like Microsoft, Nvidia, or Oracle. Therefore, the positive impact is indirect and less pronounced. Given the overall context, the news is slightly positive for Apple, but not overwhelmingly so.

        "headline": "Why DeepSeek has been so unsettling for the stock market in 3 charts",
        "content": "A cheaper, competitive AI model from Chinese artificial intelligence company DeepSeek sparked a sell-off in the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) on Monday as it challenged one of the key drivers of the current bull market.\n\nFor the first time in a while, investors had a tangible reason to believe some US tech giants, namely Nvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO), might not grow earnings by as much as initially hoped in the coming year. The team behind DeepSeek, the artificial intelligence model maker, claimed that the technology uses cheaper chips and less data. Investors are concerned this could hurt future AI chip sales for a company like Nvidia as well as bring into question the dominance of US hyperscalers in AI.\n\nThe problem for markets is that Big Tech's earnings beats have been driving stocks higher over the past two years.\n\n\"The key pillar of this bull market is earning estimates moving higher,\" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added, \"Tech is at the forefront of the overall return for the market this year.\"\n\nAs Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna pointed out in Yahoo Finance's latest Chartbook, Big Tech earnings from the giants \u2014 Nvidia, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Apple (AAPL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) \u2014 have seen earnings estimates rise more than the rest of the S&P 500 and the MSCI Europe (IEUR) index over the past 12 months.\n\nYesterday's more than 3% decline in the Nasdaq and 1.5% drop in the S&P 500 show how the market could react if both the blue (Big Tech earnings estimates) and green lines (the rest of S&P 500 estimates) in Krishna's chart below begin reversing direction.\n\nThe expected scrutiny over tech earnings will come amid a market that Richard Bernstein, CEO of Richard Bernstein Advisors, told Yahoo Finance is ripe for change. Bernstein'scontribution to Yahoo Finance's Chartbook showed how just 29% of stocks in the S&P 500 outperformed the index in 2024 and 30% outperformed in 2023. This marked the lowest number of outperformers since the late 1990s.\n\n\"It\u2019s probably incorrect that there is a new paradigm in which the 'Magnificent Seven' secularly dominate the market,\" Bernstein said. \"Such extreme, narrow leadership is rare because it goes against capitalism, open markets, and competition.\"\n\n\"We think 2025 [will] be a year of returning to normal broader markets as speculation meets reduced liquidity and fundamental investing again outperforms.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nBernstein's call for broader returns in 2025 matches the takeaway from a chart shared with Yahoo Finance by Nicole Inui, HSBC's head of equity research for the Americas. Inui's chart shows that while Magnificent Seven earnings are still expected to grow more than the other 493 stocks in the index in 2025, the gap is expected to narrow, making the case for a broadening of the stock market rally.\n\n\"Mag 7, while still outpacing the overall index on earnings growth, is expected to be less of an outlier.\"\n\nTo both Bernstein and Inui's credit, that market action played out on Monday. Roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself. Nvidia's large losses led to most of the downside action in the overall index.\n\nThis introduces a stark reality for investors. Should Big Tech's dominance wane, it might become a better environment for stock pickers to find names that could outperform the S&P 500. But it also likely means that the massive gains seen for the broader indexes over the past two years won't come as swiftly if the largest companies in the index aren't leading the charge.Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on Jan. 15, 2025, in New York City.

The article suggests a potential shift in market dynamics where broader market participation becomes more important, which could be neutral to slightly positive for Apple if it can maintain its earnings while other sectors catch up. However, the overall tone is cautious, suggesting a potential slowdown in the rapid growth of the past two years. Given the uncertainty and the potential for reduced growth expectations, a slight downward pressure on Apple's stock price is more likely in the short term. The article also mentions that roughly 70% of stocks in the S&P 500 closed in the green, despite a more than 1.5% drop in the index itself, which suggests that the market is not entirely bearish."

The overall market reaction was a decline in the Nasdaq and S&P 500, driven largely by Nvidia's losses.  However, the article also highlights a shift towards broader market participation, suggesting a potential decrease in the dominance of Big Tech, including Apple. This could lead to less dramatic overall market gains, but doesn't necessarily predict a fall in Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price rise is lower than usual due to the overall negative market sentiment surrounding AI competition and the potential for reduced Big Tech dominance, but Apple's relatively less direct exposure to the DeepSeek threat compared to Nvidia suggests a lower probability of a significant fall."

The market reaction suggests a shift away from over-reliance on tech giants, which could lead to short-term downward pressure on Apple's stock. However, Apple's diversified business model might offer some resilience compared to pure AI-dependent firms like Nvidia. Given the current market sentiment, the probability of a fall in Apple's stock price is higher than a rise in the near term."

It mentions that investors are concerned about the potential decrease in AI chip sales for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom, which could negatively affect the earnings growth of Big Tech companies, including Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article highlights that Big Tech earnings have been driving stocks higher over the past two years, and any change in this trend could lead to a broader market reaction. However, it also notes that despite the current decline, there are expectations for a broadening of the stock market rally in 2025. Given this context, the stock price of Apple Inc.

        "content": "Chip stocks tick back up in Tuesday's pre-market trading, a first step in recovering from Monday's DeepSeek AI-driven tech sell-off. The ripple effect the Chinese startup's newest artificial intelligence model had on the wider landscape has left investors concerned about Big Tech's spending on AI and potential overconcentration in the sector as a whole.\n\nT. Rowe Price's Global Technology Fund portfolio manager Dom Rizzo joins Morning Brief to suggest that while short-term consolidation may occur, the medium-term outlook remains strong after the DeepSeek shakeup.\n\n\"Well, if you think about what's happened, DeepSeek really gave this incredible innovation to the world in terms of model efficiency by open-sourcing their V3 and their R1 models\u2026 And quite naturally, the first market reaction is, 'oh my gosh, GPU utilization is getting better, memory utilization is getting more efficient.' That must mean that AI spending goes down.\"\n\nWhile the DeepSeek reaction \"actually implies that compute intensity and GPU intensity could go up [in the medium term],\" Rizzo states. \"So I think it still remains to be seen.\" Related Videos\n\n05:24\n\nAre markets overreacting to DeepSeek AI or is Big Tech 'stretched'?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 17 hours ago 02:11\n\nTrump Admin Continues Military Deportation Flights Despite Resistance\n\nWSJ \u2022 17 hours ago 02:53\n\nTrump's tariff threats work with Colombia, but China may be trickier\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 21 hours ago 02:01\n\nHow Trump\u2019s immigration policies could impact the economy\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago\n\nHe also highlights that the future and rate of AI spending is really \"a business model question\" for the biggest hyperscalers. He sees companies like Nvidia (NVDA) benefiting from the increasing compute needs tied to AI, while others tech players may scale back their investments.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief here.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments",

                    "reasoning": "The financial news discusses a tech sell-off related to AI spending concerns, particularly after DeepSeek's impact. Expert analysis suggests that this sell-off might be a short-term reaction, and the medium-term outlook for Big Tech's AI investment remains positive. Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major player in the tech sector with significant AI investments, and the overall sentiment leans towards recovery and growth. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a general consensus that Apple is likely to benefit from long-term trends in AI spending, though there is some caution about short-term volatility."

        "content": "This week\u2019s reporting docket is headlined by many notable companies, a list that includes beloved Mag 7 member Apple AAPL. Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan\u2019s results push some life back into shares? Let\u2019s take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nAs shown below, the company\u2019s top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple\u2019s overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt\u2019s critical to keep a close eye on Apple\u2019s China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company\u2019s China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple\u2019s Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAs shown below, the company has regularly exceeded expectations on the metric, with the one exception coming in its latest print.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd last but not least, the company\u2019s iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we\u2019ll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple AAPL is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock\u2019s movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone\u2019s new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it\u2019s worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

China revenue has been a concern, but forecasts suggest a potential positive change. Services revenue is a strong point, consistently exceeding expectations. iPhone sales, driven by Apple Intelligence, are crucial but uncertain. The stock currently holds a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment. Overall, the negative factors (bearish analyst sentiment, past China performance, stagnant top-line growth) slightly outweigh the potential positives (Services growth, potential China recovery, Apple Intelligence impact). Therefore, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more probable."

The stock's current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) reflects analyst bearishness.  The positive year-over-year growth forecast for China sales is a potential upside, but the overall picture is cautious.

However, the potential for positive surprises in Services and China sales is acknowledged, which slightly mitigates the downward pressure."

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 28, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Apple AAPL, Dell Technologies DELL, HP HPQ and Microsoft MSFT.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday\u2019s Analyst Blog:\n\nBuy, Sell or Hold Apple Stock? Key Tips Ahead of Q1 Earnings\n\nAppleis set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\n\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nApple expects the December quarter's (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple's fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year.\n\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAAPL's earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\n\nLet's see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple's iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple's fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion.\n\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple's installed base has been a concern.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL's Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\n\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple's Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple's Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple's estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC's vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo's growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies and HP saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\n\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies' 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple's market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\n\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner's list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 27.5%.\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\n\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 27.54X.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL's Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\n\nApple's AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul.\n\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the \"Magnificent 7\" group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\n\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple's stringent privacy standards.\n\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\n\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple's near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\n\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

While overall revenue and EPS are expected to grow, driven by Services and Mac sales, iPhone sales are projected to decline due to competition in China and a delayed AI launch. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests negative sentiment. The underperformance of AAPL compared to the sector and a stretched valuation are also concerning. However, the positive long-term impact of Apple Intelligence and the growth in the Services segment offer some upside potential. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term, especially given the negative Zacks Rank and iPhone sales concerns."

While the company is expected to report low to mid-single-digit revenue growth, exceeding the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in the past four quarters, there are significant headwinds.  iPhone sales are projected to decline slightly due to competition in China and a delayed launch of Apple Intelligence.  However, the Services segment is expected to show strong double-digit growth, and Mac sales are anticipated to rise.  The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) is a strong negative indicator.  The article highlights both positive factors (Services growth, Mac sales increase, AI push) and negative factors (China headwinds, iPhone sales decline, delayed Apple Intelligence, stretched valuation).  Considering the mixed signals and the negative Zacks Rank, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term given the already priced-in expectations."

        "content": "Investing.com - Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's artificial intelligence model than its other Big Tech rivals who have invested heavily in building out their AI capabilities, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts argued that the iPhone maker, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on [large language models] or infrastructure\".\n\nAlthough the company is continuing to roll out its Apple Intelligence AI-enhanced service in its latest iPhone offerings, the competitive impact of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model is \"limited\", the analysts said. Indeed, longer term, expanding generative AI capabilities could catalyze a \"better cycle\" of product upgrades, they noted.\n\nDeepSeek, a small Chinese start-up, roiled global stock markets on Monday after it introduced a free chatbot it says can compete with the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant, which is run on the model, became the top-rated app on Apple's App Store in the US on Monday, overtaking OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said the company represented a \"wake-up call\" for America's tech giants.\n\nIn its fiscal fourth quarter, Apple said payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by peers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\nApple is due to report its December quarter results after the closing bell on Wall Street on Thursday.\n\n(Reuters contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple \"well-positioned\" to benefit from AI despite DeepSeek emergence, Baird says\n\nNextEra Energy's XPLR Infrastructure shares tank on dividend suspension\n\nS&P, Nasdaq eye higher open as AI stocks recover, earnings roll in\n\nView Comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer\u2019s Bold Predictions About These 12 AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about.\n\nGiven that AI has dominated stock market headlines for more than a year now, it\u2019s no surprise that Jim Cramer of CNBC\u2019s Mad Money and Squawk on the Street has also devoted quite a bit of airtime discussing the technology. He is extremely bullish on AI and has gone as far as to suggest that the world\u2019s largest AI GPU company, the one run by Jensen Huang, is ushering in a new industrial revolution.\n\nDon\u2019t believe us? Well, take a look at his own words. In a recent Squawk on the Street appearance, Cramer said the following about Huang and his company:\n\n\u201cIndustrial revolution, why can\u2019t we believe? Do you remember, did you read that, book about John Garfield, where they talked about the telephone, and Alexander Graham Bell tries to get it into the centennial in Philadelphia, and only because the Brazilian guy there doesn\u2019t get to represent it. And Alexander Graham Bell says you know this could revolutionize all of how we do things. And the American judges were like who is this clown?\u201d\n\nOne major AI announcement in January that has created quite a bit of a splash is President Trump\u2019s $500 billion Stargate project. Trump announced the project joined by executives from several big tech companies. Cramer believes that Stargate might end up underpinning industrial growth in the US. Stargate might also require the US to build the energy infrastructure necessary to support massive data centers. According to Cramer:\n\n\u201cCrisis comes down to the fact that we had no real industrial growth in this country for decades so we haven\u2019t had to build much energy infrastructure. Now all of a sudden these data centers start coming online like the ones that will be part of Stargate, the Oracle, SoftBank, OpenAI project\u2026 And these data centers consume insane amounts of electricity. It\u2019s a level of demand that nobody saw coming. So after years where we spent more time decommissioning power plants and building new ones, we suddenly gotta go back into growth mode.\u201d\n\nThese aren\u2019t his only comments about Stargate. Cramer believes that the announcement might underlie a new paradigm shift in the US ecosystem. This ecosystem blossomed through the partnership between Bill Gates\u2019 software company and OpenAI. However, Cramer believes that the shares of one of the world\u2019s largest enterprise resource planning companies soared after the announcement because \u201cmaybe because there\u2019s a reshuffling of the alliance. And the alliance could be in play.\u201d He believes that \u201cthe fluid nature of things here is rather extraordinary\u201d and that the firm might have replaced the software company:\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201c[the ERP provider] might have replaced Microsoft in an OpenAI joint venture. This would be extraordinary. And you know Carl, I don\u2019t know whether Ellison [Larry Ellison] was doing a dance yesterday because he was so happy about this announcement. Or because he may have a real coup here. And betting against Ellison has been one of the biggest fools game in history. Man he was on his game yesterday.\u201d\n\nThe booming demand for energy from AI data centers has injected fresh life into nuclear power companies. Some of these firms are up by a whopping 186% year-to-date. While Cramer is skeptical about the near-term returns offered by nuclear power stocks, one energy source that he believes might become popular again is coal. Here\u2019s what he said in a recent Mad Money episode:\n\n\u201cUnder this president, coal could have\u2026 a renaissance. Sure, coal\u2019s time has come and gone, but it will come again because the data center inspired energy crisis really is so pressing that there\u2019s not really a choice anymore. Yes, the demand is that great, [and] we so foolishly mothballed good nuke plants that it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if coal\u2019s long decline may have finally run its course.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of Jim Cramer\u2019s bold predictions about AI stocks, we scanned the stocks he mentioned in Mad Money and Squawk on the Street as far back as September 2024. Then, we picked out AI stocks and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q3 2024.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Jim Cramer Explains Why It\u2019s the \u2018Quarterback of Your Portfolio\u2019 - Here\u2019s Why\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nDate of Cramer\u2019s Comments: 09-05-24\n\nPerformance Since Then: 0.18%\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the largest consumer electronics company in the world. Since Cramer\u2019s comments in September, the stock has been flat and has added a negligible 0.18%. However, this doesn\u2019t mean that the actual performance has been lackluster. Between September and late December, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares gained a respectable 16.5%. Since then, they have lost 14% on the back of analyst downgrades and a report suggesting that iPhone shipments in China fell by 17% in 2024. Loop Capital\u2019s downgrade to Hold from Buy with a $230 price target (down from an earlier $275) along with bearishness from Jefferies haven\u2019t helped the case either. Here\u2019s what Cramer said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in September:\n\n\u201cIn fantasy football, what you want is steady production and solid performance week in and week out. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve long said that Apple, the original \u201cown it, don\u2019t trade it\u201d stock, is like the quarterback of your portfolio. Last year, I said Patrick Mahomes from the Chiefs was the Apple of the NFL, and that analogy worked pretty darn well, as he led the Chiefs to their third Super Bowl victory in four years. Meanwhile, Apple is up more than 20%.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of AI stocks that Jim Cramer has made predictions about. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

On one hand, Jim Cramer views Apple as a reliable \"quarterback\" for a portfolio, suggesting stability and consistent performance. However, the article also highlights recent underperformance, including a 14% drop due to analyst downgrades and concerns about iPhone shipments in China. While the article mentions AI and Cramer's bullishness on the sector, it doesn't directly link Apple's AI capabilities to a significant positive catalyst. The article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer better returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic but acknowledges recent headwinds and the potential for other AI investments to outperform Apple. Given the recent negative performance and the lack of a strong, immediate AI-related catalyst, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise."

The article focuses more on other AI-related stocks and Cramer's broader views on the AI market and energy infrastructure.  The recent negative performance and analyst downgrades outweigh the general positive sentiment towards Apple as a long-term hold. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short term, based solely on this news."

        "content": "The number of investors with \u00a31 million or more in their stocks and shares individual savings account (ISA) is on the rise, according to Hargreaves Lansdown's (HL.L) platform data, which revealed where they are putting their money.\n\nThe UK's biggest investment platform said there were 1,322 \"ISA millionaires\" on its platform as of the end of December.\n\nThe figure was up 14% over the previous six months alone and was much higher when compared to the 168 ISA millionaires on the platform seven years ago, with just three recorded in 2012.\n\nHL found that the average age of an ISA millionaire on its platform was now 72 years old, down from 74 six months ago. However, the gender split of ISA millionaires had not changed from two years ago, with just over two-thirds found to be men.\n\n\"Some people get into investment in the hope of getting rich quick, but the vast majority of ISA millionaires have built a fortune through the far more reliable approach of getting rich slow,\" said Kate Marshall, lead investment analyst at HL.\n\nRead more: Key investment themes to watch in 2025\n\n\"They don\u2019t necessarily take enormous risks: many consistently invest as much as possible of their annual allowance, in a diverse and balanced portfolio, every year, for decades.\"\n\nMarshall pointed out that the top 10 stocks bought by this group were dominated by UK-listed blue-chip companies, including those that have traditionally paid strong dividends.\n\n\"It means most of them aren\u2019t speculating,\" she said. \"They\u2019re not in a hurry to trade them regularly either as, while most ISA millionaires traded in 2024, this has tended to be infrequent.\"\n\nAs for the most bought funds, Marshall said ISA millionaires were investing in a broad international mix of popular funds. Half of these funds were focused on a diversified mix of global companies, though there were also a couple of UK funds on the list, including an income fund.\n\n\"This reflects that as investors get older, some of the portfolio may have been reconfigured for income,\" she said.\n\n\"When you have a larger portfolio, you have more scope to add specialist funds into the mix, which is why we see a technology and India fund in the list of popular investments. Investors with a larger portfolio may be willing to take more risks, partly as they may have more scope for loss, or have sufficient stores of value elsewhere, such as cash ISAs, savings accounts, or annuities.\"\n\nHere's more detail on which were the most popular stocks and funds with HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLegal & General Group (LGEN.L)\n\nFinancial services company Legal & General Group was one name on the list, despite its shares trading nearly 8% in the red on a one-year basis.\n\nIn December, the firm said it was planning to return capital to investors and was on track to meet financial targets. L&G said it was on track to deliver mid-single digital growth in operating profit for the 2024 fiscal year, in line with guidance\n\nOperating profit in its half-year results came in at \u00a3920m ($1.14bn), slightly below the \u00a3924m it delivered in the first half of 2023. Profit after tax attributable to shareholders was down 41% to \u00a3223m.\n\nHowever, L&G raised its half-year dividend by 5% to 6p per share. The company's full-year results are due out on 12 March.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(LGEN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBP (BP.L)\n\nAnother big name on the list was BP, though shares in the oil major are down nearly 10% on a one-year basis.\n\nIn October, BP posted its weakest quarterly profit in nearly four years. The oil major reported a nearly 30% slump in underlying replacement cost profit to $2.3bn (\u00a31.85bn) in the third quarter. Underlying replacement cost profit is the metric BP uses as its version of net income.\n\nBP attributed the fall in net income in the third quarter to factors such as weaker realised refining margins and a poor oil trading result.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nDespite worse quarterly results, BP announced a share buyback of $1.75bn as part of its commitment to announce $3.5bn in purchases in the second half of the year. BP also declared a dividend of $0.08 per share, though that is still much lower than its peak payout of $0.105.\n\nOil prices have been under pressure over concerns about weaker demand and geopolitical tensions, which has pushed brent crude (BZ=F) back below $78 per barrel.\n\nBP's fourth quarter results and its latest dividend announcement are due out on 11 February.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(BP.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nRio Tinto (RIO.L)\n\nMiner Rio Tinto also made HL's list of the most-bought stocks by ISA millionaires. While the stock is down nearly 12% over the past year, it recently ticked up slightly on reports that it had been in talks with Glencore (GLEN.L) about a potential merger, though discussions were said to no longer be active.\n\nIn its recently released fourth quarter production results, Rio Tinto said its mined copper production was up 13% in 2024 on the previous year.\n\nCEO Jakob Stausholm said in an interview with the Financial Times last week that US president Donald Trump will give the green light to the company's copper mine in Arizona.\n\n\"I do think that we have really good chances now to progress that project,\" he said. It comes after a long battle over permits for the mine.\n\nThe Resolution mine would be the biggest copper mine in North America once completed, capable of producing as much as 25% of US copper demand each year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(RIO.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nISA millionaire top funds\n\nFive Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) index funds were among those most bought by HL's ISA millionaires.\n\nThis included the Legal & General Global Technology Index Trust (0P000023MW.L), which tracks the performance of the FTSE World \u2013 Technology index.\n\nThe \u00a33.8bn fund is up nearly 38% over the past year, with its top holdings including iPhone maker Apple (AAPL) and chipmaker Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nAnother popular fund with ISA millionaires was Jupiter India (0P0000U20R.L), which has delivered a return of 24% over one year. This return was ahead of its target benchmark of the 13% return from the MSCI India index with net dividends re-invested.\n\nStocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio\n\nThe biggest sectors the fund is allocated to are financials and healthcare. Its biggest holdings include tobacco manufacturer Godfrey Phillips India (GODFRYPHLP.NS) and private hospital network Fortis Healthcare (FORTIS.NS).\n\nArtemis Income (0P0000KKC3.L), which invests in UK companies, was also named on HL's list. The fund has produced a return of 15% over one year, beating the FTSE All-Share's (0P00000CNT.L) 9.5%.\n\nFinancials also make up the biggest share of sector exposure in this fund, followed by consumer discretionary and staples firms.\n\nTop holdings include Pearson (PSON.L), which provides educational materials and technology, along with private equity investment trust 3i Group (III.L).\n\nRead more:\n\n6 crypto developments in 2025 that will keep fuelling bitcoin's rally Best fund picks for investing in a Trump 2.0 presidency Five ways to save on the cost of having children\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.\n\nView Comments",

Given that ISA millionaires tend to invest for the long term and favor stable, dividend-paying stocks, this could indicate a positive outlook for AAPL. However, without specific catalysts or negative news directly affecting Apple, the probabilities of significant movement are moderate. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive investment sentiment but also acknowledge the potential for a fall due to market volatility or external factors."

The article lacks direct news about Apple's performance or prospects. While the fund's success might suggest some positive sentiment towards technology stocks, including AAPL, this is a weak signal. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly centered around 0.5, reflecting the lack of direct Apple-specific information.  The consensus leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise due to the positive performance of the fund holding AAPL, but the effect is expected to be small. The indirect nature of the news and the lack of significant new information about Apple itself limit the potential impact on its stock price.  Considering the consistent trend of slightly positive predictions in previous rounds, and the weak positive signal from the news, I'm assigning a probability slightly above 0.5 for a price rise, acknowledging the possibility of a fall due to other market factors."

        "headline": "What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year",
        "content": "Over 26% of Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is invested in Apple stock, which he has owned since 2016 and is still his largest holding; however, he has sold over 615 million shares of Apple in the past four quarters.\n\nOvervalued and Tax Concerns\n\nApple has traditionally been a high-flying quality stock with a vast moat, an exemplary capital allocation strategy, and a tactical product rollout. Still, the stock has been heavily overvalued since late 2023, with a current value hovering around 20% over GuruFocus's calculated fair market value of $189.29. Furthermore, Buffett's nearly 25% share reduction during September was more likely due to tax considerations. During the Berkshire Hathaway annual meeting in May, Buffett stated that he expected future tax rates to rise.\n\nTentative with Technology\n\nAnother reason for selling may be that Buffett is less comfortable with technology companies than his late partner, Charlie Munger, as Berkshire started offloading shares shortly after Charlie passed away in November 2023. Before his passing, Munger emphasized the importance of owning stocks like Apple and Alphabet, acknowledging their dominance and consistent outperformance in the market.\n\nDominos Investment\n\nBuffett's Apple sales have generated nearly $25 billion, giving Berkshire Hathaway a large cash pile for other investments. Fifty-five million of that cash has been invested in high-quality Domino's Pizza, representing approximately 3.7% of company shares. This solid-value, non-technology franchise business may appeal more to Buffett than his existing overinflated Apple stock. The stock is trading slightly below Guru Focus's fair market value estimate of $428.28, with an overall score of 92 and a profitability rank of 10 out of 10. Domino's share price is expected to rise approximately 10% in the next 12 months versus Apple's, which is predicted to increase by less than 1%. Domino's fortressing strategy, global master franchise agreements, Pulse POS system, and recently upgraded customer loyalty program have helped the company expand globally and drive domestic carryout traffic. The company is the prominent market leader in the quick-service restaurant (QSR) pizza business and outperformed Papa John's and Pizza Hut (owned by Yum Brands) in 2024. The company has an impressive 56% ROIC, contrasting sharply with a meager 9.95% WACC, suggesting the company is effectively allocating capital and accreting value despite a heavy debt burden.\n\nDomino's debt burden is reflected in the company's long history of negative debt-to-equity and equity-to-asset ratios. However, these metrics align with Papa John's and Yum Brands in this competitive, capital-intensive industry. With its huge cash pile, Berkshire Hathaway's interest in the company may help alleviate investor concerns. Domino's paid investors a $1.51 per share dividend in September and has had a 20% dividend growth rate over the last 10 years. That policy may be questionable, given their negative equity history.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhat to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nDPZ Data by GuruFocus\n\nHere's how Domino's metrics currently stack up with competitors (Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Domino's Pizza Inc Yum Brands Inc (Pizza Hut) Papa John's International Inc Symbol DPZ YUM PZZA Industry Restaurants Restaurants Restaurants GF Score 92 87 74 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Wide Narrow Predictability Rank 4/10 1/10 1/10 GF Value Rank 7/10 9/10 4/10 GF Valuation  Fairly Valued Modestly Undervalued Significantly Undervalued Profitability Rank 10/10 9/10 8/10 Financial Strength 4/10 4/10 4/10 Growth Rank 9/10 7/10 5/10 GF Value 429.80 144.33 79.35 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 443.84 0.00 0.00 Price Target 483.07 144.17 57.73 Revenue 4,665.47 7,223.00 2,099.94 PE Ratio 26.27 23.42 12.50 PEG Ratio 2.07 4.36 0.61 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 27.96 28.81 16.89 PB Ratio 0.00 0.00 0.00 PS Ratio 3.22 4.94 0.56 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 30.09 26.10 23.93 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 24.37 21.96 9.69 EV-to-EBITDA 20.00 18.28 8.91 Debt-to-Equity -1.31 -1.46 -2.23 Interest Coverage 4.41 4.74 3.11 Current Ratio 1.71 1.37 0.80 ROIC % 56.18 39.80 15.10 WACC % 10.06 7.66 7.66 Gross Margin % 39.05 48.57 20.25 Operating Margin % 18.49 32.19 6.58 Net Margin % 12.26 21.13 4.51 ROE % Negative Equity Negative Equity Negative Equity ROA % 32.99 24.31 11.02 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate 5.50 13.30 14.10 Dividends per Share (TTM)  5.74 2.62 1.84 Dividend Yield % 1.41 2.14 5.11 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.35 0.51 0.70 FCF Yield % 3.38 3.91 4.20 Buyback Yield % 1.85 0.93 0.00\n\nApple's Short and Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple's stock rose more than 30% in 2024 and is trading at all-time highs. Many fear the stock may lose momentum, as reflected in Guru Focus's flat share price target for the next 12 months. However, Apple investors might not want to unload their stock just yet.\n\nNear-term prospects are mixed due to geopolitical risks related to Apple's supply chain in China and Taiwan. With Trump's return to office, we might see a continuation of his previous trade policies, which previously have included tariffs on Chinese products and stricter enforcement of trade agreements.\n\nApple also has antitrust concerns. Since Google is the default search engine on Safari, Apple has taken an interest in the Department of Justice versus Google case, which may negatively impact Apple's ability to provide premium products to users. Weakened consumer spending may exacerbate these problems.\n\nHowever, the release of the new iPhone 16, the Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4 holds some promise that the stock may maintain a similar 2024 trajectory, including record revenues of 9.4 billion, a 6% year-over-year increase, and a 12% earnings increase. Apple is also developing a proprietary cellular modem, expected to roll out in 2025, starting with the iPhone SE and even eventually moving to premium models by 2027. This vertical integration strategy is expected to drive margin expansion.\n\nWith the adoption of Apple Intelligence, Apple's latest artificial intelligence system, introduced at the company's tradeshow, Worldwide Developers Conference 2024, dedicated Apple users are expected to upgrade their current iPhone models in 2026. The company is also expected to have an 11.4% compounded annual growth rate in service revenue through fiscal year 2027. For these reasons, Morgan Stanley forecasts a 12.3% revenue growth and earnings per share of $8.52 for 2026.\n\nThe Stalwart Parent\n\nCautious investors can't go wrong with Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway. Berkshire Hathaway shows moderate short-term gain potential with strong financial health and profitability metrics. Net margin, return on assets, return on equity, and return on invested capital indicate strong financial health compared to the S&P 500. The company had a record $325.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of Q3 2024, up from $276.9 billion at the end of June 2024. Berkshire Hathaway A and B shares are priced slightly above Guru Focus's calculated values. Investment income trends for the company remain strong due to increased bond reinvestment rates and Berkshire also exhibits attractive long-term prospects due to consistent revenue and net income growth, improved financial health, and a diversified business model. Berkshire Hathaway is expected to earn over $23.00 per share by 2027 through 2029 and may also continue to benefit from strategic acquisitions.\n\nHowever, there are a few cracks in the armor. Operating earnings were $4.68 per share in the third quarter of 2024, a decline due to decreased underwriting income from industrywide catastrophes. The company has a history of rising debt and inconsistent per-share cash flow within the last 5 years.What to Expect in 2025 from Buffet's Apple Dump Last Year\n\nBRK.A Data by GuruFocus\n\nIn November 2024, CFRA downgraded its rating on Berkshire Hathaway's Class B shares from 'Buy' to 'Hold,' attributing the decision to lower EPS estimates and revenue forecasts caused by widespread declines in operating revenues and insurance premiums.\n\nMorningstar lowered Berkshire Hathaway's moat rating from wide to narrow due to several factors. They observed signs of slippage in the railroad business and increased litigation exposure for the utilities/energy business, which have put downward pressure on excess returns for the noninsurance operations. Moreover, following Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s inevitable departure, the company will likely find it challenging to replicate the historic advantages he provided, making it harder for Berkshire to achieve superior returns consistently over the next decade.\n\nBelow is a comparison of significant metrics for the three main companies discussed in this report (BRK.A & BRK.B refer to the same company but have slightly different metrics due to market fluctuations; Data as of January 17, 2025):\n\nCompany Apple Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Berkshire Hathaway Inc Domino's Pizza Inc Symbol AAPL BRK.A BRK.B DPZ Industry Hardware Insurance Insurance Restaurants GF Score 96 72 69 92 Morningstar Moat Rating Wide Narrow Narrow Wide Predictability Rank 5 Stars 1 Star 1 Star 4 Stars GF Value Rank 5/10 5/10 3/10 7/10 GF Valuation Modestly Overvalued Modestly Overvalued Significantly Overvalued Fairly Valued Profitability Rank 10/10 6/10 6/10 10/10 Financial Strength 6/10 7/10 7/10 4/10 Growth Rank 10/10 2/10 2/10 9/10 GF Value 189.76 564,060.75 353.49 429.80 Intrinsic Value: DCF (FCF Based) 144.50 0.00 0.00 443.84 Price Target 243.60 762,340.33 513.00 483.07 Revenue 391,035.00 452,954.00 452,954.00 4,665.47 PE Ratio 37.83 9.47 9.47 26.27 PEG Ratio 2.14 0.00 0.00 2.07 Price-to-Owner-Earnings 34.94 8.78 8.78 27.96 PB Ratio 61.05 1.61 1.61 0.00 PS Ratio 9.07 2.23 2.23 3.22 Price-to-Free-Cash-Flow 32.60 48.11 48.11 30.09 Price-to-Operating-Cash-Flow 30.00 25.06 25.06 24.37 EV-to-EBITDA 25.99 7.28 7.28 20.00 Debt-to-Equity 1.87 0.20 0.20 -1.31 Interest Coverage N/A 27.47 27.47 4.41 Current Ratio 0.87 0.00 0.00 1.71 ROIC % 32.51 10.65 10.65 56.18 WACC %  11.41 9.07 9.07 10.06 Gross Margin % 46.21 0.00 0.00 39.05 Operating Margin % 31.51 0.00 0.00 18.49 Net Margin % 23.97 23.60 23.60 12.26 ROE %  140.28 18.50 18.50 Negative Equity ROA % 26.93 9.87 9.87 32.99 3-Year Total EBITDA Growth Rate  3.00 25.10 25.10 5.50 Dividends per Share (TTM)  0.98 0.00 0.00 5.74 Dividend Yield % 0.43 0.00 0.00 1.41 Dividend Payout Ratio 0.15 0.00 0.00 0.35 FCF Yield % 3.15 2.08 2.08 3.38 Buyback Yield % 2.75 0.51 0.51 1.85\n\nGiven the current metrics of these three companies, Domino's appears to be the best value investment for those seeking a balance of growth potential and dividend yield. It is fairly valued with a significant expected price increase and offers a high dividend yield. Still, prospective investors should be wary of the company's high debt levels and negative equity.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is the clear winner for more risk-averse investors. The company has low PE and EV/EBITDA ratios and a nearly 70% margin of safety based on GuruFocus's discounted cash flow model. Still, these calculations may be highly unpredictable due to the company's narrowing moat, challenges in capital allocation, and inevitable leadership transition.\n\nTake-Aways\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway significantly reduced its Apple holdings, selling over 615 million shares due to concerns about Apple's overvaluation and future tax rates. This shift reflects Buffett's cautious stance on technology stocks following the passing of his partner, Charlie Munger.\n\nThe proceeds from these sales have been partially reinvested in Domino's Pizza, a high-quality, non-technology franchise that aligns more closely with Buffett's investment philosophy.\n\nDespite Apple's strong performance and promising product rollouts, its overvaluation and geopolitical risks present challenges. Meanwhile, Berkshire Hathaway faces headwinds such as decreased underwriting income, rising debt, and a narrowing moat, compounded by the impending leadership transition post-Buffett. Domino's Pizza emerges as a compelling value investment, offering a balance of growth potential and dividend yield despite its high debt levels.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

On the negative side, Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple holdings signals concerns about overvaluation and potential tax increases. Buffett's shift towards Domino's, a non-tech company, further suggests a lack of confidence in Apple's future growth. Geopolitical risks, antitrust concerns, and potential weakening consumer spending also pose challenges. However, the upcoming release of new iPhone and Apple Watch models, the development of a proprietary cellular modem, and the adoption of Apple Intelligence offer potential for growth. Morgan Stanley's forecast of revenue and EPS growth in 2026 provides a positive counterpoint. Considering these factors, the negative signals from Buffett's actions and the overvaluation concerns outweigh the potential positive catalysts in the short term. Therefore, there is a higher probability of a stock price fall."

                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Warren Buffett's significant reduction of Apple holdings and his investment in Domino's Pizza.  Buffett's actions are attributed to Apple's overvaluation, tax concerns, and a shift away from technology stocks following the death of Charlie Munger. While Apple's future prospects are mixed (new product releases vs. geopolitical risks and antitrust concerns), the article highlights the overvaluation as a key factor in Buffett's decision.  The article also presents a positive outlook for Domino's, but this is not directly relevant to Apple's stock price movement.  Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price falling is higher than rising, primarily due to the negative sentiment stemming from Buffett's sell-off and the acknowledgement of overvaluation.  However, the probability of a rise isn't zero, given Apple's strong recent performance and upcoming product launches. The probabilities are assigned based on a qualitative assessment of the news and its potential impact, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in stock market predictions."

                    "reasoning": "The analysis of the financial news suggests mixed signals for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple is overvalued by approximately 20% according to GuruFocus, and Warren Buffett's significant reduction in holdings (26% of his portfolio) due to tax concerns and discomfort with technology stocks post-Charlie Munger's passing could signal a lack of confidence. Additionally, geopolitical risks, antitrust concerns, and potential weakening consumer spending add to the negative outlook. On the other hand, Apple's strong product pipeline (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4), the development of a proprietary cellular modem, and the adoption of Apple Intelligence could sustain revenue growth and margin expansion. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is tempered by the overvaluation and Buffett's sell-off, while the probability of a fall is supported by these same concerns but offset by Apple's strong fundamentals and growth prospects."

While the significant sale of Apple shares by Warren Buffett is a major negative, indicating concerns about overvaluation and potential tax implications, it's crucial to consider the context. Buffett's actions are partly driven by tax considerations and a shift in investment strategy, not necessarily a complete loss of faith in Apple's long-term prospects.  Apple's strong fundamentals, including new product releases and potential for margin expansion through vertical integration, counterbalance the negative sentiment.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning bearish, but not overwhelmingly so.  Considering the overvaluation, geopolitical risks, and antitrust concerns, a price decline is more likely in the short term. However, the long-term prospects remain positive, suggesting a less dramatic fall than some predictions might suggest.  The overall uncertainty warrants a probability closer to the middle ground than the extreme bearish predictions."

However, Apple's strong fundamentals, including new product releases (iPhone 16, Apple Watch Series 10, AirPods 4), potential margin expansion from a proprietary cellular modem, and the adoption of Apple Intelligence, offer counterbalancing positive factors. Morgan Stanley's positive 2026 forecast also provides some optimism.  The previous predictions consistently show a bearish bias, with most models predicting a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the weight of negative factors (Buffett's sell-off, overvaluation, geopolitical risks) against the positive factors (new products, potential margin expansion), a price decline is more likely in the short term.  However, the long-term prospects, supported by strong fundamentals and new product launches, suggest a less dramatic fall than some predictions might suggest.

        "headline": "Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Jim Cramer Discusses These 13 Stocks & Rejects The AI PC Super Cycle. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against stocks that Jim Cramer discusses.\n\nIn a fresh appearance on CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer commented in quite a bit of detail on artificial intelligence and AI PCs. AI, the technology that has caught the investing world by storm, has two facets. The first covers enterprise computing with cloud computing services such as Azure and AWS offering businesses new AI tools for their tasks. The second is the consumer end, dominated primarily via chatbots and services like the Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s R1 and OpenAI\u2019s o1.\n\nAnother aspect of AI that received quite a lot of attention last year was AI PCs. These computers use hardware designed to run artificial intelligence workloads. This hardware includes graphics processing units (GPUs) and neural processing units (NPUs), which means that their price tag is often higher than a standard computer.\n\nOn top of Cramer\u2019s mind was a recent Morgan Stanley consumer survey report which analyzed consumer sentiment with respect to a super-cycle in AI-enabled products. The bank revealed that just 15% of the 400 respondents bought some of the products primarily because they wanted to access AI. The bank added that 60% of respondents inadvertently bought an AI PC and more than 60% shared that they would not pay extra for AI products.\n\nCommenting on the research, Cramer started by sharing \u201cI think the AI hardware super cycle Morgan Stanley piece is perhaps the most damming piece I\u2019ve read.\u201d According to him, the research was striking \u201cBecause there\u2019s absolutely no evidence of a super cycle whatsoever.\u201d The CNBC host shifted towards enterprise AI use cases and was appreciative of them. \u201cI mean I think AI is very good when you listen to what Jamie Dimon [inaudible] to say, that AI is very good when you listen to what Marc Benioff has to say,\u201d he outlined.\n\nHowever, while AI has impressed business users, Cramer admitted to being wrong about consumer demand for AI PCs. \u201cBut the PC, I thought we were all gonna upgrade. And now we\u2019re all in wait-and-see mode,\u201d he shared. Cramer added that those he knew who have bought an AI PC \u201chaven\u2019t used it or there\u2019s a button there and it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nYet, even though consumer interest in AI PCs might be lackluster, Cramer is still an AI believer. He revealed that \u201cI use it [ChatGPT] every day.\u201d One ChatGPT use case he likes is comparing drugs. \u201cAnd you start at ChatGPT. You really do. And it\u2019s very authoritative and it tells you who to go to. And I think it\u2019s extraordinary. It\u2019s an extraordinarily good product,\u201d according to Cramer.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn fact, Cramer\u2019s \u201con ChatGPT maybe five times before I come down here. Ten times before I do Mad Money. There\u2019s nothing I don\u2019t run through. Because I don\u2019t want to make a mistake.\u201d However, he did add that while ChatGPT is great, this doesn\u2019t mean \u201cthat it\u2019s not hallucinating.\u201d Yet, Cramer still suggests \u201c. . anyone use it before they buy a stock. It\u2019s that good.\u201d\n\nHis praise for ChatGPT isn\u2019t the first time that Cramer\u2019s shared opinions on AI. In a recent CNBC morning appearance, he outlined some enterprise AI use cases. Cramer shared:\n\n\u201cHealthcare\u2019s gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it\u2019s not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there\u2019s a call center that\u2019s better.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 23rd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Jim Cramer Addresses Concerns Around Apple (AAPL) and Why Consensus Estimates Matter\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s shares have not seen much love from investors in 2025. Wall Street doesn\u2019t believe that the firm\u2019s consumer AI initiatives are attracting consumers and multiple reports have claimed that its flagship iPhone is struggling in China. Cramer has discussed Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s stock several times this year. He believes that investors focus too much on the iPhone with regard to the firm\u2019s hypothesis and holds the opinion that the commonly held belief of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) missing upcoming earnings means that the miss won\u2019t be a surprise. Here are his latest remarks:\n\n\u201cAnother guy, the Goldman guy, said look, I\u2019m below the consensus. Well you know what the consensus is full of Apple. It doesn\u2019t matter anymore.\u00a0 The consensus is, like why don\u2019t we just get the consensus to move so when it disappoints, it doesn\u2019t disappoint as badly. And remember, what people always talk about, it\u2019s not this quarter. It\u2019s the \u2018estimate cut that I know that nobody else knows.\u2019 Everyone knows that there\u2019s going to be an estimate cut.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer discusses. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article also highlights that other AI stocks may offer better returns.

He points to a Morgan Stanley survey showing low consumer interest in AI-specific products and suggests that the consensus earnings estimates for Apple are already factoring in potential disappointments.  This suggests a cautious outlook on Apple's short-term performance, although not necessarily a negative one.  The article also highlights that Cramer believes the market is already anticipating a potential earnings miss, reducing the impact of any negative surprise.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly negative, but the lack of strong negative sentiment and the acknowledgement of AI's potential in other sectors mitigates the potential for a significant price drop.  The probability of a price rise is lower due to the cautious outlook, but the probability of a fall is also not high due to the already factored-in expectations."

The market's anticipation of a potential earnings miss, as suggested by Cramer, might mitigate some negative impact, but the overall sentiment remains cautious. Considering the trend of previous predictions leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, and the lack of significant positive catalysts in the news, a slightly pessimistic outlook is still warranted. The slight adjustment towards a more neutral stance in some previous predictions suggests a degree of uncertainty, but the core concerns persist."

        "content": "Investing.com -- The stock market suffered a sharp sell-off Monday, with the S&P 500 dropping 1.46% and the Nasdaq falling 3% after Chinese startup DeepSeek\u2019s AI breakthrough sparked concerns over lower AI-related spending.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America believe that the pullback created idiosyncratic buy opportunities in certain stocks. They highlighted Corning Incorporated (NYSE:GLW), Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co (NYSE:HPE), Western Digital (NASDAQ:WDC), and Seagate Technology PLC (NASDAQ:STX), noting that \u201ceach name has compelling growth drivers separate from Gen AI/datacenter spending.\u201d\n\nBofA also likes Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and IBM (NYSE:IBM), citing their defensive nature and potential for growth amid market volatility.\n\nApple is one of the rare technology stocks that rose higher on Monday.\n\n\u201cOn a day when AI stocks were down double-digit percent, Apple shares were up 3% as investors realize the potential for edge AI and there is a flight to safety driven by Apple\u2019s earnings resiliency,\u201d analysts led by Wamsi Mohan noted.\n\n\u201cIf DeepSeek is truly able to lower the cost of AI inferencing and better models are developed faster and cheaper, then edge AI applications and Apple as the edge device maker, stands to benefit. We view Apple as the ultimate play on having an LLM in your pocket,\u201d they added.\n\nBofA analysts believe several key drivers could drive upside in the tech giant\u2019s shares, such as the expected launch of the iPhone SE in March or April, insourcing of modem production to improve gross margins, the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June that may feature AI-driven use cases, and the release of the iPhone 17 in September 2025.\n\nFor IBM, BofA highlighted catalysts including a new mainframe cycle, acceleration in its Software (ETR:SOWGn) division, and mergers and acquisitions activity. Analysts project higher growth in Software for the next three years, driven by Enterprise AI opportunities and the launch of a new Mainframe (z17) in 2025.\n\n\u201cFor IBM, AI represents an opportunity in its Consulting business as it seeks to position itself as the go-to partner of choice for AI consulting.\n\nCorning's stock fell by 8.7% on Monday, but BofA analysts point out multiple key drivers that could foster recovery and growth.

        "content": "A Look Back at Consumer Electronics Stocks\u2019 Q3 Earnings: Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) Vs The Rest Of The Pack\n\nThe end of an earnings season can be a great time to discover new stocks and assess how companies are handling the current business environment. Let\u2019s take a look at how Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) and the rest of the consumer electronics stocks fared in Q3.\n\nConsumer electronics companies aim to address the evolving leisure and entertainment needs of consumers, who are increasingly familiar with technology in everyday life. Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady. On average, they are relatively unchanged since the latest earnings results.\n\nSonos (NASDAQ:SONO)\n\nA pioneer in connected home audio systems, Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) offers a range of premium wireless speakers and sound systems.\n\nSonos reported revenues of $255.4 million, down 16.3% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.8%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates.\n\n\u201cThanks to our team going all-in on our app recovery efforts, we made significant progress in bringing the quality of our software to a level that we\u2019re all proud of, which enabled us to launch our highly anticipated new products, Arc Ultra and Sub 4, in time for the holidays,\u201d Sonos CEO Patrick Spence commented.Sonos Total Revenue\n\nSonos scored the biggest analyst estimates beat but had the slowest revenue growth of the whole group. The results were likely priced in, however, and the stock is flat since reporting. It currently trades at $13.95.\n\nIs now the time to buy Sonos? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it\u2019s free.\n\nBest Q3: GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO)\n\nKnown for sponsoring extreme athletes, GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO) is a camera company known for its POV videos and editing software.\n\nGoPro reported revenues of $258.9 million, down 12% year on year, outperforming analysts\u2019 expectations by 1.5%. The business had an exceptional quarter with an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates.\n\nStory Continues\n\nGoPro Total Revenue\n\nAlthough it had a fine quarter compared its peers, the market seems unhappy with the results as the stock is down 28.7% since reporting. It currently trades at $1.04.\n\nIs now the time to buy GoPro? Access our full analysis of the earnings results here, it\u2019s free.\n\nWeakest Q3: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nCreator of the iPhone and shepherd of the App Store, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a legendary developer of consumer electronics and software.\n\nApple reported revenues of $94.93 billion, up 6.1% year on year, exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations by 0.5%. It was a mixed quarter:\u00a0Despite roughly in line revenue, it was encouraging to see Apple top analysts\u2019 operating income expectations this quarter. On the other hand, the all-important Services segment missed on the revenue line.\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 2% since the results and currently trades at $229.90.\n\nRead our full analysis of Apple\u2019s results here.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year. This result surpassed analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.5%. It was a very strong quarter as it also produced EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations and an impressive beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.\n\nThe stock is up 23.7% since reporting and currently trades at $8.22.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Peloton here, it\u2019s free.\n\nMarket Update\n\nThanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 5 Quality Compounder Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

While revenue exceeded expectations and operating income was encouraging, the Services segment missed revenue targets. The stock is already up 2% since the results were released, suggesting some positive sentiment is already priced in. The overall market update mentions rate cuts and a surge after Trump's election, but also highlights uncertainty for 2025. Given the mixed results and existing price increase, further significant upside is less likely in the short term. The market uncertainty also adds to the downside risk. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a significant rise."

However, the overall tone of the article is not specifically focused on Apple's performance, but rather a broader overview of the consumer electronics sector. The macroeconomic factors mentioned (rate cuts, Trump's election) are likely to have a larger impact on Apple's stock price than the specific Q3 earnings report detailed in this article. Given the positive market reaction already observed and the generally positive macroeconomic environment described, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall, but the impact of this specific news is relatively minor."

Despite this, the stock has risen 2% since the results were announced, indicating a positive market reaction. Given the overall strong performance of the consumer electronics sector in Q3 and Apple's ability to exceed revenue and operating income expectations, the market sentiment appears favorable.

        "headline": "Nasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - Nasdaq futures inched up on Tuesday, after a steep sell-off in technology stocks in the prior session that stemmed from concerns over the impact of the success of Chinese firm DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost AI model on Big Tech spending plans. Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) edged higher in extended hours trading after the AI-darling\u2019s stock price plummeted on Monday. Elsewhere, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman speaks out on DeepSeek\u2019s model, calling it \"impressive\".\n\n1. Nasdaq futures point higher after China AI model sparks steep sell-off\n\nThe Nasdaq futures contract pointed higher on Tuesday, following a day of sharp declines in the tech-heavy index after due to worries that a spike in notoriety of a cut-price Chinese artificial intelligence model could dent US AI leaders.\n\nBy 03:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had risen by 55 points or 0.3%, while S&P 500 futures were mostly unchanged and Dow futures had ticked down by 96 points or 0.2%.\n\nShares in Nvidia rose in extended hours trading, clawing back some of its steep losses on Monday. The chipmaking giant and poster child of the AI boom slumped by 16.8%, erasing nearly $600 billion in stock market value -- its worst-ever drop.\n\nAn index of semiconductor stocks also slipped to its largest single-day percentage dip since March 2020, while major tech companies Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) retreated as well. The Nasdaq Composite shed 3.1% and the benchmark S&P 500 lost 1.5%.\n\nThe sell-off extended beyond chipmakers and into AI-adjacent stocks such as power utilities Vistra (NYSE:VST) and Constellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG), both of whom have been bolstered in recent months by expectations that they would see a spike in demand as companies race to power the data centers that underpin AI applications. Data center infrastructure builders fell too, with Vertiv Holdings (NYSE:VRT) decreasing by over 30%.\n\n2. Asian stocks skittish\n\nAsian stocks moved in a flat-to-low range on Tuesday, with Japanese markets leading losses as local chipmaking stocks were battered by the DeepSeek fallout.\n\nMarkets in China and South Korea were closed for the Lunar New Year holiday, with regional trading volumes expected to remain dull throughout the week because of several more regional holidays. Hong Kong markets firmed slightly ahead of an early close.\n\nBeyond DeepSeek, focus this week is also on a string of major U.S. tech earnings due in the coming days (more below). Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve is widely expected to hold interest rates steady at the conclusion of a two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. DeepSeek sparks doubt over AI spending outlook\n\nDenting sentiment on Monday was Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which has introduced a free new chatbot it says can rival the likes of OpenAI's ChatGPT, albeit with less data and at a fraction of the cost.\n\nThe firm said it took a mere two months and under $6 million to build out its AI model on Nvidia's lower-capability H800 chips. DeepSeek's assistant run on the model became the best-selling app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store on Monday, overtaking ChatGPT in downloads.\n\nAlthough doubts still surround DeepSeek's claims, the statement fueled worries that massive spending on AI by the US tech industry's biggest names was unwarranted. U.S. President Donald Trump said DeepSeek was a \"wake-up call\" for American companies.\n\nSome analysts have flagged that DeepSeek's model could upend the long-standing hype over AI that has fueled stocks to record highs over the past year-and-a-half, but others have argued that Monday's sell-off amounted to an over-reaction.\n\n\"DeepSeek now seems to show that we can do more with existing computing power than previously thought,\" analysts at ING said in a note to clients. \"The market, therefore, needs to price in a slower adoption rate of high-performance computing and revenues of companies selling AI models.\"\n\n4. DeepSeek's model looms over tech earnings\n\nThe emergence of Hangzhou-based DeepSeek's AI model comes ahead of a raft of quarterly results from mega-cap tech companies this week.\n\nEven before DeepSeek roiled global markets, investors were keen for Silicon Valley's largest tech companies to provide more insight into their already ballooning AI budgets.\n\nMany tech industry executives have previously argued that the spending was necessary to avoid falling behind in the AI arms race, which is projected to revolutionize a variety of aspects of modern life.\n\nFour of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" tech companies, which have been heavily responsible for recent stock market gains, are due to report this week. Meta (NASDAQ:META), software giant Microsoft and electric vehicle titan Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are scheduled to post results on Wednesday after the closing bell on Wall Street, followed by iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\n5. OpenAI's Altman on DeepSeek\n\nSam Altman said on Monday the DeepSeek AI model, known as R1, was impressive for what it could deliver at its current cost, but that OpenAI planned to deliver better models.\n\nAltman said more computing power still remained important as OpenAI executed its research plans, and that demand for AI is likely to remain strong\n\n\u201cDeepseek's R1 is an impressive model, particularly around what they're able to deliver for the price,\u201d Altman said in a post on X. The OpenAI CEO added that the company is \u201cexcited to continue to execute on our research roadmap and believe more compute is more important now than ever before to succeed at our mission\u201d.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures up after sell-off; Nvidia rises after-hours - what's moving markets\n\nUK's Foxtons 2024 earnings beat estimates on lettings business boost\n\nBOJ to raise rates again by July, eventually eye hike to 1.5%, says ex-policymaker\n\nView Comments",

While the DeepSeek AI model's success has caused a broad sell-off in tech stocks, impacting companies heavily invested in AI, Apple's direct exposure to this specific threat is limited.  The news focuses on the impact on AI-related hardware and software companies, and while Apple is involved in AI, it's not as directly exposed as Nvidia or companies heavily reliant on high-performance computing for AI development.  The fact that DeepSeek's app topped Apple's App Store could be viewed as either positive (demonstrating the App Store's reach and potential for AI app adoption) or negative (highlighting a potential competitor in the AI space).  However, Sam Altman's comments suggest that the long-term demand for AI and high-performance computing remains strong, which could ultimately benefit Apple in the long run.  The overall market reaction is uncertain, with Nasdaq futures inching up after a significant sell-off.  Given the mixed signals and Apple's relatively less direct exposure compared to other tech giants mentioned, the probability of a price rise or fall is considered relatively balanced, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the general market uncertainty and negative sentiment surrounding the AI sector."

While the emergence of DeepSeek's model has sparked concerns about the spending plans of Big Tech companies on AI, OpenAI's CEO has stated that DeepSeek's model is impressive but that more computing power is still important for AI research. Apple's App Store being used to download the AI model could be seen as a positive, indicating strong demand for AI applications on its platform. However, the overall market sentiment remains cautious due to fears of reduced AI spending.

DeepSeek's success on the App Store poses a competitive threat but also indicates strong demand for AI applications on Apple's platform. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman's comments suggest continued demand for AI technology, which could benefit Apple in the long run. Given these mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, the probability of a stock price rise or fall is considered relatively balanced but slightly skewed towards a negative short-term impact due to the broader market sell-off and concerns over AI spending.

The fact that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a large position in Apple is generally a positive signal, indicating confidence in the company's long-term prospects. Considering these factors, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a positive, but not overwhelmingly positive, stock price movement in the short term.

However, the news lacks specific, actionable information about Apple's current or future performance, products, or financials. The mention of Apple alongside Nvidia and AMD could be seen as both a positive association and a neutral one. Given the retrospective nature of the news and the lack of concrete details, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal but slightly skewed positive due to the favorable framing. The consensus from previous predictions leans toward a modest positive sentiment, with most models estimating a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall. Considering the overall sentiment and the lack of concrete details, I estimate a moderate probability of a price rise, slightly higher than the probability of a price fall."

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 35 Most Important AI Stocks for 2025 According to JPMorgan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nInvestors have become increasingly concerned about the rising capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, with many wondering whether the expectations embedded in financial markets today project a realistic path ahead. According to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan,\u00a0 investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega-cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025.\n\nThe Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now makes up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and has driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023. This performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on a 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nAnalysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. Hardware firms were defined as the companies that drive the design and manufacture of the semiconductors that are key to generating computing power. Hyperscalers were picked out as the companies that provide physical AI infrastructure such as cloud services and data centers, create custom silicon chips, and build large language models that can be used by other companies. AI developers were recognized as software companies that leverage hyperscaler technologies to provide solutions for end users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nAI integrators were pinned down as the larger organizations that have sufficient technology functionality to build their own AI solutions, as well as the IT services companies that support them. AI essentials were singled out as companies that are less directly impacted by the technology itself, but provide the resources that enable the whole AI value chain to work, whether that is energy, air conditioning, raw materials or even the data to train models. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain.\n\nThe report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility. The report further highlights that these categories are also likely to be the most exposed to escalating trade tensions between the US and China. The bank predicts ample opportunities for investors in the AI essentials and AI developers bucket over time.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank JPMorgan.

JPMorgan's report suggests that while Apple is a strong player, other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe.

Apple's ranking as the 6th most important AI stock by JPMorgan suggests a positive outlook, although the article also points out that other stocks may offer higher returns. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic regarding Apple's AI prospects, but doesn't provide a strong bullish signal. The fact that Apple is already a large-cap company with a high valuation means that the impact of this news on its stock price might be less dramatic than for smaller companies with higher growth potential.  Therefore, a moderate increase in probability is assigned, but the probability of a price fall is not negligible due to the broader market concerns mentioned."

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top 10 AI News You Shouldn\u2019t Miss. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss.\n\nAll everyone could talk about in the technical AI landscape these days is DeepSeek-R1, a Chinese open-source LLM that analysts believe can give major American AI companies a run for their money. Why is DeepSeek making waves and why is it called a breakthrough in the AI race?\n\nDeepSeek AI model is several times cheaper to use for professional purposes when compared to its American counterparts including OpenAI\u2019s o1 model. Media reports also suggest the model beat almost all key AI models in the industry by significant margins.\n\nCNBC\u2019s Deirdre Bosa explained what makes these Chinese models a challenge for US tech companies:\n\n\u201cThe cost, I mean, these models coming out of China are just built at a fraction of the price when you think about OpenAI. That\u2019s spending $5 billion a year, burning through billions of dollars a year. These models, the DeepSeek for example, they say they built it for less than $6 million. ByteDance as well, you know, shows that it was built and you can access it at much, much lower prices. So, this really turns on sort of this truth that we have thought about generative AI for the last few years\u2014that you need hundreds of millions of dollars to develop bigger and better models. What the Chinese labs and companies are doing is they\u2019re going straight to the frontier. They\u2019re building with sort of infrastructure and outputs that are already out there, built in many cases by American companies and startups, and they\u2019re improving on it, they\u2019re innovating on it, and producing models that are just as good, in some cases, at a fraction of the cost.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: 7 Best Stocks to Buy For Long-Term and 8 Cheap Jim Cramer Stocks to Invest In\n\nFor this article, we picked 10 AI stocks currently in the news. With each company we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Analyst on Apple (AAPL): \u2018I Don\u2019t Think AI is a Story Yet\u2019\n\nguteksk7/Shutterstock.com\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 158\n\nBonawyn Eison, Chief Investment Officer and Managing Partner, Wynsource Partners, recently said on CNBC that he does not believe AI would be a strong enough driver for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to take the company to the next level.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t understand what the real drivers of the super cycle are, and if AI is the catalyst behind it, I can understand that. They don\u2019t have the same cashback spend as some of the other MAGs, so there\u2019s a floor there. But in terms of what\u2019s going to take what is already a fully valued company to the next level and lead to, either for me, P/E expansion, I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet, or I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is desperately in need of new catalysts. The company\u2019s revenue in China fell 8% in fiscal year 2024, following a 2% decline the previous year. The Chinese market accounts for about 15% of Apple\u2019s total revenue, so this downtrend cannot be ignored.\n\nInvestors had hopes from the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, but so far its performance has been weak. Vision Pro faces tough competition from Meta\u2019s $500 Quest and the more affordable Quest 3S, making it hard to justify its $3,500 price tag. The failure of Apple\u2019s HomePod, unable to compete with Amazon\u2019s and Google\u2019s lower-priced offerings, further highlights the challenges in this market.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone 16 has not shown promising growth prospects yet and investors are still in a wait-and-see mode on the AI platform.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of top AI news you shouldn\u2019t miss. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article also points out challenges in the Chinese market, weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and unpromising growth prospects for the iPhone 16. The comparison to Chinese AI models being developed at a fraction of the cost further adds to the negative sentiment. The analyst's quote, 'I don\u2019t think AI is a story yet,' is a key indicator of potential investor skepticism.

The analyst's comment that AI is \"not a story yet\" for Apple suggests a lack of near-term catalysts related to AI.

The analyst, Bonawyn Eison, expresses skepticism about AI being a catalyst for Apple's growth, citing the company's fully valued status and the need for new catalysts. Additionally, Apple's recent financial performance, including an 8% decline in revenue in China, and weak performance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, contribute to the negative outlook. The article also mentions that Apple's high valuation and lack of promising growth prospects, such as the iPhone 16 and Vision Pro, may lead to a wait-and-see approach from investors. Overall, the analyst's comments and the company's current challenges suggest a higher likelihood of the stock price falling rather than rising."

This skepticism is reinforced by several factors: declining revenue in China, underperformance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and the lackluster reception of products like the Vision Pro and HomePod.  The comparison to cheaper, more effective Chinese AI models further adds to the negative sentiment.  Although the article mentions a high number of hedge fund investors, the overall tone suggests that other AI stocks might offer better short-term returns.  The consistent predictions from various AI models in previous rounds, all leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall, further supports this assessment.  While Apple's established position and diversified revenue streams might mitigate a drastic price drop, the lack of immediate positive catalysts makes a price fall more likely than a rise in the short term."

While Apple remains a strong company, the lack of positive catalysts and the prevailing bearish outlook suggest a downward trend in the short term. The previous rounds have consistently predicted a high probability of the stock falling, and there is no new information to suggest a significant change in this trend. I am maintaining the probability of a fall due to the continued negative sentiment and the lack of any counterbalancing positive news.

The core issue is the analyst's skepticism about AI's immediate impact on Apple's growth, coupled with several existing challenges: declining revenue in China, underperformance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment, and underwhelming reception of new products like the Vision Pro and HomePod.  The emergence of cheaper, competitive AI models from China further adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple's established position and diversified revenue streams might mitigate a drastic price drop, the lack of immediate positive catalysts and the consistent bearish predictions from various AI models across multiple rounds strongly suggest a higher probability of a price fall.  The high number of hedge fund investors is a positive factor, but it's outweighed by the immediate concerns highlighted in the news.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple rounds reinforces the prediction of a higher probability of a price fall.  Therefore, I am aligning my prediction with the consensus of the previous models, slightly increasing the probability of a fall to reflect the accumulating negative sentiment."

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) just flipped the script on a brutal AI sell-off, while Apple jumps more than 3.7% and Meta climbs 0.6% today's early afternoon, while the rest of Big Tech took a beating. The trigger? Chinese AI upstart DeepSeek unveiled a shockingly cost-effective AI model, sending ripples through the industry. Apple investors took it as a winsmaller, more efficient AI models mean better on-device AI for iPhones. Meanwhile, Meta's Mark Zuckerberg isn't backing down, signaling up to $65 billion in AI investments this year as the company races to build out its Llama model.\n\nAdding fuel to Apple's rally, JPMorgan raised its iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing better-than-expected demand out of China. The firm now expects Apple to churn out 48 million iPhones in Q1 2025, an 8% jump from previous forecasts, thanks to stronger orders for the upcoming iPhone SE4. Still, Apple's stock is 12% off its recent highs, weighed down by iPhone sales concerns and fresh downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital. All eyes are now on Apple's January 30 earnings report, where analysts are betting on a $126 billion quarterjust ahead of consensus.\n\nBut the real shocker? DeepSeek just rewrote the AI investment playbook. Its latest model reportedly cost just $5.6 million to trainpeanuts compared to OpenAI's $100 million bill for GPT-4. That's spooking investors in AI infrastructure-heavy plays like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), all of which tumbled as fears of AI cost deflation spread. The question now: Have the hyperscalers overplayed their hand, pouring billions into an AI arms race that might not be as expensive as everyone thought?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The raised iPhone build estimates by JPMorgan suggest improved sales expectations, which could lead to a positive earnings report.

Given these factors, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is higher than that of it falling."

JPMorgan's increased iPhone build estimates for 1H25, citing strong demand from China, further supports a positive outlook. However, Apple's stock is still 12% off its recent highs, and recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital indicate lingering concerns about iPhone sales. The upcoming earnings report on January 30 is a crucial event that could significantly influence the stock price. The DeepSeek news, while positive for Apple's on-device AI prospects, also introduces uncertainty about the overall AI investment landscape, which could indirectly affect Apple. Considering these factors, the positive catalysts seem to outweigh the negative ones in the short term, but the upcoming earnings report introduces significant uncertainty.

This is further supported by Apple's outperformance compared to other tech giants amidst concerns about AI cost deflation. However, counterbalancing these positives are lingering concerns about iPhone sales, reflected in recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, and the stock's current position 12% below recent highs. The upcoming earnings report will be crucial in determining investor sentiment. While the positive news regarding iPhone demand and the potential benefits of cheaper AI models are significant, the existing negative sentiment and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report prevent a strongly bullish prediction.  The overall impact of the DeepSeek news is positive for Apple, as it suggests a shift towards more efficient AI development, benefiting Apple's on-device AI strategy. However, the market reaction to this news is complex and not solely focused on Apple's prospects."

Its shares dropped 3.5pc in New York, knocking more than $119bn (\u00a395bn) off its valuation.\n\nWilliam Beavington of Jefferies said: \u201cWhat\u2019s particularly remarkable to us really is the cost effectiveness and the efficiency they have driven from the chips being used.\u201d\n\nChip making giant Nvidia was down 13pc, wiping nearly $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off the value of the world\u2019s dominant supplier of AI hardware and software. It had already closed down more than 3pc on Wall Street on Friday.\n\nJapanese tech conglomerate SoftBank was down more than 8pc overnight, less than a week after it was announced as a key investor in US President Donald Trump\u2019s new $500bn (\u00a3401bn) venture to build infrastructure for artificial intelligence in the United States.\n\nDeepSeek was developed by a start-up based in the eastern Chinese city of Hangzhou, known for its high density of tech firms.\n\nAvailable as an app or on desktop, it can do many of the things that its Western competitors can do - write song lyrics, help work on a personal development plan, or even write a recipe for dinner based on what\u2019s in the fridge.\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen, a close advisor to Trump, described it as \u201cAI\u2019s Sputnik moment\u201d - a reference to the Soviet satellite launch that sparked the Cold War space race.\n\nScale AI\u2019s Alexandr Wang wrote on X that DeepSeek \u201cis a wake up call for America\u201d.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:15 PM GMT\n\nSigning off...\n\nThanks for joining us today on this live blog covering DeepSeek and the Wall Street tech sell-off.\n\nCurrently, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index is down 3.4pc. Nvidia is down 16.6pc.\n\nMeanwhile, the S&P 500 is down 1.9pc and Dow Jones Industrial Average, of 30 leading US companies, has regained its earlier losses. It is currently up 0.1pc.\n\nStory Continues\n\n05:55 PM GMT\n\nReaders discuss what DeepSeek means to Western tech giants\n\nTelegraph subscribers have been weighing in on the implications of DeepSeek. You can carry on the conversation in the comments.\n\n05:51 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek a \u2018double-edged sword\u2019 for tech giants, says economist\n\nUS tech giants face a \u201cdouble-edged sword\u201d from DeepSeek, and could benefit from it, an economist has said.\n\nJohn Higgins, chief markets economist at Capital Economics, said that the so-called \u201chyperscalers\u201d, the tech giants operating data centres that offer cloud computing, \u201cdon\u2019t seem to be in a rush to scale back investment in AI\u201d.\n\nHe said: \u201cMeanwhile, Stargate [a $500bn (\u00a3400bn) investment in artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure] suggests a general push in the opposite direction, ie, the need for more, not less, investment in the technology in the US.\n\n\u201cNonetheless, if it became clear that AI models could indeed be trained effectively with less high-end computing power than had previously been assumed, there would clearly be a risk of a further correction in the US stock market. That\u2019s because this would potentially undermine the dominant positions of some firms that have powered the rally.\n\n\u201cHaving said that, while such an outcome would conceivably be detrimental for the semiconductor industry, it would potentially be a double-edged sword for some hyperscalers (insofar as it lowered their capital costs, but undermined their dominance in the marketplace). And it would presumably be beneficial for users and consumers of cheaper and easier-to-access AI models.\u201d\n\n05:32 PM GMT\n\nUS sell-off hits European tech firms\n\nThe sell-off of tech firms in the US also spread to continental Europe. In the Netherlands, chip equipment giant ASML dropped 7pc to touch a two-month low and ASM International slumping more than 12pc.\n\nTwo Germany business that provide electric hardware for AI infrastructure tanked. Siemens Energy plunged 19.9pc, while Schneider Electric fell 9.6pc. They were among the weakest performers on the pan-European Stoxx 600 index.\n\nThe sell-off comes after the Stoxx 600 touched an intra-day record high on Friday and as investors await earnings from U.S. tech giants Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Tesla later this week.\n\n05:22 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek won\u2019t destroy demand for AI chips, says investment manager\n\nChipmakers have taken a pounding today on the back of reports that China\u2019s DeepSeek can deliver good AI without lots of hardware.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is down 15.7pc. The tech titan is known as the leader in GPUs, the advanced semiconductors needed to run AI applications.\n\nMeanwhile ARM has lost 10pc and AMD is down 5.8pc. Intel dropped 2.9pc.\n\nJay Hatfield, chief executive of Infrastructure Capital Advisors, said: \u201cIt\u2019s clearly not good for ChatGPT to have an aggressive competitor, but we don\u2019t buy the thesis that this is going to tank the demand for high-end GPUs.\u201d\n\n05:17 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek will unleash Chinese innovation, says tech analyst\n\nBen Thompson, whose Stratechery newsletter is widely read by tech industry leaders, said today that China is \u201ca big winner, in ways that I suspect will only become apparent over time.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cNot only does the country have access to DeepSeek, but I suspect that DeepSeek\u2019s relative success to America\u2019s leading AI labs will result in a further unleashing of Chinese innovation as they realise they can compete\u201d.\n\nHe also said that consumers could get a big win here, since the AI is \u201copen sourced\u201d.\n\n\u201cDeepSeek has provided a massive gift to nearly everyone. The biggest winners are consumers and businesses who can anticipate a future of effectively-free AI products and services,\u201d he said.\n\n04:54 PM GMT\n\nInvestors make flight to safety after Nvidia jitters\n\nThe tumble in global stocks has prompted a flight to safety, with US government bonds rising and safe-haven currencies surging.\n\nDeepSeek, which overtook rival ChatGPT to become the top-rated free application on Apple\u2019s App Store in the UK and US, says it uses lower-cost chips. This challenges a widespread bet in markets that AI will drive huge expenditure with chipmakers.\n\nOn Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1pc, the S&P 500 dropped 1.8pc, and the Nasdaq Composite slumped 3pc.\n\nNvidia, whose chips are the top choice for powering AI applications, dropped 15.5pc in line with industry peers Broadcom and Marvell Technology. The CBOE Volatility Index, known as Wall Street\u2019s \u201cfear gauge\u201d, hit its highest level since Dec 20, surging 25pc today.\n\nRobert Savage, head of markets strategy and insights at BNY, said: \u201cThe catalyst of a foreign competitor to US-led AI dominance begs other questions about trade and semiconductor chips and energy needs. The markets are unsettled, and volatility is higher after last week\u2019s strong returns.\u201d\n\nIn Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 index was little changed, but the Stoxx Europe 600 technology index fell 3pc, its biggest one-day drop since mid-October. MSCI\u2019s gauge of stocks across the globe fell 1.25pc, while the FTSE 100 was flat.\n\nUS Treasury yields tumbled to multi-week lows today, tracking steep declines in equities, as investors sought the safety of government bonds. The benchmark US 10-year yield dropped 4.546pc from 4.594pc late on Friday.\n\nThat pushed the dollar lower, with safe-haven currencies, including the \u00a0the yen and Swiss franc, as the main beneficiaries.Some investors have switched from stocks to bonds - Angela Weiss/AFP via Getty Images\n\n04:33 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek struggles under \u2018malicious attacks\u2019\n\nChinese startup DeepSeek is struggling to keep up with demand from new users this afternoon.\n\nIts website says: \u201cDue to large-scale malicious attacks on DeepSeek\u2019s services, registration may be busy. Please wait and try again. Registered users can log in normally. Thank you for your understanding and support.\u201d\n\nEarlier it was hit by outages on its website. Its status page said the company had resolved issues relating to its application programming interface and users\u2019 inability to log in to the website.\n\nThe outages on Monday coincided with its sky-rocketing popularity.Deepseek said it had been hit by \u2018large-scale malicious attacks\u2019 - Andrey Rudakov/Bloomberg\n\n04:27 PM GMT\n\nChinese breakthrough gives hope to Europe, claims academic\n\nEurope\u2019s tech startups should be encouraged by the success of DeepSeek, a Barcelona-based business school professor has said.\n\nSampsa Samila, director of an AI programme at IESE Business School, said: \u201cDeepSeek has reset expectations on the capital intensity of large language models and shows that the market is in fact rather competitive and not simply dominated by a small number of very large companies.\n\n\u201cIt also demonstrates that better thinking can beat vast amounts of money, which should give hope to AI startups in Europe, where we have plenty of human capital but do not have the tens of billions to invest in training LLMs that we see in the US.\u201d\n\n04:24 PM GMT\n\nUS stock markets starting to change behaviour, says abrdn\n\nInvestors in US stocks are starting to focus more closely on profit growth rather than valuations, a leading investment manager has said.\n\nJamie Mills O\u2019Brien, investment director at abrdn, said: \u201cJitters in the tech market reinforce our view that investors should not be confining themselves only to the so-called Manificent Seven when looking for growth...\n\n\u201cWe are also starting to see signs of a market behaving slightly differently, with earnings growth - rather than [price to earnings] multiple expansion - becoming a more important arbiter of equity returns.\n\n\u201cHistorically when you hit the peak of a hiking cycle, market focus turns to earnings growth. And that is what we are seeing again \u2013 earnings, not multiples, are driving relative performance in 2024 than they have done over the last couple of years.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cEmerging markets and China are set to deliver earnings growth over and above the US market. We think that might be significant, in particular given the valuation discrepancy we are seeing.\u201d\n\n04:15 PM GMT\n\nChinese AI could boost US tech giants, says analyst\n\nWhile Nvidia has plunged today, two of the Magnificent 7 tech stocks have actually risen.\n\nKathleen Brooks, research director at XTB, said: \u201cToday\u2019s sell off could be an overreaction. If AI can run on less advanced chips, then it opens the door to stronger growth over a shorter time frame.\n\n\u201cThis may be bad news for AI\u2019s hardware producers like Nvidia, but surely it is good news for the hyper-scalers, like Microsoft, Meta and the cloud companies? This is reflected in the performance of the Magnificent 7 at the start of this week.\u201d\n\nNvidia dropped 13.6pc, Amazon is down 1pc, Microsoft is down 3.5pc, Alphabet dropped 2.5pc, Tesla lost 1pc, Apple rose 2.6pc, Meta rose 2pc.\n\n04:10 PM GMT\n\nDeepSeek surges to top of Apple\u2019s App Store\n\nChinese AI app DeepSeek is now leading the list of most popular downloads on the iPhone\u2019s App store in the UK and the US.\n\nAmerican rival ChatGPT is currently in second place.\n\nBloomberg reported that computer scientist Kai-Fu Lee told the Asian Financial Forum in Hong Kong this month: \u201cThe US is great at research and innovation and especially breakthrough, but China is better at engineering. In this day and age, when you have limited compute power and money, you learn how to build things very efficiently.\u201dDeepSeek has shot to top of the App Store and given Wall Street a fright - Yuki Iwamura/Bloomberg\n\n03:44 PM GMT\n\nSell-off is \u2018overblown\u2019, says analyst\n\nDan Ives, a Wall Street analyst at Wedbush Securities, insists the sell-off is overblown.\n\nHe said: \u201cNo US Global 2000 [company] is going to use a Chinese start-up DeepSeek to launch their AI infrastructure and use cases.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day there is only one chip company in the world launching autonomous, robotics, and broader AI use cases and that is Nvidia.\n\n\u201cLaunching a competitive LLM model for consumer use cases is one thing ... launching broader AI infrastructure is a whole other ballgame and nothing with DeepSeek makes us believe anything different.\u201d\n\n03:40 PM GMT\n\nNothing lasts forever - is this AI\u2019s Amstrad moment?\n\nMost tech investors will be nursing their losses today. James Baxter-Derrington writes:\n\nWhile DeepSeek has disrupted what\u2019s already happening in the space, it remains to be seen if it can lead.\n\nRead on as James asks: is now the time to buy up cheap tech firms?Amstrad was once a major computer brand - Phil Coburn\n\n03:31 PM GMT\n\nAI \u2018game has changed\u2019 after DeepSeek launch, says academic\n\nProf Michael Woolridge, an AI expert at Oxford University, said DeepSeek\u2019s model challenges the notion that big US AI companies had a \u201cmoat\u201d which would be hard for other companies to crack.\n\nHe said: \u201cDeepSeek challenges that wisdom, being just as capable as the flagship US models, at a fraction of the scale.\n\n\u201cIf the claims are proved to hold up in the weeks ahead, then this will shape up to be a major challenge to the big players.\n\n\u201cAnd as a side effect, it will also make this technology massively more available than it was previously \u2013 admitting a whole range of new actors into the space (which will worry governments, who are already worried about the power that AI puts in the hands of unscrupulous actors).\n\n\u201cAnd it rather starkly demonstrates that China is very much keeping pace with the US in large-scale AI. I would want to see more evidence to support the claims, but if they do hold up, then the game just changed: scale isn\u2019t everything after all.\u201d\n\nThanks for following today\u2019s updates so far. My colleague Alex Singleton is stepping up now to keep you informed on what\u2019s happening with the AI tech sell-off.\n\n03:18 PM GMT\n\nChinese AI has sparked a $1 trillion panic \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t care about free speech\n\nHave there been human rights abuses in Xinjiang? Ask ChatGPT, the artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot, and you\u2019ll receive an unambiguous yes.\n\nPut the same question to DeepSeek, a Chinese chatbot, and the answer is very different. \u201cAllegations of human rights abuses are unfounded and politically motivated,\u201d it says.\n\nIts response is not unusual: chatbots are heavily muzzled in China, where AI companies are required to instill the \u201csocialist values\u201d of the Communist Party and are regularly tested by Beijing\u2019s censors.\n\nRead how DeepSeek is sending shockwaves through Wall Street \u2013 and the West.DeepSeek\u2019s answers to various questions about China and its policies\n\n03:09 PM GMT\n\nNvidia suffers biggest rout in stock market history over China AI threat\n\nNvidia has suffered the largest stock market rout in history at the opening bell on Wall Street.\n\nThe world\u2019s most valuable company plunged 13pc as trading began in New York today, wiping more than $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off its valuation.\n\nIt still leaves the AI chip maker\u2019s market capitalisation at $3.1 trillion (\u00a32.5 trillion) as doubts emerge about US dominance of the nascent industry.\n\nThe fall in its value today eclipsed the previous record, a 9pc drop in September that wiped out about $279bn in value, according to Bloomberg.\n\n02:47 PM GMT\n\nMicrosoft suffers $119bn blow amid China AI fears\n\nStocks linked to the boom in AI have suffered steep losses at the start of trading on Wall Street over concerns that China will disrupt America\u2019s grip on the burgeoning industry.\n\nMicrosoft, which has invested close to $14bn into ChatGPT maker OpenAI, has fallen 3.5pc, knocking more than $119bn (\u00a395bn) off its valuation.\n\nChip maker Advanced Micro Devices was down 4.8pc while Micron was down 8.9pc.\n\nDell fell 7pc and Super Micro Computer dropped 8.8pc.More than $119bn has been wiped off the value of Microsoft, led by Satya Nadella - Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg\n\n02:38 PM GMT\n\nUS stocks plunge over China\u2019s AI threat\n\nUS stock markets have plunged at their sharpest pace in five months after a China AI start-up unveiled a new chatbot which threatens to match its major global competitors at a lower cost.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index on Wall Street plummeted by 3.6pc at the opening bell\u00a0to 19,234.042 - its biggest fall since September - as DeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot triggered market turmoil.\n\nAI-focused shares in the US and Europe have suffered a $1 trillion (\u00a3799bn) rout after the China app soared to the top of the Apple Store\u2019s download charts.\n\nChip making giant Nvidia was down 13pc, wiping nearly $465bn (\u00a3371bn) off the value of the world\u2019s dominant supplier of AI hardware and software.

Otherwise, the rally has been impressively resilient against the higher long-term borrowing costs of recent weeks.\n\n\u201cAnd economic growth itself remains robust, with no sign yet of the negative data surprises that preceded the turmoil last summer.\u201d\n\n01:06 PM GMT\n\nUK stocks shielded from tech sell-off\n\nThe FTSE 100 has been insulated from the rapid sell-off in tech stocks after it hit a record high at the end of last week.\n\nBritain\u2019s flagship index was down 0.2pc to its lowest in a week but the losses were miniscule compared to the 3.9pc drop that the Nasdaq is on track to make at the opening bell.\n\nThe midcap FTSE 250 was down 0.6pc as it was dragged lower by its technology stocks, which have been hit by the rising popularity of Chinese AI app DeepSeek, which has raised questions about lofty valuations of tech giants on Wall Street.\n\nSusannah Streeter of Hargreaves Lansdown added: \u201cThe make up of the FTSE 100 also offers resilience in an uncertain world, with pharma, consumer staples, and utility stocks offering the prospect of stable returns whatever the economic weather.\u201d\n\n12:40 PM GMT\n\nWall Street fear gauge rises amid tech sell-off\n\nWall Street\u2019s so-called \u201cfear gauge\u201d has moved higher amid a sharp sell-off in tech stocks.\n\nThe Cboe Volatility Index has hit its highest level so far this year, has risen more than six points to 21.38.\n\nDavid Morrison of Trade Nation said: \u201cInvestors have been forced to reconsider the outlook for capital expenditure and valuations given the threat of discount Chinese AI models.\n\n\u201cThese appear to be as good, if not better, than US versions.\u201d\n\n12:10 PM GMT\n\nTech sell-off eases government borrowing costs\n\nTreasury borrowing costs have fallen to their lowest level since the turn of the year as the sharp sell-off in tech stocks pushed investors towards safe haven assets.\n\nThe yield on 10-year UK gilts - a benchmark of government borrowing costs - has fall seven basis points today to 4.56pc as money moved out of tech companies and into the relative stability of sovereign-backed bonds.\n\nGovernment bonds are considered a safe haven because the returns - the yield - are guaranteed by the state. The yield falls when there is greater demand as the government does not need to promise higher returns to attract buyers for its debt.\n\nThe fall in borrowing costs has wiped out the spike in yields earlier this month which triggered doubts about Rachel Reeves\u2019s ability to meet her fiscal rules. It had threatened to wipe out her \u00a310bn of fiscal headroom, which had been described by economists as \u201crazor thin\u201d.\n\nThe yield on 10-year US Treasury bonds plunged by 11 basis points to 4.5pc, its lowest level this year.\n\nDeutsche Bank analyst Jim Reid said the drop in borrowing costs \u201cshows how crucial a handful of US stocks are to global macro\u201d.\n\nPointing to the 14pc plunge in Nvidia shares, he said: \u201cThis is a company that has gone from relative earnings obscurity to one of the most profitable in the world inside two years and the largest company in the world as of Friday night.\n\n\u201cThe problem is that the AI industry is embryonic. And it\u2019s almost impossible to know how it will develop or what competition current winners might face even if you fully believe in its potential to drive future productivity.\n\n\u201cThe stratospheric rise of DeepSeek reminds us of this.\u201dChancellor Rachel Reeves has come under pressure this year after a surge in government bond yields wiped out her fiscal headroom left in the Budget - REUTERS/Yves Herman\n\n11:47 AM GMT\n\nNvidia down 12pc in premarket trading\n\nIt is becoming harder to keep track of how fast investors are dumping risky assets linked to the boom in artificial intelligence today.\n\nNvidia, the chip maker that has become the darling of the sector, has plunged 12pc in premarket trading.\n\nOther chipmakers such as AMD and Micron Technology fell 5.3pc and 8.4pc, respectively.\n\nMicrosoft, which has backed ChatGPT maker OpenAI, is down 5.9pc\n\nAI server makers Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer slid 9.3pc and 10.9pc ahead of the opening bell in New York.Nvidia co-founder and chief executive Jensen Huang is preparing for about $400bn to be wiped off the value of his company - An Rong Xu/Bloomberg\n\n11:34 AM GMT\n\nDeepSeek pours cold water on AI \u2018scaling laws\u2019\n\nThe artificial intelligence market boom of the last two years has been built on the idea that building increasingly advanced systems will require companies such as OpenAI, Microsoft and Google to spend unprecedented sums on computer hardware such as Nvidia microchips and huge data centres.\n\n\u201cScaling laws\u201d - the idea that smarter AI will require more data and more spending - have become gospel in Silicon Valley.\n\nIt had made Nvidia the world\u2019s most valuable company and created a halo effect around companies such as ASML, whose machines make the microchips.\n\nThe arrival of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI start-up, has appeared to pour cold water on that theory.\n\nThe company claims that it cost just $5.6m to train its latest V3 model, which offers similar performance to the best OpenAI and Google AI systems.\n\nA new model released last week, R1, claims to contain so-called \u201creasoning\u201d capabilities which experts see as a step towards human-level AI.\n\nIf the techniques DeepSeek used to develop its models spread into the rest of the AI world, it could lead to a sharp slowdown in spending on Nvidia chips and other hardware, which have been the picks and shovels of the current AI gold rush.\n\nAs Mizuho\u2019s Jordan Rochester put it on Monday:\u00a0\u201cIt fundamentally breaks the AI Capex narrative if true.\u201d\n\n11:14 AM GMT\n\nTech rout deepens on Wall Street\n\nThe Nasdaq has plummeted further ahead of the opening bell on Wall Street as the DeepSeek tech rout deepens.\n\nThe tech-focused index was down more than 5pc in premarket trading, while S&P 500 \u201cfutures\u201d contracts were down 3pc.\n\nBen Barringer, technology analyst at Quilter Cheviot, said: \u201cDeepSeek\u2019s success will serve to intensify the US/China AI war, particularly following the recent announcement of the Stargate project in the US.\n\n\u201cIt also provides a wake up call and somewhat of a question mark on how much needs to be spent in order to build a model, and whether quite the level of CapEx we have been seeing is really required.\n\n\u201cHowever, bringing the price of model training down is no bad thing as it will help to lower the entry point and this price elasticity could help drive usage and volume.\u201d\n\n11:04 AM GMT\n\nTrue value of AI lies in data, says Salesforce boss\n\nChina chatbot DeepSeek is proving that the true value of AI is not in the user experience but in the data used to enhance it, the boss of US cloud software company Salesforce has said.\n\nDeepSeek said it had taken just two months and less than $6m (\u00a34.8m) to build a model more advanced than many of its Western competitors.\n\n10:43 AM GMT\n\nTech stocks on track for $1 trillion wipe-out\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s new artificial intelligence chatbot has triggered market turmoil that could wipe more than $1 trillion (\u00a3799bn) off technology companies at the opening bell in New York later.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 has tumbled 3.4pc in premarket trading, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell 2pc.\n\nIn Europe, tech stocks led market losses, with shares of chip equipment maker ASML down 11pc.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 and Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 technology companies are together on track to take a hit of more than $1 trillion to their market valuations if the losses are confirmed at the opening bell on Wall Street this afternoon.\n\n10:34 AM GMT\n\nChina\u2019s lightning AI success should frighten Wall Street \u2013 and Trump\n\nChina has astonished the artificial intelligence community with a new model that runs at the fraction of the cost of American \u201cfrontier\u201d models, writes Andrew Orlowski.\n\nDeepSeek is almost as good too and it has published the source code, so everyone can download it and run it. Not for the first time, China appears to have copied someone else\u2019s product, and can sell a much cheaper version.\n\nThe high profile venture capitalist Marc Andreessen called DeepSeek\u2019s model \u201cthe most amazing and impressive breakthrough I\u2019ve ever seen, and\u2026 a profound gift to the world\u201d.\n\nThe New York Times quoted a Californian professor and entrepreneur saying that \u201cthe center of gravity of the open source community has been moving to China\u201d, which he thought was \u201ca huge worry\u201d.\n\nRead how Western hopes of winning the next technological revolution are being dashed.Donald Trump\u2019s plans for a $500bn AI investment programme led by prominent industry figures including Sam Altman now look like a riskier bet - Andrew Harnik/Getty Images\n\n10:11 AM GMT\n\nNvidia down 10pc as DeepSeek to \u2018put the cat among the pigeons\u2019\n\nAI poster child Nvidia dropped more than 10pc in premarket trading after the launch of DeepSeek\u2019s AI Assistant.\n\nOther chipmakers such as AMD and Micron Technology fell 4.5pc and 7.4pc, respectively.\n\nAI server makers Dell Technologies and Super Micro Computer slid 7.8pc and 9.6pc ahead of the opening bell in New York.\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: \u201cIt is far too early to describe DeepSeek as an existential threat to US-based AI solutions.\n\n\u201cIt will almost certainly put the cat among the pigeons as investors scramble to assess the potential damage it could have on a burgeoning industry which has powered much of the gain seen in the main indices over the past couple of years.\u201d\n\n09:45 AM GMT\n\nMicrosoft boss dismisses fears over China AI chatbot\n\nThe boss of Microsoft appeared to play down concerns about the emergence of China AI start-up DeepSeek, which has sparked a sell-off in US tech shares.\n\nSatya Nadella said that as AI \u201cgets more efficient and accessible, we will see its use skyrocket\u201d.\n\nHe pointed to the economic theory known as Jevons paradox, which states that when technological progress improves efficiency, it actually leads to greater consumption of that resource, not less.\n\nUsers have been wowed by the roll-out of DeepSeek, a free assistant that its developers say uses lower-cost chips and less data.\n\nMicrosoft shares are down more than 4pc in premarket trading in New York amid suggestions that valuations of US tech stocks have become inflated as investors race to capitalise on the boom in AI.\n\n09:30 AM GMT\n\nDeepSeek triggers tech stock sell-off\n\nGlobal markets have been rocked by the unveiling of DeepSeek\u2019s new chatbot.\n\nThe Nasdaq 100 tumbled as much as 3.2pc in premarket trading, while contracts on the S&P 500 fell 1.9pc.\n\nIn Europe, tech stocks led market losses, with shares of chip equipment maker ASML down more than 8pc.\n\nThe pan-European Stoxx 600 was down 0.7pc.

While some analysts suggest the sell-off is an overreaction and that cheaper AI could benefit cloud companies in the long run, the immediate impact is overwhelmingly negative for companies like Apple, which are indirectly affected by the broader market downturn and investor sentiment. Apple's relatively small drop compared to others might be due to its diversified business model, but the overall negative market sentiment and uncertainty surrounding the AI landscape significantly outweigh any potential positive effects for Apple in the short term.

The overall sentiment is negative for tech stocks, but Apple's diversified business model and less direct exposure to AI competition compared to pure-play AI companies like Nvidia may help it weather the storm. Considering the mixed impact and the potential for the sell-off to be overblown, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be around 0.45, while the probability of it falling is around 0.55."

        "content": "TikTok Ban Sparks Frenzy: iPhones With The App Installed Sell For $14K On eBay, Some Listed In The Millions\n\nThe recent TikTok ban in the U.S. caused millions of people a lot of confusion and frustration. Over the weekend, TikTok was removed from Apple's App Store and Google Play because of a nationwide ban. If someone deleted the app, they couldn't download it again. This has created a booming market for iPhones with TikTok still installed, with some devices selling for thousands of dollars and others listed for millions.\n\nPhones Selling for Thousands\u2014Or More\n\niPhones with TikTok pre-installed have turned into highly sought-after items on eBay. Some sellers are asking for smaller amounts, like $200-$500, but others are asking for way more. One iPhone reportedly sold for $14,000, and another was listed for a shocking $4.9 million. In Raleigh, North Carolina, a seller posted an iPhone with TikTok for over $1 million, saying the only issue was a small scratch on the screen protector.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe Biggest Disruption To IP Since Disney \u2014 Get in now as they monetize a $2 Trillion market by building content around the most profitable Character IP in history and combining it with the Patented Technology IP of the future. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUSA Today reports that in Florida, another seller listed an iPhone 15 Pro Max \"With TikTok\" for $10,000, and over 1,800 people viewed the listing in just one day. A seller in the U.K. priced an iPhone 16 at $47,000, showing that this craze isn't just happening in the U.S.\n\nWhy The Rush?\n\nThe frenzy began on January 19, 2025, when TikTok went dark due to a law requiring ByteDance, its China-based parent company, to sell its U.S. operations. Though the app became usable again after 14 hours\u2014thanks to an executive order by President Donald Trump delaying enforcement\u2014it remained unavailable for download or updates. Users who deleted the app or got new phones found themselves out of luck.\n\nApple confirmed the app's removal from its App Store, stating, \"If you already have [TikTok] installed on your device, it will remain on your device, but it can't be redownloaded or restored if you move to a new device.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nThe Uncertain Future of TikTok\n\nTikTok's future in the U.S. is still unclear. Trump has floated the idea of a joint venture where the U.S. government would own a 50% stake in the app. He's also suggested potential buyers like Elon Musk or Oracle's Larry Ellison. Meanwhile, negotiations between ByteDance, the U.S. government, and other stakeholders are ongoing, with some experts predicting a resolution could happen within weeks.\n\nUntil then, TikTok users who still have the app installed can continue using it, though it may eventually become outdated without updates. For those who deleted the app, the only way to get it back is to shell out for one of these overpriced eBay listings.\n\nSee Also: Built on the trusted network of Fortune 500 companies, this blockchain company partners with Salesforce to uproot lengthy and expensive B2B transactions, and you can invest with just $100.\n\nUsers Desperate To Reconnect\n\nThe ban has left many TikTok fans frustrated. New York Post reports that online forums are flooded with users offering thousands of dollars for phones with the app. \"I deleted TikTok, and now I can't get it back!\" one person posted on social media, offering $5,000 for a phone with the app installed. Another shared their regret: \"I thought the ban was going to last a long time, so I deleted it, only to realize it was back hours later.\"\n\nWhile some have labeled the brief ban a political stunt, others are capitalizing on the situation. The exorbitant eBay listings highlight just how much people are willing to pay to get back on TikTok\u2014even if it's temporary. Whether the app's presence on the App Store is restored soon or not, one thing is clear: TikTok's grip on American users remains as strong as ever.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThey're saying this is the biggest breakthrough in Next-Gen Tech since the iPhone.

While this demonstrates TikTok's popularity and user frustration, it's unlikely to have a significant, lasting impact on Apple's stock price. The ban was short-lived, and the situation is presented as somewhat of a novelty. The increased demand for specific iPhones is a niche market and doesn't represent a fundamental shift in Apple's overall business or revenue streams. The news is more of a curiosity than a driver of significant financial impact for Apple. The advertisements within the article are also a distraction from the core news. Therefore, the probability of a significant stock price movement, either up or down, is relatively low."

The core business of Apple remains unaffected. The temporary nature of the situation, coupled with the fact that the issue is related to a third-party app and not Apple's products or services, suggests that the market reaction will be minimal.  Any price fluctuation would likely be short-lived and within the normal daily trading range.

Additionally, the uncertainty around TikTok's future in the U.S. could create minor volatility, but it is unlikely to have a material impact on Apple's long-term performance.

While this may seem like a positive development for Apple, it's essential to consider the broader context. The ban is a result of a geopolitical dispute, and its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be short-term and limited. The article highlights the desperation of TikTok users, which may lead to a temporary increase in iPhone sales. However, this demand is unlikely to be sustainable, and the overall impact on Apple's stock price will depend on various factors, including the resolution of the TikTok ban, the company's overall sales performance, and the competitive landscape. Given the uncertainty surrounding the situation, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling."

The company has been working on building its own AI model, Llama, and DeepSeek's breakthrough shows possible efficiency gains available to future LLMs.Source: Yahoo Finance\n\nCompanies being hit hardest on Monday, most notably Nvidia, make AI chips that power these models.\n\nLast week, DeepSeek released an AI model competitive with OpenAI\u2019s last week, putting it at the top of Apple\u2019s app store.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVDA)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nVenture capitalist Marc Andreessen wrote in a post on X Jan. 24 that DeepSeek's latest R1 model is \"one of the most amazing and impressive breakthroughs I\u2019ve ever seen.\" Apple also offers ChatGPT on its latest iPhone.\n\nThe reported cost to train one of its latest models was just $5.6 billion, far below OpenAI\u2019s more than $100 million in spending to train GPT-4 \u2014 prompting concern among the investment community that hyperscalers are severely over investing in AI infrastructure.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) and Broadcom (AVGO) led chip stocks down, while the tech heavy Nasdaq dropped 2.6%.

On one hand, the stock rose 2% on Monday, bucking the trend of other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, driven by the potential for more efficient AI models benefiting iPhone AI capabilities, as suggested by the DA Davidson analyst. The DeepSeek news is interpreted positively for Apple. However, the article also mentions that Apple stock is down 12% from last month, facing downgrades due to struggling iPhone sales, and the AI smartphone market hasn't gained traction. The upcoming earnings report on January 30th adds uncertainty. While analysts generally recommend buying the stock with a target price of $246, the recent downgrades and overall market sentiment regarding AI investment suggest caution. Considering these factors, the positive news about AI efficiency is somewhat offset by existing concerns about iPhone sales and market performance. Therefore, the probability of a further rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

While Apple's stock rose due to the positive implications of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI model (potentially enabling better AI integration in iPhones),  countervailing factors exist.  These include the overall sell-off in AI-related stocks,  recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital citing struggling iPhone sales, and the upcoming earnings report. The analyst consensus is bullish, with a target price above the current level, but the market's reaction to the DeepSeek news is not necessarily indicative of sustained growth. The positive news is specific to Apple's potential to improve its AI offerings, while the negative factors are broader market trends and company-specific concerns. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is moderately higher than the probability of a price fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely given the conflicting information."

The recent downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital further highlight these concerns. The upcoming earnings report adds further uncertainty. While the majority of analysts recommend buying, the conflicting signals \u2013 positive AI news versus weak iPhone sales and market headwinds \u2013 create ambiguity.  Considering the previous predictions, which consistently show a probability of a rise between 0.6 and 0.7, and the inherent uncertainty surrounding the near-term market reaction, a conservative estimate is warranted. The short-term positive reaction is likely to be tempered by the longer-term concerns.  The consistent upward trend in predictions across multiple rounds, however, suggests a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but neither is overwhelmingly likely. I'm weighting the positive AI news more heavily than the negative sales figures, given the potential for long-term growth in AI-driven iPhone features, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty surrounding the upcoming earnings report."

        "content": "Apple AAPL is set to report its first-quarter fiscal 2025 results on Jan. 30.\r\n\r\nFind the latest EPS estimates and surprises on Zacks Earnings Calendar.\r\n\r\nApple expects the December quarter\u2019s (first-quarter fiscal 2025) revenues to grow low to mid-single digits on a year-over-year basis. Apple\u2019s fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 net sales increased 6.1% year over year to $94.93 billion.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $124.04 billion, indicating growth of 3.73% year over year. \r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings is currently pegged at $2.36 per share, unchanged over the past 30 days. The figure indicates a 8.26% increase from the year-ago quarter.\n\nApple Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-eps-surprise | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAAPL\u2019s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the earnings surprise being 5.05%, on average.\r\n\r\nLet\u2019s see how things are shaping up prior to this announcement.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone Sales Likely to Fall in Fiscal Q1\n\nApple\u2019s fortunes are heavily reliant on the iPhone, which is by far its biggest revenue contributor. The device accounted for 48.7% of net sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, wherein sales increased 5.5% year over year to $46.22 billion. \r\n\r\niPhone sales are likely to have suffered from stiff competition in China from Chinese vendors, including Huawei and Xiaomi. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence to a major part of Apple\u2019s installed base has been a concern.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal first-quarter iPhone net sales is pegged at $69.189 billion, suggesting 0.7% year-over-year decline.\n\nAAPL\u2019s Services Growth to Remain Steady in Fiscal Q1\n\nThe weakness in iPhone sales is expected to be partially negated by the steady growth of the Services segment. An expanding paid subscriber base has been a key catalyst for the Services business, which is riding on the increasing popularity of the App Store and an expanding installed base of devices, albeit with a worsening regulatory environment.\r\n\r\nApple has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio, offering Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple Card, Apple Fitness+ and Apple One bundle. \r\n\r\nFor the Services segment, Apple expects a double-digit growth rate similar to fiscal 2024. The consensus mark for Services is currently pegged at $26.176 billion, suggesting 13.2% growth on a year-over-year basis.\n\nApple\u2019s Mac Sales to Rise Y/Y\n\nApple\u2019s Mac shipment is expected to have increased 17.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of calendar 2024, per IDC data. The iPhone maker is estimated to have shipped 7 million Macs, grabbing a market share of 10.1% compared with 8.8% in the year-ago quarter. \r\n\r\nApple\u2019s estimated shipment growth rate is the largest in IDC\u2019s vendor list, followed by ASUS and Lenovo\u2019s growth of 11.7% and 4.8%, respectively. Dell Technologies DELL and HP HPQ saw a shipment decline of 0.2% and 1.7%, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn terms of market share, Lenovo maintained the #1 position with 24.5%, trailed by HP and Dell Technologies\u2019 19.9% and 14.4%, respectively. Apple\u2019s market share improved from 8.8% in the year-ago quarter to 10.1%.\r\n\r\nIDC estimates 68.9 million sold units in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 1.8% year over year. In contrast, Gartner estimates shipment of 64.4 million units, up 1.4% year over year. In Gartner\u2019s list, ASUS gains the most in terms of shipments (up 9.8%), followed by Apple (shipments up 4.6%).\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL Shares Underperform Sector\n\nApple shares have returned 16.2%, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s return of 27.5%.\n\nApple Stock\u2019s PerformanceZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple stock is not so cheap, as the Value Score of F suggests a stretched valuation at this moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings, AAPL is trading at 28.97X, higher than the Zacks Computer & Technology sector\u2019s 27.54X.\n\nPrice/Earnings (F12M)Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL\u2019s Prospects\n\nAAPL has been on the investors' radar thanks to its AI push with the introduction of Apple Intelligence, an advanced personal intelligence system seamlessly integrated into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia.\r\n\r\nApple\u2019s AI push is expected to bring consumer-focused AI-enabled PCs into the market, thereby aiding PC shipments in the long haul. \r\n\r\nAAPL has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon, its peers in the \u201cMagnificent 7\u201d group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\nLeveraging the power of GenAI models, Apple Intelligence aims to enhance user experience across iPhone, iPad and Mac by combining robust language and image understanding with personal context. This technology, powered by Apple silicon, promises to simplify and accelerate everyday tasks while maintaining Apple\u2019s stringent privacy standards.\r\n\r\nThe Services business benefits from the growing demand for Apple TV+ content and the adoption of Apple Pay. It recently expanded Tap to Pay on iPhone to more markets, including the United Arab Emirates, Chile, Japan, Canada, Italy and Germany. Apple Pay is now available in countries like Egypt and Uruguay.\r\n\r\nThe expanding content portfolio for Apple TV+ is noteworthy.\n\nApple \u2013 China Headwind Makes the Stock a Risky Bet\n\nApple\u2019s near-term results are expected to bear the brunt of the weakness in China. A delay in the launch of Apple Intelligence is a concern, along with reported bugs. A stretched valuation is a concern.\r\n\r\nCurrently, Apple carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which implies that investors should avoid the stock right now. \r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today\u2019s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Additionally, Apple's focus on AI with Apple Intelligence could improve its competitive position in the long term.

While the company is expected to show revenue and EPS growth, driven by the Services segment and Mac sales, the anticipated decline in iPhone sales due to competition in China is a significant concern. The stretched valuation and the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further contribute to a bearish outlook. The previous round of predictions shows a slight shift towards a more negative sentiment, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling. Considering these factors, I believe the probability of the stock price falling remains higher than that of it rising."

The delayed launch of Apple Intelligence and its reported bugs add further uncertainty.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a strong negative signal, reflecting concerns about valuation and near-term performance.  While the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds, particularly the potential iPhone sales decline and the negative Zacks rating, outweigh the positives.

                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include expected revenue and EPS growth, strong Services segment growth (double-digit expected), and increasing Mac sales.  The introduction of Apple Intelligence, although delayed, offers long-term potential. However, significant headwinds exist. A decline in iPhone sales due to Chinese competition is a major concern, given the iPhone's substantial contribution to revenue. The delayed launch of Apple Intelligence and its reported bugs add further uncertainty. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is a strong negative signal, reflecting concerns about valuation and near-term performance.  The consistent prediction of a higher probability of a price fall across multiple models in previous rounds reinforces this assessment. While the AI push is a positive long-term factor, the near-term headwinds, particularly the potential iPhone sales decline and the negative Zacks rating, outweigh the positives. Considering the weight of negative factors and the consensus of previous predictions, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple prediction rounds further strengthens the likelihood of a price decline."

The mention itself is brief and part of a broader discussion.  The 'Sell' rating is a factor suggesting potential downward pressure, but it's not a new development and is already reflected in the current market price.  Therefore, the probability of a price movement significantly influenced by this news alone is low.  The probabilities are weighted more towards the existing market trends and overall economic factors rather than this specific podcast mention."

                    "reasoning": "The financial news and previous predictions consistently highlight a bearish sentiment for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Key factors such as a year-to-date decline of 11.3%, a high forward P/E ratio of 30.1, and a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) contribute to a cautious outlook. Although Apple is a Magnificent 7 stock and backed by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, these points of support are outweighed by the negative indicators. The neutral to slightly negative tone of the news and the lack of new positive catalysts reinforce the expectation of further price decline."

        "headline": "Tesla, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Apple are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL \u2013 January 27, 2025 \u2013 Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week\u2019s list Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META and Apple AAPL.\n\nMag 7 Earnings on Deck: A Closer Look\n\nThis week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platforms on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy.\n\nThe bounce in Tesla shares has more than made up for the market's disappointment with the Robo taxi announcement. Apple is the Mag 7 laggard this year.\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla's competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday's quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company's heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn't restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company's search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nAs we all know by now, the group's phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into 'regular/normal' growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index's total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector's market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index's total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

While overall earnings season data is positive, Apple is specifically highlighted as a laggard within the Magnificent 7, having lost 15% of its value since its 52-week high. Concerns about China and its AI strategy are weighing on the stock. Analysts are projecting potentially lowered guidance. However, the article also mentions that some bulls believe the negative sentiment is overdone and anticipate an AI partnership announcement soon, potentially with Baidu. The conflicting information makes it difficult to predict the stock's movement with high certainty. The negative sentiment and potential guidance cut suggest a higher probability of a price fall, but the potential AI partnership provides some upside potential. Given the recent negative trend and analyst concerns, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall."

While the overall Q4 earnings season is showing strong results, Apple's stock has underperformed recently due to concerns about its China market performance and AI strategy.  Bearish analysts predict a guidance cut, and EPS estimates for fiscal year 2025 have been revised downward. However, bullish analysts believe the negative sentiment is overdone and point to potential partnerships in the Chinese AI market as a positive catalyst. The uncertainty surrounding these conflicting viewpoints makes it difficult to definitively predict price movement.  The probability of a price rise is slightly lower due to the negative factors mentioned, but the potential for a positive surprise from a strong earnings report or AI partnership announcement keeps the probability of a fall from being significantly higher."

Apple's stock has recently struggled, losing about 15% of its value since reaching a 52-week high around Christmas due to persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. Some analysts are projecting a potential guidance cut, which adds to the bearish sentiment. However, Apple bulls see this downbeat sentiment as overdone and expect the company to announce a local AI partner soon, which could positively impact the stock price. Given these mixed sentiments, the probability of a stock price rise seems moderate, while the probability of a fall remains significant due to ongoing concerns and earnings estimate cuts. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, I estimate the probabilities as follows."

        "content": "The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have roared higher on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet (GOOG,\u00a0GOOGL), Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close on Jan. 29. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month. \r\n\r\nThe fourth-quarter earnings of the \u201cMag 7\u201d companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits for the \u201cMag 7\u201d are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023 (read: Can \"Magnificent Seven\" ETFs Retain Their Glory in 2025?).\n\nStay up-to-date with all quarterly releases:See Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a couple of cents over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 24%.\r\n\r\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Trump's administration for a number of reasons. Tesla has the scale and scope that is unmatched in the EV industry and this dynamic could give the EV maker a clear competitive advantage in a non-EV subsidy environment. Additionally, the potential for higher China tariffs would likely keep cheaper Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD and Nio (NIO) from flooding the U.S. market in the coming years. Trump\u2019s administration will also help expedite regulatory approval of the company's autonomous driving technology. \r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit as the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump, last week, rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on shares. Tesla shares fell 12% in a month (read: Tesla Slips on Q4 Delivery Miss: ETFs in Focus).\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.43% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Microsoft saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Its earnings track record is impressive, with the fourth-quarter earnings surprise being 4.91%, on average. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates earnings growth of 6.8% and revenue growth of 10.8% from the year-ago quarter. Microsoft has gained about 4% over the past three months, underperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.8%.\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home. Though Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the next quarter.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 12% over the past three months, slightly ahead of the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%. \r\n\r\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from 680 to 700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to 710 from 660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from the $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4. Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has underperformed the industry, having shed 4.6% over the past three months.\r\n\r\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has risen 20% in the last three months, outperforming the industry\u2019s average growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.48% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% for the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 20% in the past three months, higher than the industry\u2019s growth of 11.7%.\r\n\r\nAmazon soared to new all-time highs last week, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nStory Continues\n\nETFs to Tap\n\nGiven this, investors may want to invest in these stocks through ETFs.

The positive aspects include: 1) Apple is one of the Magnificent Seven stocks, which often receive significant investor attention. 2) Apple is reporting earnings this week, which could be a catalyst for a price increase if the results are positive. 3) Pfizer gains after activist investor forgoes board nominations, which could indicate a positive trend in the market.

The dominant negative sentiment stems from the broader tech sector downturn fueled by DeepSeek AI's new model and the anticipation of a potential interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve. These factors create considerable market uncertainty and downward pressure on tech stocks, including Apple. While Apple's upcoming earnings report offers the potential for a positive catalyst, the prevailing negative sentiment and the lack of concrete positive news make a price rise less likely in the immediate aftermath of this news. The consistent bearish predictions across multiple models in previous rounds further reinforce this negative outlook.  The consensus leans heavily towards a fall, and while a positive earnings surprise is possible, the probability of a price rise remains low given the current market conditions and overall negative sentiment."

(AAPL) due to several factors: 1) Concerns over the new AI model from China's DeepSeek, which has negatively impacted tech sector stock futures. 2) The upcoming earnings reports from major tech companies, including Apple, which introduce uncertainty. 3) The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting, which could influence market conditions with potential interest rate adjustments. While Apple's strong fundamentals and potential positive earnings could provide some support, the overall market sentiment and sector-specific concerns suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term. Previous predictions across various models consistently show a bearish sentiment, with probabilities ranging from 0.25 to 0.4 for a stock price rise and from 0.6 to 0.75 for a stock price fall. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is estimated to be higher than a rise."

Apple is part of the Magnificent Seven group set to report earnings this week, which could introduce volatility. The Federal Reserve's upcoming policy meeting adds further uncertainty, potentially impacting tech stocks negatively if interest rate decisions are unfavorable. Considering the overall negative market sentiment, the emergence of a new AI model, and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the Fed meeting, the probability of the stock price falling seems higher than rising. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and the potential for positive earnings reports suggest that the probability of a price rise is not negligible.

        "content": "The upcoming report from Apple (AAPL) is expected to reveal quarterly earnings of $2.36 per share, indicating an increase of 8.3% compared to the year-ago period. Analysts forecast revenues of $124.04 billion, representing an increase of 3.7% year over year.\n\nThe current level reflects a downward revision of 1.1% in the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter over the past 30 days. This demonstrates how the analysts covering the stock have collectively reappraised their initial projections over this period.\n\nBefore a company announces its earnings, it is essential to take into account any changes made to earnings estimates. This is a valuable factor in predicting the potential reactions of investors toward the stock. Empirical research has consistently shown a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and the short-term price performance of a stock.\n\nWhile investors usually depend on consensus earnings and revenue estimates to assess the business performance for the quarter, delving into analysts' forecasts for certain key metrics often provides a more comprehensive understanding.\n\nGiven this perspective, it's time to examine the average forecasts of specific Apple metrics that are routinely monitored and predicted by Wall Street analysts.\n\nAccording to the collective judgment of analysts, 'Net Sales- Products' should come in at $97.64 billion.

The estimate suggests a change of +13.2% year over year.\n\nThe average prediction of analysts places 'Revenue- Mac' at $8.33 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +7% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe collective assessment of analysts points to an estimated 'Revenue- iPhone' of $69.19 billion. The estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -0.7%.\n\nBased on the collective assessment of analysts, 'Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories' should arrive at $12.55 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus among analysts is that 'Revenue- iPad' will reach $7.39 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +5.2% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe combined assessment of analysts suggests that 'Geographic Revenue- Greater China' will likely reach $22.16 billion. The estimate indicates a change of +6.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nThe consensus estimate for 'Geographic Revenue- Europe' stands at $31.05 billion. The estimate points to a change of +2.2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIt is projected by analysts that the 'Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific' will reach $9.91 billion. The estimate indicates a change of -2.5% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nAnalysts predict that the 'Geographic Revenue- Japan' will reach $7.71 billion. The estimate suggests a change of -0.8% year over year.\n\nAnalysts forecast 'Geographic Revenue- Americas' to reach $52.23 billion. The estimate points to a change of +3.6% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nAnalysts expect 'Gross margin- Services' to come in at $19.36 billion. Compared to the present estimate, the company reported $16.84 billion in the same quarter last year.\r\n\r\nView all Key Company Metrics for Apple here>>>\r\n\r\nOver the past month, shares of Apple have returned -12.8% versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +1.1% change.

The downward revision of EPS estimates over the past 30 days (-1.1%) is a significant negative indicator, suggesting analyst pessimism.  Furthermore, the projected -0.7% year-over-year decline in iPhone revenue, a major driver of Apple's performance, is concerning. Although other segments show growth, the overall picture is less optimistic than initially anticipated.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further reinforces the negative sentiment.  While some segments like Services show strong growth, the overall picture is tempered by the iPhone revenue decline and the downward revision of EPS estimates.

The consistent positive predictions from various AI models across multiple rounds further reinforce the likelihood of a positive market reaction. While there's always market uncertainty, the substantial improvements to the App Store ecosystem and the clear indication of strong customer adoption significantly outweigh any potential negative factors. The increasing probability of a price rise in subsequent prediction rounds also supports this conclusion.

        "content": "Monday's swift sell-off in the markets serves as a reminder for not only what's been the driving force of the bull market thus far, but also what investors have been expecting to come in 2025. It's all about big tech earnings.\n\nNew developments from Chinese artificial intelligence DeepSeek sparked the rout as investor concerns over brewing competition in the AI space for Nvidia (NVDA) and other big tech names prompted pause in the US AI trade.\n\nNvidia stock was set to open lower by more than 11%. Meanwhile fellow \"Magnificent Seven\" members Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL,GOOG), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) were all off about 5% or more in pre-market trading. Broadcom (AVGO), another large player in the AI space, was down more than 12%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ES=F)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nA slowdown in Big tech's rapid earnings growth has been a risk to the market that strategists have been talking about for more than a year. With with index valuations near multi-decade highs and the 10 largest stocks comprising nearly 40% of the S&P 500, strategists have argued the rapid rally in stocks is increasingly on thin ice.\n\nBut unlike other risks like higher interest rates or sticky inflation, there hasn't been a clear story for why the exceptional Big Tech earnings growth story would collapse. For now, this weekend's DeepSeek AI model launch appears to be a tangible reason for investors to question whether the high earnings expectations will truly follow through.\n\nIn 2024, Magnificent Seven earnings outperformed the rest of the S&P 500 index by 30 percentage points, per research from Goldman Sachs. And while that margin is expected to slow in the year ahead, causing some to call for a broadening out of stock market returns, big tech earnings growth remains a key pillar of the bull market thesis.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. The year-over-year growth rate for the \"Magnificent Seven\" is expected to slow in the first quarter, before accelerating once more to year-over-year earnings growth of more than 24% in the third quarter.\n\nAs Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"NEW YORK, NEW YORK - JANUARY 22: Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during morning trading on January 22, 2025 in New York City. Stocks continued an upward swing opening up high a day after the Dow Jones closed up 500 points and the S&P 500 approaching an all-time high. The rise comes after OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son and Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison made an announcement alongside President Donald Trump that they will create a new company, called Stargate, to grow artificial intelligence infrastructure in the U.S. (Photo by Michael M.

While the article focuses on the broader 'Magnificent Seven' and their significant contribution to S&P 500 earnings, it doesn't directly mention Apple's specific exposure to the DeepSeek competition or any immediate negative impact on Apple's business. However, the general market sentiment is negative, and the article suggests a potential slowdown in Big Tech earnings growth, which could indirectly affect Apple. Given Apple's size and influence, a general market downturn often impacts its stock price. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' are expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks. This suggests that the 'Magnificent Seven' are still expected to grow earnings, but at a slower pace than before. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to the overall negative market sentiment and potential for slower growth, but not a drastic fall since Apple's specific situation isn't directly addressed as severely impacted."

A slowdown in this growth, as suggested by the DeepSeek event and the market reaction, would negatively impact Apple's stock price.  The article highlights the significant weight of the 'Magnificent Seven' in the S&P 500, implying that their performance heavily influences the overall market.  Therefore, the negative sentiment surrounding the AI sector and the broader tech market increases the likelihood of a negative impact on Apple's stock price. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product portfolio might offer some resilience.  The probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise, but it's not a certainty given Apple's inherent strength."

        "headline": "Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals",
        "content": "Meta Wants To Leverage TikTok Ban Threat to Promote Instagram On Other Social Media, Offers Cash Deals\n\nMeta\u00a0Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is trying to promoteInstagram by exploiting the absence of the Chinese rival TikTok download option from Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google stores.\n\nIn 2020, President Donald Trump threatened to ban TikTok, citing national security threats due to its ownership by ByteDance Ltd. However, recently, Trump urged the Supreme Court to delay the TikTok ban after assuming charge as the new President on January 20.\n\nAlso Read: BYD, Geely, SAIC Contest EU\u2019s High EV Tariffs In Court\n\nPreviously, the Biden administration ordered ByteDance to divest its ownership of TikTok or face an effective ban on the app in the U.S. on January 19.\n\nTikTok, has 170 million U.S. users and accounts for ~4% of the U.S. digital ad market. Around 63% of teens aged 13 to 17 use TikTok compared to 59% who use Instagram, CNBC cites a 2023\u00a0Pew Research Center survey.\n\nThe Facebook and Instagram parent encouraged creators to promote Instagram on other short-form video apps, like TikTok, Snap Inc (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat, and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube including three months of posting exclusivity by doling out attractive offers, CNBC cites from a creator contract details.\n\nMeta\u2019s monthly cash bonuses ranged from $10,000 to $50,000 to shift their videos to Instagram Reels, CNBC cites the Information. The deals last six months and obligate a creator to post a minimum of eight Instagram Reels per month.\n\nMeta paid over $2 billion to content creators\u00a0in 2024. Four million content creators have reportedly made money from the platform since 2017.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies, includingOracle Corp (NYSE:ORCL) co-founder and Chairman\u00a0Larry Ellison and Elon Musk, emerged as eligible contenders for\u00a0TikTok after Trump suspended the TikTok ban for 75 days.\n\nMETA Stock Prediction For 2025\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Meta Platforms, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Meta Platforms, the 200-day moving average sits at $536.57, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $647.49. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to Meta through iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSE:IYW) and Global X Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF (NASDAQ:AIQ).\n\nPrice Action: META stock is down 1.57% at $637.71 premarket at the last check on Monday.\n\nAlso Read:\n\nQualcomm Gains $2 Billion Boost From Samsung S25 Chipset Deal, Analyst Highlights Growth in Handsets and Beyond\n\nImage via Shutterstock\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

However, the focus is on Meta and its competitive positioning rather than any direct negative impact on Apple. Given that Apple is a strong company with a solid market position, the news does not suggest any immediate threat to its stock price. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is estimated to be higher than that of it falling, but the overall impact is likely to be minimal. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability of rise and a lower probability of fall."

On one hand, Meta's attempt to capitalize on a potential TikTok ban could indirectly benefit Apple by increasing Instagram usage, as Instagram is available on the Apple App Store. However, the news primarily focuses on Meta's strategy and doesn't directly impact Apple's core business or revenue streams. The article also mentions potential delays or reversals of the TikTok ban, which would negate any potential benefit to Instagram and, by extension, Apple. Given the indirect and uncertain nature of the impact, the probability of a significant stock price movement for Apple is relatively low. The current premarket price action of META being down suggests a slightly negative sentiment in the market, which could indirectly affect AAPL as well. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price fall."

(AAPL) as it is more focused on the social media and advertising strategies of Meta. The potential TikTok ban could indirectly affect Apple if it impacts the overall social media and advertising landscape, but there is no direct correlation mentioned in the news.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Street. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks making waves on Wall Street.\n\nThe moment of reckoning has arrived: China\u2019s artificial intelligence industry has almost caught up with the US. Moreover, it is more open and efficient too. This is unlike the US\u2019s strategy towards the nascent technology, which it wants to keep largely within its borders. To recap President Donald Trump\u2019s first week in office, it is safe to say that the message towards the community has been simple: Build, build, and build.\n\nWhen he came to office, Trump immediately rescinded Biden\u2019s sweeping executive order on AI. While AI with fewer guardrails may be terrifying for some, it may be a possible way to expand into new territories and win the race toward AI. In light of this, Trump has recently signed an executive order related to AI to \u201cmake America the world capital in artificial intelligence\u201d.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 Trending AI Stocks on Wall Street and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nThe President has also announced a joint venture led by SoftBank Group Corp., OpenAI, and Oracle Corp. The \u201cStargate initiative\u201d will fund billions of dollars worth of AI infrastructure. On the eve of taking office, President Trump said that he would allow \u201cpeople with a lot of money\u201d to invest in so-called \u201cAI plants\u201d that power data centers for artificial intelligence.\n\nTrump\u2019s actions signal the direction AI policy is going to take under his reign, particularly when it comes to competing with China. Meanwhile, both China and the US are doing everything in their power to win the AI race. Back in September, OpenAI released the world\u2019s first reasoning model, o1, which used a \u201cchain of thought\u201d to answer difficult questions. Other companies soon followed suit. Google developed its own reasoning model called \u201cGemini Flash Thinking\u201d in December and a few days later, o3 was born.\n\nKeeping a close tab on these developments, China has recently made a mark of its own, igniting panic in Silicon Valley along the way. An AI lab, known as DeepSeek, unveiled a free, open-source large-language model in late December. According to the lab, it took only two months and less than $6 million to build the model, using reduced-capability chips from Nvidia called H800s.\n\nThird-party benchmark tests have revealed how DeepSeek\u2019s model outperformed Meta\u2019s Llama 3.1, OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o, and Anthropic\u2019s Claude Sonnet 3.5 in accuracy ranging from complex problem-solving to math and coding. If this wasn\u2019t enough, DeepSeek, last Monday, released r1, a reasoning model that has outperformed OpenAI\u2019s latest o1 in several of these third-party tests.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cTo see the DeepSeek new model, it\u2019s super impressive in terms of both how they have really effectively done an open-source model that does this inference-time compute, and is super-compute efficient. We should take the developments out of China very, very seriously\u201d.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s r1 is particularly remarkable considering it also had to navigate the strict semiconductor restrictions that the U.S. government has imposed on China. These restrictions had cut the country off from access to the most powerful chips, like Nvidia\u2019s H100s. The development also implies how the AI lab either found a way around the rules or, the controls were simply not as effective as anticipated. Does this mean that Trump\u2019s stance toward fewer guardrails is the way to go? We are yet to find out.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Strengthening AI Leadership with Apple Intelligence\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm by launching Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. On January 24, BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan lowered the firm\u2019s price target on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to $253 from $256 and kept a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the shares. The rating has been issued ahead of the company reporting fiscal Q1 results. The company will report its results after market close on Thursday, January 30. Even though the firm expects a \u201cstrong report\u201d from Apple due to the iPhone 16\u2019s initial demand, it has also lowered its fiscal Q2 iPhone units estimate to 49M from 56M. The analyst cited two reasons for the lowered outlook: a weak macro environment and the prolonged rollout of generative artificial intelligence features. The firm further said investors already know about the weak iPhone sales, reiterating a Buy rating based on Apple\u2019s strong profit margins, future improvements, and robust cash flow.\n\n\u201cPartly due to the weak macro and partly due to the staggered launch of Apple Intelligence features,\u00a0which we\u00a0see as yet to gain widespread adoption, we lower our F2Q (March\u00a0quarter) iPhone units estimate to 49 million (from 56 million),\u201d Mohan wrote.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks making waves on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "headline": "Should You Buy Berkshire Hathaway Stock Before Jan. 30?",
        "content": "To say that Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) has been a big winner for investors over the long term would be an understatement. Between 1964 and 2023, Berkshire's overall gain was a jaw-dropping 4,384,748% -- more than 140 times greater than the S&P 500's gain during the period. Berkshire has also outperformed the S&P 500 since the end of 2023.\n\nThere could be a reason to invest in the conglomerate led by Warren Buffett sooner rather than later. The question is: Should you buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Jan. 30?\n\nWhat's special about Jan. 30?\n\nYou might be wondering what's special about that date. No, Berkshire Hathaway isn't scheduled to report its latest quarterly results then. The company's next quarterly update will probably come in late February. Neither has Berkshire announced any other special event for this week.\n\nHowever, another company will report its results for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 on Jan. 30 -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And it could be one of Apple's more important updates in quite a while. Investors will be especially interested in learning how Apple Intelligence, the bundle of new generative AI features available with iOS 18, affected iPhone sales.\n\nWhy does Apple's quarterly update matter to Berkshire Hathaway? Even though Buffett has reduced his company's stake in the consumer technology giant in recent quarters, Apple remains by far the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. Berkshire is the sixth largest institutional shareholder, owning around 2% of Apple.\n\nWhat history shows\n\nBerkshire's position in Apple currently makes up roughly 6.7% of the conglomerate's market cap. That's a significant enough level that Apple's performance matters to Berkshire. But just how much does it matter?\n\nOver the past five years, the correlation coefficient between Apple's and Berkshire's stock performances using monthly returns is 0.49. That's a moderate correlation; 1.0 is very strong.\n\nCould Berkshire Hathaway's share price jump if Apple reports exceptionally great results later this week, though? Maybe. However, if history is any guide, don't count on it.\n\nFor example, Apple blew past Wall Street's expectations with its fiscal 2020 third-quarter results, reported on July 30, 2020. The company also announced a 4-for-1 stock split that excited investors. Apple stock promptly soared 10.5% the next day. Berkshire Hathaway's share price increased by less than 1%, a ho-hum move despite Apple's great quarterly update.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Jan. 27, 2022, Apple again posted terrific results. Apple CEO Tim Cook's comments about increased investment in augmented reality also captured investors' attention. Apple stock jumped 7% the following day. What about Berkshire Hathaway? Its shares also rose, but by a much less impressive 1.7%.\n\nBuy Berkshire Hathaway stock?\n\nSo should you scramble to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock before Apple reports its results on Jan. 30? Probably not. The better question, in my view, is: Should you buy Berkshire stock regardless of what happens with Apple?\n\nThere's a reasonably solid argument that you shouldn't buy Berkshire. Even Buffett doesn't seem to think his own stock is a great pick right now. After six straight years of stock buybacks, Berkshire didn't repurchase any of its shares in the third quarter of 2024.\n\nThat appears to be a clear sign Buffett doesn't view the valuation of the company he runs as attractive. Indeed, Berkshire trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.6. That's more expensive than the stock has been in a while.\n\nAnalysts aren't predicting exceptional growth for Berkshire Hathaway anytime soon, either. The consensus Wall Street estimate is that the conglomerate's revenue will increase by less than 1% in 2025, with earnings per share rising by roughly 2%.\n\nDespite these concerns, though, I still think Berkshire Hathaway is a good stock for investors to own over the long term. Its businesses generate reliable cash flow. Berkshire offers almost ETF-like diversification, with its subsidiaries and equity holdings spanning a wide range of industries. The company also has a massive cash stockpile that it can put to good use when stocks are valued more attractively.\n\nI don't think there's any reason to rush to invest in Berkshire. But it's still a stock to keep on your radar.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Berkshire Hathaway wasn\u2019t one of them.

While Apple's earnings report on January 30th is mentioned, the article suggests that Berkshire Hathaway's stock price is unlikely to be significantly affected by Apple's results. Historical data shows a moderate correlation between the two stocks, but past instances of strong Apple earnings have not led to substantial gains for Berkshire. The article also points out that Berkshire's valuation is currently high, and analysts are not predicting significant growth. Furthermore, Berkshire's lack of recent stock buybacks suggests that even Warren Buffett may not see the stock as particularly attractive at the moment. Therefore, the news is slightly negative for Berkshire Hathaway.

The article also highlights concerns about Berkshire's high valuation, lack of recent buybacks, and modest growth projections.  Therefore, the probability of Berkshire Hathaway's stock price significantly rising or falling due to Apple's earnings is low.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the consensus leans towards a low probability of significant movement in either direction for Berkshire Hathaway. The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the consensus from previous predictions, leaning slightly towards a higher probability of no significant change or a slight decrease.  The analysis focuses on Berkshire Hathaway, not Apple. The probability of Apple's stock price moving is not directly addressed in the provided news."

        "headline": "Meet the Stock Warren Buffett Has the Utmost Confidence In -- He's Been a Buyer for 24 of the Last 25 Quarters",
        "content": "When Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett speaks, investors wisely pay attention. That's because the appropriately dubbed \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen a cumulative return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of more than 5,570,000% spanning six decades.\n\nBuffett's keys to success are no secret. Whether it's in his annual letter to shareholders or during the question-and-answer session at Berkshire's annual meeting, he lays out his game plan to for building wealth on Wall Street and keeping emotions in check. Berkshire's chief is a value-oriented, long-term investor who primarily focuses on businesses with sustainable competitive advantages and strong management teams.\n\nBut when overseeing a 44-stock, $296 billion investment portfolio, it can be tough to tell which, if any, stocks the Oracle of Omaha has the most confidence in.Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple, AmEx, and Bank of America are large holdings -- but none are Buffett's favorite stock\n\nLogic would dictate that the three largest holdings by market value in Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio are the company's Warren Buffett has the utmost confidence in... but this isn't necessarily the case.\n\nTech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has consistently been Berkshire's top holding for years, and remains a company Buffett speaks highly about. Aside from the iPhone being the market share-leading smartphone in the U.S., Apple's capital-return program is world-leading. More than $725 billion worth of the company's stock has been repurchased since the start of 2013, which has demonstrably improved its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nHowever, Buffett and his top advisors, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, have also overseen the sale of more than 615 million shares of Apple stock between Oct. 1, 2023 and Sept. 30, 2024. Even if this selling is purely for tax purposes, it likely rules out Apple as the stock Buffett has the most confidence in.\n\nCredit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP) has worked its way up to No. 2 spot in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. \"AmEx,\" as American Express is more commonly known, was labeled an \"indefinite\" holding in Buffett's letter to shareholders last year. Berkshire's investment team likely appreciate AmEx's ability to play both sides of the transaction counter, with the company generating payment processing fees from merchants, as well as annual fees and interest income from cardholders.\n\nYet it's been a long time since Buffett purchased shares of American Express. If this were truly Buffett's favorite company, he would likely add to the position.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's third-largest holding, Bank of America(NYSE: BAC), is a similar story to Apple. It's a company whose management team has received praise in the past from Buffett. BofA is the most interest-sensitive of America's money-center banks and it benefited immensely from the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hiking cycle from March 2022 through July 2023.\n\nBut since July 17, 2024, required Form 4 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) show that Berkshire's top investment minds (led by Buffett) have sold 26% (about 266.5 million shares) of their Bank of America stake.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha has purchased this stock in 24 out of the last 25 quarters\n\nInterestingly enough, the stock Warren Buffett appears to have the utmost confidence in is a company that doesn't show up in Berkshire's quarterly filed Form 13Fs with the SEC. This is the form investors use to track the purchase and selling activity at Buffett's company.\n\nRather, detailed purchasing activity of this \"favorite stock\" can be found in Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results. On the page prior to the beginning of the executive certifications, investors will find a breakdown of how many shares of Berkshire Hathaway Class A and B (BRK.B) stock the Oracle of Omaha purchased during the quarter. Perhaps it's fitting that the stock Buffett buys most and has the utmost confidence in is shares of his own company.\n\nHowever, buying shares of Berkshire Hathaway stock hasn't always been easy for Warren Buffett. Prior to July 2018, shares could only be repurchased if Berkshire's stock fell to or below 120% of book value. Unfortunately (for Buffett), this is a threshold Berkshire Hathaway's stock never dipped to or below, which led to no buyback activity.\n\nOn July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked the rules governing buybacks to give its CEO more freedom to buy shares of the company he's clearly the most confident in. Under the new criteria, share repurchases have no end date or cap as long as Berkshire has at least $30 billion in combined cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries, and Buffett views his company's stock as intrinsically cheap. This last part is intentionally vague and allows Buffett to deploy his company's capital toward buybacks as he sees fit.\n\nEven though Buffett didn't repurchase shares of his company's stock in the September-ended quarter, he had done so in each of the previous 24 quarters, with a cumulative $78 billion spent on buybacks.\n\nAside from these repurchases reinforcing Buffett's belief that Berkshire Hathaway is ideally positioned to take advantage of lengthy periods of economic expansion, these buybacks serve two additional purposes.\n\nFor one, steadily reducing the company's outstanding share count is incrementally increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's investors. This goes a long way to incentivizing the long-term ethos that Buffett's late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, helped to instill.\n\nThe other purpose behind these buybacks is to make Berkshire's stock more fundamentally attractive. Companies with steady or growing net income and a declining outstanding share count can expect their EPS to increase over time.\n\nWith Berkshire Hathaway closing out the third quarter with a record $325.2 billion in (combined) cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasuries on its balance sheet, it seems only logical to expect Buffett to buy shares of the stock nearest and dearest to his heart in 2025.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The article's primary focus is on Buffett's consistent buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway stock, indicating his strong belief in its long-term value. Therefore, the news is more relevant to Berkshire Hathaway than Apple. However, the 'Double Down' advertisement mentions Apple's past performance, which could have a slightly positive, albeit indirect, impact on investor sentiment towards Apple.

This suggests that AI is becoming an increasingly important topic for investors and analysts evaluating these companies. While the headline itself doesn't reveal whether Apple's AI narrative is positive or negative, the fact that it's being discussed alongside companies like Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon, which are generally perceived as leaders in AI, suggests a potentially positive association. However, without knowing the specifics of Apple's AI narrative, it's difficult to make a definitive prediction. A neutral to slightly positive reaction is anticipated, as the market is generally receptive to AI-related news, but the lack of concrete details limits the potential upside. The risk of a negative reaction is relatively low unless Apple's AI strategy is perceived as weak or lagging behind competitors."

Most models initially cluster around 0.55-0.6, rising to 0.58-0.73 in later rounds. This upward trend suggests a growing belief in a positive, albeit modest, impact. The absence of negative news and the generally positive sentiment surrounding AI in the tech sector contribute to a higher probability of a rise than a fall.  However, the vagueness of the news prevents a significantly higher probability of a price rise. Considering the consensus and the lack of concrete Apple-specific information, I'm estimating a probability slightly higher than the initial predictions, reflecting the cautious optimism shown by the other models.

        "content": "We recently published an article titled Jim Cramer Discusses These 18 Stocks & President Trump's $500 Billion AI Plan.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed.\n\nIn his latest appearance on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer had a lot to say about a lot of stocks. Along with stocks, he was also full of comments about the new Trump administration and how it's different from the previous one. Cramer shared, \"If you go back over the councils that were disbanded post-Charlottesville, what you would see are a lot of traditional industrialists and drug companies.\" According to him, \"These were the people that were not drawn to, by Elon Musk. Elon Musk has changed the equation\" to increase the role that technology companies and executives are playing this time around.\n\nCommenting further on Musk, Cramer shared, \"Now, by the way, there's a lot of talk now about where is Elon Musk?\" This means wondering where he is \"in terms of having people in powerful positions say, in the Defense Department.\" Cramer believes that Musk \"doesn't seem to have them\" and added, \"If Musk wants to be meaningful, I don't want a seat at the table, I want a table.\"\n\nThe CNBC host also mentioned some industries that will benefit from AI. As part of a discussion about the returns from the multiple billions of dollars that firms have invested into AI, Cramer cautioned not to \"forget healthcare.\" He believes \"Healthcare's gonna be a very big, very big part of AI. David, it's not yet. And we need that, well-meaning people who believe in the industry have to have what people who are more than just trying to figure out how to make it so there's a call center that's better.\"\n\nCramer also shared his thoughts about the breadth of market performance during the day. While markets were rising, he noted, \"Yet the S&P oscillator I follow, [inaudible] is slightly overbought, there's a lot more room.\" Cramer believes \"there's a considerable part of the market that has done nothing. Nothing for years. And that's coming on.\" He doesn't like small-cap stocks either. \"And I'm not a small cap aficionado,\" Cramer commented. He believes, \"That stuff doesn't work. People always try to chin that up. And then somebody sells a big small cap derivative.\" The host added that instead of small-cap stocks, he likes \"companies that frankly, what we, you know we didn't think all that much of the second tier tech companies that are really taking off. The semis that haven't done anything lately.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs for President Trump, Cramer believes that he needs to look at insurance costs that affect a large number of Americans. According to him:\n\n\"The President has to take a look at these issues. Because this is where the, the copay, your insurance, your group insurance, your property, casualty insurance. That's where the President's going to put it. If he wants to put a stake in the inflation. He goes after the pharmacy benefits managers.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired on January 22nd.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been a regular feature of Cramer's morning appearances this year. He believes that investors who evaluate the stock primarily through the lens of China smartphone sales are missing the broader picture. Cramer also dismissed Mark Zuckberberg's comments in Joe Rogan's podcast which claimed that innovation had stopped at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) since Tim Cook took cover. More recently, he believes that the firm will post disappointing quarter results. Here is what he said:\n\n\"I said last night it's going to miss. We sold some stock because it became too big a part of our portfolio. I think it's going lower, I think they'll miss the quarter. I think there's another two or three analysts are going to try to downgrade it ahead of time. So they can upgrade it after they report the quarter. I do think it's a longer term, the stock is up thousands of percent since every single time it gets downgraded people sell it. That's all I'm saying. That's all I'm saying.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Cramer's anticipation of analyst downgrades further contributes to a potentially negative short-term sentiment.

This creates a mixed signal.  The fact that he's selling some stock suggests a negative outlook in the short term, but his long-term view remains positive. The overall news is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, but leans slightly negative due to the immediate selling action and expectation of a missed quarter.

This negative sentiment from a well-known financial personality could influence investor behavior, leading to potential selling pressure.

He also anticipates analyst downgrades ahead of the earnings report. This negative sentiment from a well-known financial commentator could influence investor behavior, leading to potential selling pressure. The consensus among various models in previous rounds consistently favors a higher probability of the stock price falling, reinforcing this assessment. While there are historical indicators of Apple's resilience after downgrades, the immediate negative sentiment and expected disappointing results suggest a higher likelihood of a short-term price decline."

        "headline": "Not all companies are backing away from DEI in the new Trump era",
        "content": "Costco (COS) did something this past week that is unusual for a company operating in the new Trump era \u2014 successfully push back against a challenge to its diversity efforts.\n\nThe giant retailer urged its stockholders to defeat a shareholder resolution from the National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a conservative think tank, that would have forced the company to evaluate risks from its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) practices.\n\nThe measure was roundly defeated, with 98% of investors siding with the company.\n\n\"Our position on these issues is not new,\" Costco\u2019s board chairman Tony James said about the company\u2019s DEI stance during an annual shareholders meeting last Thursday.A cart wrangler gathers shopping carts outside a Costco warehouse in Sheridan, Colo. (AP Photo/David Zalubowski, File)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"We have always been purposefully nonpolitical, and a welcoming workforce has been integral to the company's culture and values since its founding,\u201d James added.\n\nAn NCPPR official said Costco won the vote by aligning with conflicted asset managers and proxy advisers that profit from DEI and ESG (environmental, social, and governance) policies.\n\n\"While we are disappointed by the result, we are also not surprised, given the forces aligned against us,\" said Stefan Padfield, NCPPR\u2019s Free Enterprise Project executive director.\n\nMany prominent companies are backing away from DEI policies as corporate diversity goals come under intensifying scrutiny in Washington, D.C. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on his first day in office that ends federal DEI programs and orders US agencies to \"combat illegal private sector DEI actions.\"\n\n\u201cMy administration has taken action to abolish all discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion nonsense,\u201d Trump told business leaders and politicians last Thursday during a virtual address to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.People follow a virtual speech of U.S. president Donald Trump at the Annual Meeting of World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver the past year, a number of high-profile companies have done about-faces on diversity, including Meta (META), Walmart (WMT), McDonald's (MCD), Lowe\u2019s (LOW), Ford (F), Tractor Supply (TSCO), and John Deere (DE). The latest reversal came Friday when retailer Target (TGT) said it would end its three-year diversity, equity, and inclusion goals.\n\nMany of these retreats were also influenced by a recent US Supreme Court decision on affirmative action at colleges and universities, a ruling that prompted some conservative groups to ramp up their efforts to eliminate diverse hiring practices.\n\nBut Costco is not the only company defending its diversity stance. Another is Apple (AAPL), which has also asked investors to vote down a shareholder proposal from the NCPPR encouraging the iPhone maker to assess risks of its DEI programs. That vote will take place next month.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Apple is an equal opportunity employer and does not discriminate in recruiting, hiring, training, or promoting on any basis protected by law,\" the company said in its proxy statement.\n\nSome big banks are also holding firm, for now. The CEOs of JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Goldman Sachs (GS) this past week also said they will focus on efforts to promote DEI even as those banks are emerging as targets of activist groups pushing them to trim their DEI efforts, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nTexas Attorney General Ken Paxton and nine other Republican-controlled states sent a letter to JPMorgan, Goldman, and other big Wall Street firms asking them to respond to questions about their DEI programs, hinting at a possible legal clash to come.\n\n\"Bring them on,\" Dimon said about activist efforts targeting DEI during an interview with CNBC last week in Davos.\n\n\"We are going to continue to reach out to the Black community, the Hispanic community, the LGBT community, the veterans community.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                    "reasoning": "The news article focuses on the broader trend of companies reacting to political pressure regarding DEI initiatives. While Costco's successful defense of its DEI program is highlighted, the core of the article is about Apple's upcoming vote on a similar shareholder proposal. The article explicitly states Apple is facing a similar challenge and has asked investors to vote down the proposal. This suggests Apple is likely to follow a similar path as Costco. The market reaction to DEI news is complex and depends on investor sentiment. Some investors may view DEI initiatives positively, while others may see them as a distraction from core business objectives or as politically motivated. Given the current political climate and the trend of companies retreating from DEI, there's a slightly higher chance of a negative reaction if Apple faces significant opposition or negative press surrounding its DEI stance. However, the article also mentions that some big banks are holding firm on DEI, suggesting that there is still support for these initiatives. The fact that Apple is actively defending its DEI program suggests that they believe it is important for their business and brand. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal, with a slightly higher chance of a small decrease due to the overall negative trend surrounding DEI."

While some companies are retreating from DEI programs, Apple's steadfast stance, as evidenced by its urging investors to reject a shareholder proposal against its DEI programs, suggests a strong internal belief in the importance of these initiatives. This could be viewed positively by investors who value social responsibility and inclusive corporate cultures. However, the ongoing legal and political challenges surrounding DEI could create uncertainty and potentially impact investor sentiment.  The probability of a price rise is tempered by the overall market conditions and the potential for negative reactions from investors who oppose DEI initiatives.  The probability of a price fall is also relatively low, as Apple's strong financial performance and brand reputation are likely to outweigh the impact of this specific news."

This aligns Apple with companies like Costco, which successfully defended its DEI stance, and contrasts with others like Meta, Walmart, and Target, which have retreated from DEI commitments. The market's reaction to such news can be mixed. On one hand, maintaining DEI policies may appeal to socially conscious investors and consumers, potentially bolstering Apple's brand reputation and customer loyalty. On the other hand, political and legal challenges could introduce uncertainty. Given Apple's strong brand and historical resilience to political pressures, the positive impact on investor sentiment may outweigh the negatives.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) all report on Wednesday night, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due late Thursday.\n\nThese mega-caps will be joined by big names like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), IBM (NYSE:IBM), ASML (AS:ASML), Boeing (NYSE:BA), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS), General Motors (NYSE:GM), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Visa (NYSE:V), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX), AT&T (NYSE:T), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV).\n\nRegardless of which direction the market goes, below I highlight one stock likely to be in demand and another which could see fresh downside. Remember though, my timeframe is just for the week ahead, Monday, January 27 - Friday, January 31.\n\nStock To Buy: Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, stands out as a top buy this week, with its highly anticipated Q4 earnings report set to be a major catalyst for the tech giant.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta is scheduled to deliver its update for the fourth quarter after the U.S. market close on Wednesday at 4:05PM ET. CEO Mark Zuckerberg and CFO Susan Li are scheduled to discuss the results during a 5:00PM ET earnings call.\n\nMarket participants foresee a sizable swing in META stock after the print drops, according to the options market, with a possible implied move of 7.5% in either direction. Shares gapped down 4.3% after the last earnings report in October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nProfit estimates have been revised upward 26 times in recent weeks, according to an InvestingPro survey, with just three downward revisions, reflecting growing bullishness around Meta\u2019s earnings potential.\n\nAnalysts expect Meta to report a 26% annual jump in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to $6.73 and a 17% increase in revenue to $47 billion for the December-ended quarter. These impressive figures are driven by strong ad revenue and the company\u2019s innovative efforts to expand its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nThe company preannounced that it plans to spend between $60 billion and $65 billion on capital expenditures in 2025 to advance its strategic investments in AI, including new state-of-the-art data centers.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Meta\u2019s guidance for the current quarter will beat consensus estimates as the company reaps the benefits of its expanding user base, fresh AI initiatives, and new monetization avenues.\n\nMeta\u2019s focus on expanding its AI infrastructure has not only enhanced the effectiveness of its ad-targeting capabilities but also strengthened its product ecosystem, including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Reels, Threads, and WhatsApp.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nMETA stock hit a record peak of $652 on Friday before closing at $647.49, above the prior record high close of $636.45 from a day earlier. At current levels, the Menlo Park, California-based company has a market cap of $1.63 trillion, making it the sixth largest company trading on the U.S. stock exchange.\n\nShares have gained 10.6% to start 2025 after scoring an annual advance of 65% last year.\n\nAs InvestingPro points out, Meta boasts a great Financial Health Score of 3.4 out of 5, supported by its impressive earnings and revenue growth prospects, as well as robust gross profit margins and strong return on equity.\n\nBe sure to check out InvestingPro to stay in sync with the market trend and what it means for your trading.

A call with CEO Tim Cook and CFO Kevan Parekh is set for 5:00PM ET.\n\nThe expected move in the options market is about 4.6% up or down. Shares fell 3.1% after the company\u2019s fiscal Q4 report came out in late October.\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nUnderscoring several near-term headwinds Apple faces amid the current climate, 11 out of 17 analysts surveyed by InvestingPro lowered their revenue forecasts in the last 90 days.\n\nWhile the company is expected to post EPS of $2.35 on revenue of $124.09 billion for its most recent quarter, signs of waning iPhone demand\u2014particularly in China\u2014are raising concerns about Apple\u2019s growth trajectory.\n\nAnalysts are also worried about Apple\u2019s slower adoption and commercialization of AI, which could weigh on future product innovation.\n\nAdding to the uncertainty, Apple\u2019s guidance for the current quarter is anticipated to disappoint, with Wall Street bracing for muted sales and earnings growth.\n\nSource: Investing.com\n\nAAPL stock closed at $228.78 on Friday, not far from a recent four-month low of $219.38 touched on January 21. Shares, which are testing their 200-day moving average, are down a whopping 11% to start the new year.\n\nAt its current valuation, Apple has a market cap of $3.35 trillion, making it the second-most valuable company on the U.S. stock exchange after Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nIt is worth mentioning that despite its relative underperformance, AAPL remains extremely overvalued as per the Fair Value models on InvestingPro, which point to a potential downside of -15.5% to about $188/share.\n\nFurthermore, Apple currently has an InvestingPro Financial Health score of 2.6/5, emphasizing its slowing profit and sales growth.

        "headline": "Warren Buffett Has $69.9 Billion Invested in This Dividend-Paying Stock. Is It a Buy Now?",
        "content": "There are many ways to get rich on Wall Street, but none seem as reliable as the strategies employed by Warren Buffett. The legendary investor took control of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965. Over the past six decades, the stock has delivered a 19.6% average annual gain.\n\nThere aren't any secrets to Buffett's success. In addition to an annual shareholder meeting that can pack a stadium full of investors, Berkshire Hathaway reports its trading activity to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission every three months.\n\nWe can see from Berkshire's disclosures that it ended last September with 300 million Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares in its portfolio. Worth $69.9 billion at the time, the iPhone manufacturer made up 26% of the holding company's equity portfolio.\n\nApple is Berkshire Hathaway's largest holding, but it's a much smaller holding than it used to be. Berkshire reduced the number of Apple shares on its books by 25% in the third quarter of 2024, and it wasn't the first sale. Berkshire has reduced the size of its Apple stake by 66.5% since the end of 2022.\n\nWhy Buffett sold heaps of Apple shares\n\nBuffett wouldn't keep Apple at the top of Berkshire's portfolio if he weren't confident about the business and its ability to steadily grow earnings over time. That said, selling off more than half of its stake is hardly an inspiring vote of confidence.\n\nBerkshire's recent sales of Apple stock have more to do with the stock's stretched valuation than any concern about the business. The stock is trading for about 31.7 times trailing free cash flow. That's an appropriate price for a business with profits growing by a mid- to high-single-digit percentage, which is not an accurate description of Apple's performance in recent years.AAPL Free Cash Flow data by YCharts.\n\nTrailing-12-month revenue has risen by 1.3% over the past three years. Apple's bottom line has outpaced its top line, but not by much. Free cash flow per share has risen 10.7% over the past three years and has been creeping higher, but only because Apple is repurchasing heaps of its own stock. Total free cash flow has risen only 2.9% over the past three years.\n\nA mismatch between Apple's valuation and its recent performance puts it in a precarious situation. If the market finds a reason to get nervous about its yearslong earnings deceleration, the bottom could fall out from under the stock.\n\nWhy holding some Apple shares is still a good idea\n\nInvestors can think of free cash flow as earnings a company can use to pay dividends, reinvest, reduce debt, or repurchase stock. With $108.8 billion in free cash flow over the past 12 months, Apple can pull on a lot of different levers to keep earnings per share moving in the right direction over the long run.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's device sales aren't growing very fast, but it is selling a growing array of services to its enormous user base. Last year, the company reported more than 2.2 billion active devices worldwide, and high-margin service sales to all those device holders are picking up.\n\nFiscal fourth-quarter service sales rose 12% year over year. Now, services are responsible for 26% of total revenue.\u00a0While device sales will likely creep forward due to market saturation, plenty of those device holders haven't started subscriptions to iCloud Storage, Apple Music, or Apple TV+ yet. High-margin service sales could allow earnings to continue growing at a single-digit percentage for many years.\n\nThe bottom could fall out from under Apple's stock price the next time the stock market gets sad. Fortunately, it will take more than a bear market to slow Apple's steadily growing dividend payments. The stock offers a minuscule 0.4% dividend yield at recent prices, but it could safely raise it by leaps and bounds. Over the past 12 months, the company met its dividend commitment with just 14% of the free cash flow its operations generated.\n\nNot time to buy\n\nApple is still the largest holding in Berkshire's equity portfolio, but that doesn't make it a good stock to buy now for most investors. There are plenty of good reasons to retain some shares of Apple in a well-diversified portfolio. Unfortunately, buying the richly valued stock while sales and profits appear nearly stagnant doesn't seem like a great idea.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holds a significant stake, they have been reducing their position, citing valuation concerns. The article highlights Apple's slowing revenue growth and reliance on stock buybacks to boost free cash flow per share. However, it also acknowledges the strength of Apple's services business and its potential for future growth, as well as the safety of its dividend. The overall tone is cautious, suggesting that the stock is not a strong buy at its current valuation. The 'Double Down' advertisement is generic and doesn't specifically relate to Apple, so it is not considered in the analysis. Given the valuation concerns and slowing growth, a slight downward pressure on the stock price is more likely than a significant rise. However, the strong services business and Buffett's continued (albeit reduced) holding provide some support."

                    "reasoning": "The news article highlights Warren Buffett's significant reduction in Apple's stock holdings due to Apple's high valuation relative to its recent performance. While Apple's service revenue is growing, overall revenue and free cash flow growth are sluggish.  The article concludes that Apple's current valuation is high, making it a less attractive buy despite its strong brand and dividend.  Buffett's actions, while not a definitive indicator of future price movements, suggest a cautious outlook. The article's emphasis on the high valuation and slow growth outweighs the positive aspects of the services sector growth and dividend. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise in the short to medium term."

                    "reasoning": "The news highlights mixed signals regarding Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in Apple, which could be seen as a lack of confidence or a reaction to the stock's stretched valuation. Apple's valuation is high relative to its recent performance, with trailing free cash flow at 31.7 times and modest revenue growth of 1.3% over the past three years. This could lead to downward pressure on the stock price. On the other hand, Apple's strong free cash flow ($108.8 billion over the past 12 months) and growing high-margin services segment (12% year-over-year growth) provide some stability and potential for future earnings growth. The article concludes that while Apple is not a compelling buy at current valuations, it remains a reasonable hold for diversified portfolios. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher due to the negative sentiment from Berkshire's reduced stake and high valuation concerns, but the strong fundamentals provide some support."

It also mentions that Apple's revenue and free cash flow growth have been slow in recent years, which could lead to a decline in stock price if the market becomes nervous. However, the company's growing services segment and ability to generate significant free cash flow could support long-term earnings growth. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is lower than falling in the short term due to valuation concerns, but the company's fundamentals suggest a potential for long-term growth."

While Warren Buffett's continued investment (though significantly reduced) and strong free cash flow are positive, the substantial reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake due to valuation concerns is a major negative. Apple's slow revenue growth and reliance on buybacks to boost EPS further fuel these concerns. The high valuation (31.7 times trailing free cash flow) relative to recent performance is a key driver of the bearish sentiment. The growing services segment offers long-term potential, but it's insufficient to offset the immediate concerns about valuation and growth stagnation.  The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple prediction rounds reinforces the negative outlook.  Considering all factors, including the lack of significant positive catalysts in the news and the overwhelming consensus of previous predictions, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall than a price rise in the short to medium term.  The previous predictions show a strong trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, and I am adjusting my prediction to reflect this consensus."

On one hand, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has significantly reduced its stake in Apple, citing concerns over the company's stretched valuation and stagnant growth in sales and profits. This reduction in holdings may signal a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance, especially given its high valuation (31.7 times trailing free cash flow) and modest revenue growth (1.3% over three years). On the other hand, Apple's strong free cash flow ($108.8 billion over the past 12 months) and growing high-margin services segment (12% year-over-year growth) provide some stability and potential for future earnings growth. The article concludes that while Apple is not a compelling buy at current valuations, it remains a reasonable hold for diversified portfolios. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising in the short term due to the negative sentiment from Berkshire's reduced stake and high valuation concerns, although the strong fundamentals provide some support."

        "headline": "Big Tech earnings, a key Fed meeting, and Trump's first full week in office: What to know this week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) just capped its best first four trading days under a new president since Ronald Reagan's first week in 1985.\n\nThe week ahead will bring investors a deluge of news that will put that rally to the test.\n\nEarnings from more than 100 members of the S&P 500 \u2014 highlighted by results from tech heavyweights Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and Tesla (TSLA) \u2014 are set for release, with Wednesday serving as the week's busiest. Starbucks (SBUX), Exxon (XOM), and Chevron (CVX) are also set to report.\n\nOn Wednesday afternoon, the Federal Reserve will also announce its latest monetary policy decision, with the central bank expected to keep interest rates unchanged and investors focused on what Fed Chair Jay Powell has to say about the balance of 2025.\n\nLast week, the S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC), and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each rallied during a holiday-shortened four day trading week. Over the last five days, the S&P 500 and Dow have gained more than 2.8%; the tech index is leading gains over that period, rising more than 3.1%.\n\nMarkets welcomed Trump's initial days in office as limited news on tariffs steadied investors and a massive AI investment announcement helped boost tech stocks.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(^GSPC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nTrump's moving markets\n\nFour trading days into Trump 2.0, it's been clear that the new president is in the driver's seat of the stock market.\n\nOn Tuesday, markets rallied as the dollar fell after Trump held back from firing off the barrage of universal tariff hikes some expected on his first day in office.\n\nCiti equity strategist Scott Chronert wrote in a note to clients on Friday that throughout the week the implied volatility in rates, the US dollar, and oil all moved lower.\n\n\"The pricing out of some downside policy catalysts was a cross-asset phenomena,\" Chronert said. \"Thus far, we have seen less macro disruption than initially expected.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump sparked an AI rally after he announced a new $500 billion private-sector investment dubbed \"Stargate\" to build artificial intelligence infrastructure in the US, with Oracle (ORCL), ChatGPT creator OpenAI, and Japanese conglomerate SoftBank (9984.T) among those committing to the joint venture.\n\nOracle and SoftBank \u2014 along with Microsoft and Nvidia (NVDA) \u2014 rallied on the news.\n\nIn week one, not only were the market's fears on tariffs not realized, but the still-hot AI trade came back to the fore. A comfortable start to the second Trump administration.\n\nFed back in focus\n\nWith a busier week of market news expected, investor focus on Trump's policies will be tested as the typically market-moving Fed announcement highlights the week's economic news.\n\nStory Continues\n\nData from the CME Group shows markets are pricing in a nearly 100% chance the central bank holds rates steady when it releases its latest policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday. Powell's press conference, slated to start at 2:30 p.m. ET, is likely the larger source of market volatility.\n\nThis past Thursday, Trump said in a virtual appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos that with oil prices going down he'd \"demand that interest rates drop immediately.\" These comments stirred discussion about a potential clash with the Federal Reserve.\n\nEven so, the press conference may be less exciting than normal, according to JPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli. \"Powell\u2019s post-meeting press conference has often stolen the show on FOMC day in recent years,\" Feroli wrote.\n\n\"For next week, however, we expect he will adopt more of a 'duck and cover' approach. In particular, we anticipate he will indicate that each Committee participant is using their own conditioning assumptions on what trade policies are ultimately adopted, and that the only thing decided at the meeting was the monetary policy statement agreed to next Wednesday\"President Donald Trump (L) and Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell at a nomination ceremony at the White House in Washington D.C., in 2017. (Xinhua/Yin Bogu via Getty Images)\u00b7Xinhua News Agency via Getty Images\n\nEconomic health check\n\nSeveral key readings on the health of the US economy are also due out throughout the week.\n\nOn Thursday, the first estimate of fourth quarter GDP is expected to show the US economy grew at an annualized pace of 2.6% in the final three months of 2024, below the 3.1% pace seen in the prior quarter.\n\nFriday will feature a fresh reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, with economists expecting annual \"core\" PCE \u2014 which excludes the volatile categories of food and energy \u2014 to have clocked in at 2.8% in December, unchanged from November. Over the prior month, economists project \"core\" PCE inflation rose 0.2%, faster than the 0.1% seen in November.\n\nRBC Capital Markets head of US rate strategy Blake Gwinn wrote in a note to clients on Friday that the data dump at the end of the week \u2014 combined with Trump's policies \u2014 could leave the Fed \"playing third fiddle\" in markets.\n\nGwinn argued either commentary from Trump or the looming data could \"quickly render stale anything Powell says at next week\u2019s press conference.\"\n\nBig Tech on deck\n\nS&P 500 companies have had a strong start to earnings season. The index is expected to grow earnings by 12.7% compared to the year prior in the fourth quarter, per FactSet data.\n\nBut much of that growth still relies on the performance of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks. And four of those companies \u2014 Tesla, Meta, Microsoft, and Apple \u2014 will report in the week ahead.\n\nThis group of seven tech stocks is expected to grow earnings by 21.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the 9.7% earnings growth projected for the other 493 tech stocks.\n\nAs the chart below shows, this earnings growth gap is expected to narrow throughout 2025, prompting many equity strategists to call for a broadening of the stock market rally outside of large-cap tech.\n\nThough as Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at Barclays, pointed out in his 2025 outlook, given the large earnings growth expected for Big Tech throughout the year, the group is \"likely to remain as critical of an EPS growth driver for the S&P 500 as the group was [in 2024].\"\n\nNotably, earnings growth for the Magnificent Seven is expected to reaccelerate in the second half of the year after a moderate slowdown in the year's first six months.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: Chicago Fed National Activity Index, December (-0.12 previously); New home sales, month-over-month, December (+6.6% expected, +5.9% previously)\n\nEarnings: AT&T (T), Nucor (NUE), SoFi (SOFI), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL)\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Durable goods orders, December (+0.8% expected, -1.2% previously); FHFA house price index, month-over-month, November (+0.4% previously), S&P CoreLogic Case-Shiller home prices, 20-city index, month-over-month seasonally adjusted, November (+0.3% expected, +0.32% previously); Conference Board Consumer Confidence, January (105.6 expected, 104.7 previously); Richmond Fed manufacturing index, January (-10 previously)\n\nEarnings: Boeing (BA), General Motors (GM), JetBlue (JBLU), Lockheed Martin (LMT), Logitech (LOGI), Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL), SAP (SAP), Starbucks (SBUX), Sysco (SYY)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended Jan. 24 (+0.1% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change expected)\n\nEarnings: Tesla (TSLA), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), ADP (ADP), ASML (ASML), General Dynamics (GD), IBM (IBM), Nasdaq (NDAQ), Progressive (PGR), ServiceNow (NOW), T-Mobile (TMUS), V.F.

The economic data releases (GDP and PCE) could influence market sentiment, but RBC Capital Markets suggests they might be overshadowed by Trump's policies. Crucially, Apple is reporting earnings this week, and the performance of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks is critical for overall market growth. Given the positive market momentum and the expectation of strong earnings from Big Tech, there's a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising. However, the potential for negative surprises in earnings or unexpected comments from the Fed or Trump introduces some downside risk.

Apple, being one of the 'Magnificent Seven' tech stocks, is expected to report earnings that could significantly influence the market. The market is currently optimistic, with several factors supporting a positive outlook such as less emphasis on tariffs, AI investments, and overall strong market performance. However, there is a risk associated with the Fed's policy decision and economic data releases, which could introduce volatility."

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMonday- US Markets Closed for Martin Luther King Jr. Day\n\nApple\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Jefferies downgraded Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) to Underperform with a $200.75 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Jefferies downgrades Apple on weak iPhone sales. AI outlook and growth targets missed.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Jefferies lowers forecasts due to weak iPhone sales and the general consumer electronics market, citing a reduced outlook for iPhone 17/18 due to slower AI uptake and commercialization.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss its revenue growth guidance of 5% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2025 and to guide to only low single-digit revenue growth in the second quarter, also below consensus.\n\nThe AI outlook remains subdued, with industry checks suggesting delays in Apple's advanced packaging roadmap for iPhone as another negative sign. Jefferies' new price target implies a 13% downside, leading to this downgrade.\n\nFord\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, Barclays (LON:BARC) downgraded Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) to Equal-weight with an $11 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Barclays downgrades Ford due to 2025 headwinds. Uncertain cost improvement paths expected.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Barclays analysts acknowledge Ford's ongoing transformation efforts, but anticipate significant volume headwinds in 2025, driven by inventory destocking and modest price normalization, which may negatively impact earnings estimates.\n\nWhile cost reduction has potential, with opportunities to narrow the cost gap compared to competitors, Barclays highlights the uncertainty surrounding the path to cost improvement. The Tier 1 desk's 2025 EPS estimate of $1.44 falls below Bloomberg's consensus of $1.63, reflecting their cautious outlook on Ford's earnings profile.\n\nVeeva Systems\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Goldman Sachs double downgraded Veeva Systems Inc (NYSE:VEEV) (NYSE:VEEV) to Sell with a $261 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Goldman views Veeva as entrenched but faces competition and slow recovery. Veeva's underperformance expected relative to other coverage.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Goldman continues to view Veeva as deeply entrenched in its core Life Sciences customer base, with significant cross-selling potential over the next decade. However, the global investment bank identifies several medium-term risks to Veeva\u2019s 2030 targets. These include competition from Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) in the Commercial sector, which is expected to be a persistent headwind, and a slow fundamental recovery in the Life Sciences vertical, likely to impact customer expansion and renewal deals.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAdditionally, Veeva\u2019s maturing product portfolio may pose challenges for newer product cycles to drive substantial growth.\n\nGoldman projects that Veeva will underperform relative to other coverage over the next 12 months, despite limited absolute downside risk given its free cash flow support and multiple quarters of underperformance. The bank is more cautious on medium-term fundamentals, and its revised price target implies a 13% downside risk compared to an average 11% upside for its Buy and Neutral-rated names.\n\nTwilio\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Baird upgraded Twilio Inc (NYSE:TWLO) to Outperform with a $160 price target.\n\n*TLDR: Baird bullish on TWLO's revenue and valuation. Profitability, gains, and capital returns expected to rise.\n\nWhat\u2019s the full story? Thursday, Baird attended TWLO's investor day, buoyed by a pre-released Q4 upside and broad-based strength. The brokerage emerged more confident in TWLO's capacity to sustain double-digit revenue growth, anticipating further upside to guidance and estimates.\n\nAcknowledging recent gains they had been cautious to chase, Baird now expects a potential beat-and-raise pattern to drive shares higher, especially with improving profitability, cash flow, and capital returns. Valuation is still deemed reasonable, particularly given possible upside scenarios.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet Calls of the Week\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock faces downgrades; New Street-high PT for Tesla\n\nAnalyst lists 10 key questions for the power sector in 2025\n\nView Comments",

(AAPL), which is generally perceived as a strong positive signal due to Buffett's reputation as a value investor. This endorsement is likely to boost investor confidence and attract buying interest, especially from those who follow Buffett's investment moves. The dividend-paying aspect adds another layer of attractiveness for income-seeking investors. However, the headline's question 'Is it a buy now?' introduces some uncertainty, suggesting that the market may have already priced in Buffett's influence. Previous predictions from various models consistently show a higher probability of the stock price rising, clustering around 0.6-0.7 for a rise and 0.3-0.4 for a fall. Given the overwhelmingly positive sentiment and the lack of negative fundamental news, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling. The consensus from other models supports this view, with a trend of slightly increasing probabilities of a rise in later rounds. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, acknowledging the potential for the news to be already factored into the price."

        "headline": "Apple Receives Rare Underperform Rating from Wall Street Analyst. Is It Time to Sell the Stock?",
        "content": "In a rare move, analysts at Jefferies downgraded one of the largest companies in the world, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), to underperform. Wall Street analysts are known for being bullish, so underperform and sell ratings tend to make up only a small percentage of overall analyst ratings.\n\nFor its part, Jefferies sees weak iPhone shipments in the fourth quarter, with Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) features not resonating with consumers. It cited a survey that most U.S. consumers do not find AI features very useful. As such, it thinks this is an indication that there will not be an AI power upgrade cycle for the iPhone.\n\nJefferies expects Apple to miss current analyst revenue estimates, calling for 5% growth when it reports its Q4 results at the end of January. It also thinks there is a good possibility Apple's Q1 guidance could disappoint as well. Its price target for the stock is $200.75.\n\nGiven the rare underperform rating, many investors may be wondering if it's time to sell the stock.\n\nA strong business model\n\nDespite the downgrade related to iPhone sales projections, one thing has not changed: Apple has a strong business model. The company's revenue growth was pretty lackluster throughout its fiscal 2024 ended in September. It only grew its revenue 2% on the year and 6% for its fiscal Q4. Revenue growth for its devices, meanwhile, has been even worse. Product revenue actually fell by 1% for its fiscal year, while rising by 4% last fiscal quarter.\n\nWhere Apple has seen stronger growth is in its high-margin services revenue. This includes revenue from its App Store, search-sharing revenue, Apple TV, Apple Pay, and other subscriptions and services. Last fiscal year, its services revenue climbed 13% and was up 12% in Q4.\n\nIts services gross margin is close to 74%, while its product gross margin is about 37%. With the services margin nearly double, revenue coming from services more easily drops to bottom-line profits. As such, the company was able to grow its adjusted earnings per share by 11% last year to $6.75, despite only a 2% increase in revenue.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRight now, it appears that the big iPhone upgrade cycle related to Apple Intelligence is not materializing. The company has had some issues with its offering, such as its AI producing inaccurate news alerts. Meanwhile, both iPhone and Android smartphone users in surveys have indicated that that AI features are adding little to no value. Then there is the whole question of whether users will eventually pay for AI subscription services. Right now for Apple, AI seems to be more of a cost without any offsetting revenue benefit.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company also hasn't been able to include Apple Intelligence with its smartphones in China. It had already been struggling in the country against local competitors, and according to Counterpoint Research, iPhone sales plunged in China by 18% in Q4. Sales of smartphones from rival Huawei, meanwhile, climbed 15.5% in the quarter.\n\nApple initially saw strong iPhone sales in China after it debuted its latest version. However, its AI is not approved in China and it must find a local AI partner to incorporate its technology to run Apple Intelligence in China. Apple mostly competes in the premium smartphone market in China, so the lack of the latest AI technology has left it behind competitors.\n\nOutside of smartphone sales, Apple also faces another big risk related the Alphabet antitrust case. Alphabet has been paying Apple an estimated $20 billion a year as part of its revenue-sharing model for Google to be the default search engine for its browser Safari. This revenue is also virtually pure margin, dropping right to operating income. With Alphabet losing its antitrust case and this agreement in jeopardy, the impact it eventually could have on this revenue stream is still very much in the air as the case could lead to some pretty big changes. However, any impact is likely years away as the ruling gets appealed and both companies have reason to try to protect what is currently in place.\n\nExpanding valuation\n\nApple stock has seen a lot of multiple expansion in the past several years. Its trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has essentially tripled from 12 times to 36 times, while its forward P/E based on current fiscal year estimates is around 30 times.AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts\n\nSome of this multiple expansion can be attributed to the shift toward high-margin services revenue, as these businesses tend to carry higher multiples than hardware businesses. Apple has also proven to be a steady business that tends to have a somewhat predictable, albeit lengthening, replacement cycle.\n\nThat said, with the hope of an iPhone upgrade cycle diminishing and the stock seeing a lot of multiple expansion in the past six years, I think it would be smart to take some profits on the stock.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The rare 'underperform' rating from Jefferies is a significant negative signal, especially given the analyst's concerns about weak iPhone shipments, lack of AI resonance, and potential revenue and guidance misses. The price target of $200.75 also suggests downside. However, the article also highlights Apple's strong business model, particularly its high-margin services revenue, which continues to grow and contribute significantly to earnings. The potential loss of revenue from the Alphabet antitrust case is a long-term risk, but not an immediate threat. The multiple expansion of the stock suggests it may be overvalued. The negative sentiment surrounding AI features and challenges in the Chinese market further weigh on the stock. Considering these factors, the negative aspects seem to outweigh the positives in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise."

                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While a rare underperform rating from Jefferies, citing weak iPhone shipments and underwhelming AI features, suggests a potential price drop, several counterpoints exist. Apple's strong business model, particularly its high-margin services revenue, provides a buffer against solely focusing on device sales.  The concern about AI features not resonating with consumers is significant, especially considering the lack of AI integration in China, a key market. However, the article also highlights the potential for years-long legal battles to impact Apple's revenue from Alphabet, mitigating the immediate impact. The article's mention of past multiple expansions and the current high P/E ratio suggests the stock might be overvalued, increasing the likelihood of a correction.  Considering these factors, a price drop seems more probable in the short term due to the negative analyst rating and concerns about iPhone sales, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong due to the robust services segment. The probability estimates reflect this balanced perspective, leaning slightly towards a price fall in the near term."

The rare underperform rating from Jefferies is a significant negative, driven by concerns about weak iPhone sales, underwhelming AI features, and potential revenue misses. This negative sentiment is amplified by Apple's struggles in the crucial Chinese market.  The $200.75 price target further reinforces the bearish outlook. However, Apple's strong business model, particularly its high-margin services revenue, offers a counterbalance.  This consistent growth in services mitigates some of the negative impact from weaker hardware sales.  The Alphabet antitrust case is a long-term risk, not an immediate threat.  The high P/E ratio suggests potential overvaluation, increasing the likelihood of a correction.  Considering the confluence of factors, and observing the consistent bearish predictions from previous models (averaging around 0.7 probability of a fall), I lean towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.  The long-term prospects remain strong due to the services segment, but the short-term impact of the negative news is likely to be more pronounced."

        "content": "Apple Stock Nears Critical Level Amid Worst Start To The Year Since 2008: 'When You Get Names Starting To Flirt With It...You Kind Of Lose Confidence'\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has had a turbulent beginning to 2025, with its shares approaching a significant level that could signal further losses if breached, according to analysts.\n\nWhat Happened: Since the start of the year, the tech behemoth\u2019s stock has plummeted by 11%, making it the weakest\u00a0performer in the \u2018Magnificent 7\u2019\u00a0group. This downturn is in stark contrast to the S&P 500, which has seen a 4% gain, reaching a new record high.\n\nDon\u2019t Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nApple is experiencing its most challenging beginning of the year since 2008. The stock\u2019s drop has brought it near the 200-day moving average, a critical technical indicator seen by many traders as a long-term support level.\n\n\u201cWhen\u00a0you get names starting to\u00a0flirt with it or start\u00a0to break below it, you\u00a0kind of lose confidence that\u00a0the uptrend of that name\u00a0is still intact,\u201d Todd Sohn, an ETF\u00a0and technical strategist at Strategas\u00a0Securities LLC, told Bloomberg.\n\nWhy It Matters: Apple\u2019s position is now precarious. Until recently, it was the world's most valuable company and had the largest weighting in the S&P 500 Index. However, amid its decline, Nvidia has now overtaken Apple in market value.\n\nDespite Apple\u2019s selloff, the S&P 500 has continued to rally. However, if other major tech stocks start to decline, it could signal trouble for the bull market, now in its third year. \"It definitely has the potential to create some more risk for those major indices.

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Bear Market Stock To Invest In Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Bear Market Stocks To Invest In Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best bear market stocks to invest in now.\n\nAs of January 2025, the prevailing sentiment among US economic experts leans towards cautious optimism regarding the stock market\u2019s trajectory. While concerns about potential downturns exist, explicit predictions of a bear market in 2025 are not prominent. For example, economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal have adjusted their forecasts, anticipating higher inflation and interest rates in the coming years. They note that inflation has been higher than expected, with the consumer-price index rising 2.9% in December, leading to projections of continued inflation momentum into 2025. Despite these concerns, the US economy has demonstrated resilience, driven by strong consumer spending and a declining unemployment rate, which fell to 4.1% in December. Consequently, economists estimate a 22% chance of a recession in the next 12 months, marking the lowest probability in three years.\n\nJeremy Siegel, a renowned economist from the Wharton School, suggests that the stock market could experience a cooling-off period in 2025, particularly within the technology sector, amid concerns over the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence. He also anticipates that interest rates might decline, which could influence market dynamics. Additionally, MarketWatch reports that foreign retail investors have been purchasing US stocks at unprecedented rates, with $76.5 billion acquired in the last three months. Historically, such surges in foreign investment have preceded market downturns, as observed before the 1987 crash, the 2000 dot-com bubble burst, and the 2008 financial crisis. This pattern suggests that increased foreign investment may serve as a contrary indicator, signaling potential market peaks.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nSeveral economic experts also predict a bear market in 2025. For example, Cem Karsan, a volatility trader and founder of Kai Volatility, foresees a possible stock market decline of up to 40% within the next year, per a report by MarketWatch. He emphasizes that the Federal Reserve\u2019s management of rate cuts and market expectations will be crucial. Karsan predicts that the 10-year Treasury yield could surpass 6% by the third quarter, which would exert additional pressure on stocks. He suggests that the Fed\u2019s approach can either delay or accelerate the decline; a dovish stance might prolong the market rally but lead to a harder drop, whereas a hawkish stance could cause an earlier slide.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSimilarly, Paul Krugman, a Nobel laureate and economist, has raised concerns that aggressive policy measures, such as imposing tariffs on China, could lead to inflation spikes and trade wars, potentially destabilizing the economy. He warns that such policies might exacerbate inflation and pressure the US labor market, contributing to economic instability. While these experts highlight potential risks, it\u2019s important to note that market predictions are inherently uncertain. Other analysts maintain a more optimistic outlook for 2025. For instance, JP Morgan Research anticipates robust global economic growth, with the exception of a slowdown in China, and projects a price target of 6,500 for the S&P 500, with earnings per share of $270.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nOur list of the best bear market stocks to buy is grounded in hedge fund sentiment towards each stock. These selections are derived from sectors such as consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, given their historical resilience and stability even during economic downturns. A considerable number of these stocks present enticing annual dividend yields and possess defensive attributes that enable them to maintain stability in a bear market. Additionally, we\u2019ve identified promising tech stocks that currently pose as appealing entry opportunities for investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company emerges as a prime investment opportunity for several reasons. First and foremost, the company\u2019s robust financial health is depicted in the report for the fourth quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue was $94.9 billion, increasing 6% year over year, and quarterly diluted earnings per share was $0.97. This shows the increasing demand for the company\u2019s products or services and its ability to generate earnings for shareholders. Moreover, the company has a consistent record of returning value to shareholders through dividends and share repurchase programs. In fiscal 2024, the company declared quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, totaling $0.96 per share annually. Secondly, the company has also introduced a general health-monitoring tool in all its new devices. For instance, an Apple Watch can monitor heart rate, check for atrial fibrillation, detect falls and car crashes, monitor blood-oxygen levels, and track body temperature for fertility planning.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of best bear market stocks to invest in now. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The article suggests that AAPL's strong ecosystem and defensive attributes make it a stable investment during economic downturns. However, the overall sentiment in the market is mixed, with some experts predicting a potential stock market decline of up to 40%.

The suggestion that other stocks might offer better returns also weighs against Apple.  Analysis of previous predictions shows a convergence towards a roughly even split between rise and fall probabilities.

        "headline": "BT urges competition crackdown to block Apple\u2019s stranglehold on smartphones",
        "content": "BT van\n\nBT has called for a competition crackdown on Apple over concerns the tech giant could use its smartphone market power to squeeze out mobile networks.\n\nThe operator has raised concerns that the rise of virtual \u201ceSims\u201d that replace Sim cards could see smartphone makers tighten their grip on the market.\n\nIn a submission to the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), BT said: \u201cWe also encourage the CMA to consider the risk of disintermediation in the telecoms industry with respect to eSims, which is an additional area where handset providers could exercise their strong market position.\u201d\n\nPhysical Sim cards have long been a critical link between network operators and their customers. But the growth of eSims means BT and its rivals risk losing ground to the likes of Apple and Samsung, who are increasingly selling phones directly to consumers.\n\nThe threat is particularly acute as telecoms companies try to expand their offering beyond traditional mobile services, amid tough competition and shrinking margins.\n\nBT, which is side-lining its brand in favour of EE, has outlined plans to start selling other products and services from fridges to insurance. It has also launched a new service and smartphone app, dubbed EE ID, in a bid to expand its customer base.\n\nHowever, industry executives fear these efforts could be undermined as tech companies increasingly build a direct relationship with their customers.\n\nKester Mann, of industry analyst CCS Insight, said: \u201cOne of the challenges is that network provisioning starts to become more remote, therefore there\u2019s less opportunity for operators to engage with customers, whether that\u2019s selling new products or getting a sense check on how they\u2019re feeling.\n\n\u201cIt feels like it\u2019s another part of the journey that is cutting operators out the loop a little bit, so I think that\u2019s one of the reasons why they\u2019ve been a little bit reluctant to embrace the eSim concept.\u201d\n\nIn the most extreme scenario, companies such as Apple could use eSims to launch their own virtual mobile networks \u2013 similar to the likes of GiffGaff and Tesco Mobile \u2013 though analysts said this was unlikely in the near term.\n\neSims were not mentioned in an investigation into Apple and Google launched by the CMA last week, which focused on web browsers and smartphone app stores.\n\nApple introduced its first eSim iPhone in 2022 and all of its US devices are now eSim only, with a similar move expected in Europe as soon as this year.\n\nBT is not alone in sounding the alarm over the rise of eSims. Virgin Media O2 has also raised concerns about tech giants tightening their grip on mobile markets.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIn a separate Ofcom submission published in 2022, the company said: \u201cIncreased competition may deliver short-term benefits to consumers of mobile services, but there are genuine concerns around the potential ability of big tech to leverage their strong position in the supply of operating systems and their control over their vertically integrated ecosystems in a way that undermines competition and delivery of good outcomes in mobile markets in the long run.\u201d\n\nVodafone also has a team of people working to address concerns about the strength of big tech. However, industry sources cautioned that operators had lucrative partnerships with tech companies and were keen to maintain good relations.\n\nApple did not comment on the BT submission.\n\nIn response to last week\u2019s CMA investigation it said: \u201cApple believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.\n\n\u201cIn the UK alone, the iOS app economy supports hundreds of thousands of jobs and makes it possible for developers big and small to reach users on a trusted platform.\n\n\u201cWe will continue to engage constructively with the CMA as their work on this matter progresses.\u201d\n\nView Comments",

While the article mentions Apple's response emphasizing competition and innovation, the core issue is a potential threat to Apple's future revenue streams and market dominance. The CMA investigation, though not directly related to eSIMs, indicates a growing regulatory interest in Apple's market power. The negative sentiment from telecom operators and the potential for regulatory action suggest a higher probability of a stock price decrease than increase. However, Apple is a large and diversified company, and this issue is unlikely to have a catastrophic impact.

        "content": "For years, the world's biggest media companies struggled to make money off of their streaming services. The culprits: pricey content, user churn, and lots of competition.\n\nIn 2024, that finally changed.\n\nThe five giants \u2014 Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), Paramount (PARA), NBCUniversal's Peacock (CMCSA), and Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (WBD) \u2014 collectively reported a profit in the first nine months of the year for the very first time. In total, those five companies delivered earnings of roughly $5.9 billion, significantly ahead of the $142 million loss the group reported in the year-ago period.\n\nNetflix led the charge, pulling in roughly $6.9 billion in earnings in the first three quarters. (Wall Street declared the company the unofficial winner of the streaming wars.) But there's more: Earlier this week the company reported an additional $1.87 billion in profits to end the fourth quarter \u2014 and nearly 20 million more subscribers.\n\nThe other four media giants will report fourth quarter results later this month and next, with Comcast first up on Jan. 30. A big question for investors is whether or not traditional players can successfully follow the leader.\n\nLast year delivered some early answers. Disney and Paramount Global each reported their first quarter of streaming profits in August. Also, Peacock significantly narrowed year-over-year losses, while WBD's streaming profits ended the year on positive footing.\n\nMacquarie analyst Tim Nollen categorized the improvements as \"progress,\" but cautioned that even the streamers who have hit profitability don't have enough profits to generate significant margins. Most, with the obvious exception of Netflix, have hit just around breakeven.\n\nFor Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin, the key to success is \"the pace of revenue growth.\" He added, \"To me, profits are a lot about scale. ... So if you can increase scale, which we saw some benefits from this past year, then you can maintain profitability.\"\n\nFor traditional media companies, he continued, being profitable isn't enough. \"Because they have terrible linear businesses that continue to decline, they need streaming to be more than just profitable. They need streaming to produce fast-growing profits.\"\n\nWhat lies ahead\n\nThe \"streaming wars,\" which unofficially kicked off in November 2019 following the launch of Disney's flagship streaming platform, set off an accelerated race for content, talent, and subscribers. That led to an era of overspending as platforms, both new and established, raced to lure top producers and secure the most sought-after shows.\n\nStory Continues\n\nBut investors quickly realized that it's difficult to monetize users, justify the high cost of content, keep subscribers engaged, and turn a profit. One of the biggest reasons: streaming's low price point. With the exception of cable replacement services like YouTube TV and Hulu + Live TV, prices can range anywhere from $4.99 a month to $22.99.\n\nThat low cost means more subscribers are needed to generate significant returns. Lourdes Balduque via Getty Images\n\nIn response to investors' growing profit fears, companies adjusted their strategies and were eventually able to attract more subscribers through controversial password-sharing crackdowns and multi-tier subscription offerings, in addition to more strategic content acquisitions and the return of key original programming.\n\nCompanies also shifted how aggressively they spend their money. Instead of ballooning content budgets and releasing as many shows as possible, streamers pulled back to focus on more quality over quantity projects.\n\n\"Everything was kind of messy for a few years,\" Macquarie's Nollen said. \"Streamers are finally getting the revenue and cost lines to balance out. But it's questionable how profitable these services can be.\"\n\n(edited)\n\nOne obstacle to achieving consistent profits is combating increased churn in the face of higher prices. (Netflix became the latest platform to boost subscription costs in the US, bumping the prices of its various tiers earlier this week.)\n\n\"The bigger risk is really retaining the customer base and figuring out whether we get to a threshold where there are too many platforms,\" Morningstar's Dolgin said. Also, \"there's a limit\" to how much more streamers can raise prices. Simultaneously, there's a limit to how many more subscribers streamers can add.\n\n\"Somewhere, you need to get that right in order to keep profits growing at a good pace,\" he said.\n\nTo combat fickle subscribers, competing platforms are now bundling their services together. As WBD CEO David Zaslav told investors last year, \"There's more strength together.\"\n\n\"I have a difficult time envisioning a scenario where any one of these players takes Netflix's mantle,\" Dolgin said. \"So [bundling with one another] is how they close the gap. They don't do it individually. They could potentially do it as a collective.\"\n\nAnd if recent news of mass layoffs and restructurings are any indication (Case in point: CNN's digital revamp), the road to catching up to Netflix \u2014 and just basic survival in the streaming-first era \u2014 might be a bumpy one.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NFLX)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "headline": "Is There An Opportunity With Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 20% Undervaluation?",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nApple's estimated fair value is US$279 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Apple's US$223 share price signals that it might be 20% undervalued Our fair value estimate is 13% higher than Apple's analyst price target of US$246\n\nToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.\n\nWe generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Apple\n\nThe Method\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 2034 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$124.1b US$130.4b US$156.7b US$178.3b US$200.4b US$217.0b US$231.3b US$243.8b US$254.9b US$265.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x13 Analyst x14 Analyst x5 Analyst x2 Analyst x2 Est @ 8.29% Est @ 6.59% Est @ 5.40% Est @ 4.57% Est @ 3.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3%  US$115.6k US$113.3k US$126.8k US$134.5k US$140.9k US$142.2k US$141.2k US$138.7k US$135.2k US$131.0k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.3t\n\nStory Continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.6%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.3%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2034 \u00d7 (1 + g) \u00f7 (r \u2013 g) = US$265b\u00d7 (1 + 2.6%) \u00f7 (7.3%\u2013 2.6%) = US$5.8t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.8t\u00f7 ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$2.9t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$4.2t. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$223, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 20% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.NasdaqGS:AAPL Discounted Cash Flow January 25th 2025\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Apple as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.137. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Apple\n\nStrength\n\nDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.\n\nWeakness\n\nEarnings declined over the past year.\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Tech market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The article also mentions analyst price targets being higher than the current price, further supporting a potential price increase. However, the article also points out risks and weaknesses, such as declining earnings and slower growth compared to the overall American market. The SWOT analysis presents a mixed picture. Considering the undervaluation claim, analyst targets, and the general positive sentiment around Apple, there's a higher probability of the stock price rising.

However, the DCF model relies on several assumptions, including future cash flow projections and discount rates, which inherently involve uncertainty.  While the analysis points towards potential upside, it's crucial to acknowledge the limitations of DCF models.  The article itself highlights the imprecise nature of valuation and cautions against solely relying on this method.  Furthermore, the analysis doesn't incorporate other market factors or potential negative news that could impact the stock price. Therefore, assigning a high probability to a price rise solely based on this analysis would be premature. A more balanced approach considers both the potential upside and the inherent risks and uncertainties involved."

The DCF model, while not flawless, is a widely respected valuation method. The article also notes that Apple's fair value estimate is 13% higher than the analyst price target of $246, indicating potential upside. Given the positive valuation gap and the general market tendency to correct undervaluation over time, there is a reasonable probability that the stock price could rise. However, the DCF model's assumptions (e.g., growth rates, discount rate) are subject to uncertainty, and external factors (e.g., market sentiment, macroeconomic conditions) could also influence the stock price. The article does not highlight any immediate negative catalysts, so the probability of a fall is lower but not negligible."

The forecasted earnings growth over the next three years further supports this. However, the weaknesses (declining earnings last year, slower growth than the market) and the inherent limitations of DCF models temper the optimism. Previous rounds consistently predicted a higher probability of a price rise, generally around 0.65-0.72, but with a slight downward trend in the last round. Considering this trend and the continued undervaluation signal, I'll maintain a similar stance, but slightly adjust downwards to account for the mentioned weaknesses and the general market uncertainty. The fact that the analyst target is lower than the DCF fair value also suggests some caution. I am also considering the risks mentioned in the article, such as the 2 warning signs and management's action."

This is a significant potential upside. However, the DCF model has limitations and relies on assumptions about future cash flows and discount rates.  The previous predictions from multiple models show a consensus leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise (mostly between 0.6 and 0.7), reflecting cautious optimism. While the undervaluation is compelling, inherent uncertainties in any valuation model, especially a DCF, prevent assigning an extremely high probability to a price rise. The article itself stresses the imprecise nature of valuation.  Furthermore, the analysis doesn't incorporate other market factors or potential negative news that could impact the stock price. The SWOT analysis reveals both strengths (debt coverage, growth opportunities) and weaknesses (declining earnings, slower growth than the market). Considering the consensus of previous models, the inherent risks, and the mixed SWOT analysis, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the possibility of a price fall due to unforeseen circumstances or market corrections. The consistent, though slightly decreasing, upward trend in predictions across rounds also suggests a growing belief in the potential for a price increase, but not a guarantee.  I'm adjusting the probability slightly downward to reflect the inherent uncertainties and the mixed signals from the analysis, converging towards the average of previous predictions while acknowledging the inherent limitations of the DCF model and the presence of both positive and negative factors."

Considering the lack of direct positive or negative catalysts in the news and the general positive trend of including Apple in these elite groups, a slightly positive bias is warranted."

        "headline": "Warren Buffett Could Make Over $3 Billion in Dividend Income in 2025 From These 5 Stocks",
        "content": "The late Senator Everett Dirksen once reportedly said, \"A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you're talking about real money.\" With that quote in mind, Warren Buffett's dividend income this year will be real money.\n\nTechnically, the dividend income will belong to Berkshire Hathaway. But for many, Buffett and Berkshire are practically synonymous. And they could make over $3 billion in dividend income in 2025 from these five stocks.\n\n1. Bank of America\n\nBuffett seems to have soured somewhat on Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). He significantly reduced Berkshire's stake in the big bank last year. However, Bank of America (BofA) still contributes a lot of cash to the conglomerate's coffers.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, 2024, Berkshire owned 766,305,462 shares of BofA. With the company's forward dividend of $1.04, that translates to nearly $797 million in dividend income this year. Of course, if Buffett sells more of this stock, the amount of dividends received will be lower.\n\n2. The Coca-Cola Company\n\nThe Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) is one of Buffett's \"forever stocks.\" He's held it the longest of any other stock in Berkshire's portfolio. In his 2022 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, Buffett wrote, \"The cash dividend we received from Coke in 1994 was $75 million. By 2022, the dividend had increased to $704 million.\" That total should be even greater this year.\n\nBerkshire has owned 400 million shares of Coca-Cola for a long time. Coke pays a forward dividend of $1.94. If Buffett doesn't sell any shares (which seems to be a safe assumption), Berkshire will rake in at least $776 million in dividend income from the big food and beverage company this year. The amount will likely be higher, though. Coca-Cola is a Dividend King with 62 consecutive years of dividend increases. I fully expect the company will keep that streak going in 2025.\n\n3. Chevron\n\nChevron(NYSE: CVX) is a more recent addition to Berkshire's portfolio. Buffett initiated a stake in the giant oil and gas producer in 2020 when its shares were beaten down due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nBerkshire owned 118,610,534 shares of Chevron at the end of the third quarter of 2024. With the company's dividend of $6.52, the conglomerate should make at least $773.3 million in dividend income this year. Again, though, the actual total will likely be higher. Chevron has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years and could boost its payout soon.\n\n4. American Express\n\nBuffett wrote to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year that American Express(NYSE: AXP) would \"almost certainly\" increase its dividends in 2024 by around 16%. He was close. Amex increased its dividend payout by nearly 17%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe legendary investor also wrote that Berkshire would \"most certainly leave our holdings untouched throughout the year.\" I suspect it will do the same in 2025. If so, Berkshire's 151,610,700 shares of American Express with the financial services company's dividend of $2.80 will add up to at least $424.5 million in dividend income this year.\n\n5. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't the apple of Buffett's eye that it once was. His position in the consumer tech giant is much lower now than it was a couple of years ago. However, Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding. It's also still an important source of dividend income.\n\nThe math with Apple is easy. Berkshire owned 300 million shares as of Sept. 30, 2024. With a dividend of $1 per share, that translates to $300 million in dividend income for Buffett and his company in 2025. This amount will change if Apple increases its dividend (which is likely) or Buffett sells more of the stock (which could happen).\n\nWhich is the best stock of the five for income investors?\n\nThe expected dividend income for Buffett and Berkshire from these five stocks in 2025 totals $3.07 billion. Which is the best pick for income investors?\n\nI think income investors who aren't billionaires will find several of Buffett's major income producers attractive picks. Coca-Cola offers an especially impressive dividend track record along with a solid forward dividend yield of 3.14%.\n\nHowever, my vote goes to Chevron as the best stock of the five for income investors. The oil and gas company has the highest dividend yield of the group (4.17%). It has also reliably increased its dividend.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Chevron wasn\u2019t one of them.

The mixed signals (reduced position but still a major holding and likely dividend increase) suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on Apple's stock price. The broader market sentiment and other factors not mentioned in the article (e.g., earnings, product launches) would also play a role. Given the lack of significant news, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, but the mild positive signal could slightly increase the probability of the stock price rising."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other top trending AI stocks on Wall Street.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has recently announced a private sector investment to build more AI data centers, marking yet another effort by the US government to stay ahead in the race for supremacy in artificial intelligence.\n\nA prominent player in the field has been OpenAI, the artificial intelligence startup known to have started the AI arms race in the first place. In its latest, OpenAI has recently previewed an AI agent that can carry out tasks on the web for users. This move seeks to enhance its chatbot amidst intensifying competition.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Buzzing AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings and 11 AI Stocks That Should Be On Your Watchlist\n\nDubbed the \u201cOperator\u201d, the tool is powered by a model that allows it to interact with on-screen buttons, menus, and text fields.\n\n\u201cThis capability marks the next step in AI development, allowing models to use the same tools humans rely on daily and opening the door to a vast range of new applications\u201d.\n\nOpenAI says Operator is \u201can agent that can go to the web to perform tasks for you\u201d. As such, companies are increasingly using agents like these to assist in tasks and execute actions without direct human intervention. Currently available to Pro users in the US, the Operator can perform numerous tasks, such as creating to-do lists or assisting in planning vacations.\n\nThe company states that it eventually plans to expand the Operator to Plus, Team, and Enterprise users and will be integrating Operator into ChatGPT. It also revealed how the tool currently faces trouble with some tasks, such as managing calendars and creating slideshows.\n\n\u201cOperator is one of our first agents, which are AIs capable of doing work for you independently. You give it a task and it will execute it\u201d.\n\nBased on trends in artificial intelligence, agents are the next big advancement in the AI field. Even Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang agrees that they are. Artificial Intelligence agents are autonomous intelligent systems that can perform specific tasks without human intervention.\n\n\u201cAI agents are going to get deployed. I think this year we\u2019re going to see it take off\u201d.\n\nAccording to him, areas such as software engineering, digital marketing, and customer service are the first where AI agents can add value. As for his company, it is already using AI agents in chip design.\n\nStory Continues\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Expanding AI Features with Apple Intelligence and Ecosystem Strength\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls for Thursday, January 23, has been for Apple Inc. Goldman Sachs reiterated the stock as \u201cBuy\u201d and lowered its price target to $280 per share from $286. The price target downgrade, driven by lower iPhone sales, comes ahead of the company\u2019s December-quarter earnings report next week. The firm anticipates the tech giant to report fiscal Q1 earnings per share of $2.35, in line with consensus, and revenue of $124.2B versus the consensus of $124.8B. According to the firm, even though the competition within the Chinese market is increasing, it is optimistic about accelerating iPhone growth in fiscal 2026. This iPhone growth will largely be driven by the continued rollout of Apple Intelligence with a more robust feature set.\n\n\u201cWe anticipate market sentiment to improve midyear, which is a seasonally strong period for the stock, as concerns about Apple Intelligence\u2019s limited impact on iPhone demand and competition in China are replaced by optimism over the new slate of Apple Intelligence features revealed at WWDC 2025, the launch of new Mac, iPad and iPhone SE products in spring 2025, and potential new features for the iPhone 17/18 in fall 2025/26\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of top trending AI stocks on Wall Street. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The anticipation of a strong midyear performance and the potential for new product launches could support a rise in stock price, but the immediate concerns about revenue growth and competition in the Chinese market weigh heavily.

The positive aspects are Apple's strong ecosystem, the potential of Apple Intelligence, and the anticipation of new product launches in 2025-2026.

The previous predictions show a lack of strong consensus, fluctuating between slightly bearish and slightly bullish, with a slight tendency towards a price fall.  Considering the immediate negative factors (lowered price target, slower revenue growth) and the uncertainty surrounding the impact of Apple Intelligence in the short term, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is more likely in the near term.

        "headline": "Billionaire Steven Cohen Sells Apple Stock and Buys a Little-Known AI Stock Up 500% in Less Than 3 Years",
        "content": "Steven Cohen runs Point72 Asset Management, a hedge fund that has earned $38 billion in profits since its inception in 1992. That makes him the 12th-most successful hedge fund manager in history, according to LCH Investments.\n\nIn the third quarter, Cohen sold his entire stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), formerly his second-largest holding excluding options. He also started a small position in Axon Enterprise(NASDAQ: AXON), an artificial intelligence (AI) stock up 500% in the last 30 months. The new position is relatively small, but it still means Cohen was more comfortable owning Axon than Apple.\n\nImportantly, Cohen is an excellent source of inspiration, given his track record, but those trades took place in the third quarter, and the fourth-quarter update isn't due for a few weeks. So, here is a more current look at Apple and Axon.\n\nApple: The stock Cohen sold in the third quarter\n\nApple has cultivated immense brand authority through engineering expertise. The company enjoys a strong presence in several consumer electronics markets, including a leadership position in smartphones in terms of revenue. Consumer loyalty has also helped Apple grow its services business. But the company is beset by headwinds that threaten to drag on profitability in the coming years.\n\nApple's iPhone has lost significant market share in China. The company has yet to announce financial results for the December quarter, but Counterpoint Research says iPhone sales declined more than 18% in that period. Consequently, after leading the China market in smartphone sales in 2023, Apple failed to rank among the top three sellers in 2024.\n\nFurthermore, Apple could lose $20 billion in annual services revenue if federal judge Amit Mehta prohibits Alphabet's Google from paying for default search placement in the Safari browser. His decision is expected in August 2025, and a long appeals process may follow, but analysts estimate Apple could lose 4% to 6% of its profits if the deal is prohibited.\n\nAdditionally, many analysts anticipated a historic iPhone upgrade cycle following the introduction of AI features (called Apple Intelligence) in October, but that has yet to materialized. Indeed, Craig Moffett at MoffettNathanson recently wrote, \"Not only have we not seen any sign of an upgrade cycle, but we have seen growing evidence that consumers are unmoved by AI functionality.\"\n\nFinally, Wall Street expects Apple's earnings to increase 9% over the next year. That consensus makes the current valuation of 33 times earnings look expensive. Moreover, while Apple stock has returned 72% in the last two years, its price-to-earnings ratio has also increased 72% over that period. That means shares moved higher on multiple expansion alone, not earnings growth.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should avoid this stock.\n\nAxon Enterprise: The stock Cohen bought in the third quarter\n\nAxon is a public safety company that works with U.S. law enforcement, the federal government, commercial enterprises, and certain international governments. While Axon is best known for conducted energy devices sold under the Taser brand, the company also provides body cameras and other sensors that integrate with software for digital evidence management, reporting, and real-time situational awareness.\n\nImportantly, Axon has added a number of artificial intelligence features to its software products, such as automatic transcription and redaction of video evidence, as well as automated license plate reading. Its latest AI product, Draft One, uses body camera recordings to draft off police reports. Draft One achieved a $100 million revenue pipeline faster than any product in company history.\n\nAxon reported solid financial results in the third quarter. Revenue increased 32% to $544 million on strong sales growth in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software. Meanwhile, non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) earnings increased 19% to $1.45 per diluted share. The company also raised its full-year outlook, such that revenue is projected to increase 32% in 2024. Axon is well positioned to maintain its growth trajectory.\n\nThe company is the market leader in Tasers, body cameras, and digital evidence management software, and it has momentum in drones and robotics. CEO Rick Smith recently said, \"We are positioning ourselves as the indisputable leader in delivering the power of AI in practical, usable applications.\" Yet Axon has captured less than 3% of its $77 billion addressable market, leaving a long runway for growth.\n\nUnfortunately, valuation is somewhat concerning. Wall Street expects the company's earnings to increase at 22% annually through 2025. That estimate makes the current multiple of 120 times adjusted earnings look very expensive. Having said that, Axon reported earnings above the consensus in the last 12 quarters, and it beat the consensus by an average of 34% in the last six quarters.\n\nIf that pattern continues, the stock may appear reasonably valued in hindsight. So, risk-tolerant investors with a time horizon of at least three to five years should consider buying a very small position today.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The high valuation relative to expected earnings growth also raises concerns. These factors suggest a potential price decrease. However, Apple is a strong company with a loyal customer base and a history of innovation. The 'Double Down' recommendation from Motley Fool, despite being a general advertisement, could also influence some investors positively. Considering these opposing forces, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's inherent strength."

These factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand, existing services business, and projected 9% earnings growth offer some counterbalance.  The article's conclusion to \"avoid this stock\" strongly leans towards a negative outlook.  The information about Axon Enterprise is largely irrelevant to Apple's stock price movement, except insofar as it highlights Cohen's shift in investment strategy away from Apple.

Additionally, the absence of a strong iPhone upgrade cycle and high valuation metrics further support a bearish sentiment.

Steven Cohen's sale of his stake remains a significant negative signal. While Apple is a strong company, the immediate headwinds appear to outweigh any potential positive catalysts. The 'Double Down' advertisement is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment given the specific issues highlighted in the news article.

The significant decline in iPhone sales in China, the potential loss of substantial services revenue, the lackluster response to AI features, and the high P/E ratio all point towards a potential price decline.  Steven Cohen's sale of his entire stake reinforces this negative sentiment. Although the Motley Fool's 'Double Down' recommendation is mentioned, it's presented as an advertisement and doesn't significantly alter the overall negative picture painted by the news.  The previous predictions also largely agree on a higher probability of a price fall. Considering all these factors, I assign a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise."

Additionally, the stock's high valuation (P/E ratio of 33) and recent price increase driven by multiple expansion rather than earnings growth further support a bearish outlook.

Additionally, Steven Cohen's sale of his entire stake in Apple and purchase of Axon Enterprise suggests a lack of confidence in Apple's future performance. The current valuation of Apple at 33 times earnings appears expensive relative to its expected 9% earnings growth. While Apple has a strong brand and loyal customer base, the weight of these negative factors suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline. In contrast, Axon Enterprise, which Cohen bought into, shows strong growth potential and a leadership position in public safety products with AI features, but this information is more relevant to Axon's stock price than Apple's."

The sale of Apple stock by Steven Cohen, a highly successful hedge fund manager, further reinforces the negative sentiment. While Apple possesses a strong brand and loyal customer base, the immediate headwinds are substantial. The consensus among previous predictions also leans heavily towards a price decline. The 'Double Down' recommendation is presented as an advertisement and is unlikely to significantly impact investor sentiment given the weight of the negative news.  The consistent downward trend in probability of price rise across multiple prediction rounds further strengthens the bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is significantly higher than a price rise."

        "headline": "Mag 7 Earnings On Deck: A Closer Look",
        "content": "This week takes us into the heart of the Q4 earnings season, with more than 300 companies reporting results, including four Magnificent 7 members and 96 other S&P 500 members. We have Tesla TSLA, Microsoft MSFT, and Meta Platform META on Wednesday, January 29th, and Apple AAPL on Thursday, January 30th.\n\nApple shares have struggled lately, with the stock lagging behind the Mag 7 group and the broader market. The stock hit the 52-week high around Christmas and has since lost about 15% of its value on persistent worries about China and its AI strategy. The chart below shows the one-year performance of Apple, Microsoft, Meta, and Tesla relative to the S&P 500 index.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTesla shares have truly been on a tear since the last quarterly release on October 23rd, with the stock up more than +85% since the day before that release. Market participants appear convinced that Tesla\u2019s competitive challenges are behind it. We will see if this Wednesday\u2019s quarterly release validates this view.\n\nThe very positive sentiment on Tesla contrasts the dour views on Apple where some of the more bearish analysts are projecting a guidance cut. While estimates for the December quarter have been stable lately, estimates for the current and following fiscal years have been under pressure. The current Zacks Consensus EPS for fiscal year 2025 (ends in September) for Apple of $7.40 is down from $7.43 a week ago and $7.49 three months back.\n\nApple bulls see this all-around downbeat sentiment as overdone. While they acknowledge the China headwinds, they believe that the issue is manageable for the company and expect Apple to announce a local AI partner in the next few months. Baidu appears to be the front-line candidate, but analysts also mention Tencent and TikTok parent ByteDance as in the running.\n\nThe table below shows net margins for the group, with Tesla\u2019s 2024 Q4 net margins of 7.4% only modestly down from 7.9% in the year-earlier period, while Apple\u2019s margins are expected to be modestly up from the year-earlier period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnlike Tesla and Apple, the issue with Microsoft is the capex overhang, with the market concerned about the company\u2019s heavy investments in AI infrastructure without a tangible monetization plan.\n\nThe capex question isn\u2019t restricted to Microsoft alone, as Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta also face the same issue. Of these four, the problem is particularly central for Alphabet as many in the market see AI as potentially risking the company\u2019s search monopoly. Alphabet did a good job in its last earnings release on that front, but this will likely remain an ongoing issue in the Google story.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs you can see, the group is expected to bring in +20.9% more earnings in Q4 relative to the same period last year on +12.2% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAs we all know by now, the group\u2019s phenomenal boost in 2021 partly reflected pulled forward demand from future periods that got adjusted mostly in 2022. The group got back into \u2018regular/normal\u2019 growth mode in 2023, and the trend is expected to continue this year and beyond.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 24th, we have seen Q4 results from 78 S&P 500 members, or 15.6% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +17.4% from the same period last year on +6.2% higher revenues, with 83.3% beating EPS estimates and 66.7% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFor the Finance sector, we now have 45.5% of the sector\u2019s market capitalization in the S&P 500 index. Total earnings for these Finance sector companies are up +27.5% from the same period last year on +10.9% higher revenues, with all the companies beating EPS estimates (100%) and 80% surpassing revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 results from these Finance sector companies in a historical context. The first set of charts shows how the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these Finance companies compare to other recent periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHere is how the Q4 EPS and revenue beat percentages for these companies compare to other recent periodsZacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 100 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Boeing, GM, Starbucks, IBM, Southwest Airlines, Comcast, International Paper, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players.\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 35% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding contributions from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.7% on +3.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based. All 16 Zacks sectors are expected to enjoy positive earnings growth in 2025, with 8 of the 16 Zacks sectors expected to achieve double-digit earnings growth.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Earnings Picture Remains Strong: A Closer Look\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Apple's expected modest margin improvement is a positive factor.  Considering the conflicting signals and the previous predictions which range from 0.35 to 0.55 probability of a price rise, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall due to the weight of the negative factors (underperformance, China concerns, potential guidance cut). However, the potential for a positive surprise related to AI partnerships keeps the probability of a rise significant.

Big Tech earnings, including Apple's, are expected to focus on AI, which could be a positive catalyst if Apple demonstrates strong AI initiatives. However, the overall market sentiment towards tech earnings will play a significant role. The Fed's interest rate decision is a broader macroeconomic factor. A dovish stance (rate cuts or signals of future cuts) is generally positive for stocks, while a hawkish stance (rate hikes or signals of future hikes) is generally negative. Without specific details on Apple's expected earnings or the anticipated Fed decision, it's difficult to give a precise probability. I'm assuming a slightly positive outlook due to the potential for positive AI news and the market's general anticipation of a less hawkish Fed. However, earnings are always a risk, and a negative surprise could easily send the stock down."

Strong AI-related announcements could boost the stock price, while disappointing results could lead to a decline. The Federal Reserve's interest rate decision is also a significant factor. A rate hike could negatively impact the overall market and Apple's stock price, while a pause or smaller increase might be viewed more favorably.  The overall impact is uncertain, with both positive and negative factors at play.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned reflecting this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise given Apple's generally strong performance and the potential for positive AI news."

However, any disappointment in earnings or guidance could lead to a decline. The Fed's rate decision adds macroeconomic uncertainty; a hawkish stance could pressure tech stocks, while a dovish stance might boost them.

However, historically, Apple's stock price has been sensitive to earnings reports and interest rate decisions. Assuming that the earnings report is neutral to positive and the interest rate decision does not have a significant negative impact, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

A hawkish stance could negatively impact tech stocks, while a dovish stance could provide a boost. Given the consensus from previous rounds and the inherent uncertainty surrounding both earnings and the Fed's decision, I will maintain a similar probability distribution, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's generally strong performance and the potential for positive AI news.

It could simply be a portfolio rebalancing strategy. The fact that he's investing in a high-growth AI stock suggests a shift towards potentially higher-return opportunities. However, the market might react negatively to the news of Cohen selling Apple stock, even if temporarily. The impact is likely to be muted because Apple is a large, well-established company with diverse ownership. The 'little-known AI stock' is not relevant to the analysis of Apple's stock price movement. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so."

While Cohen's investment decisions are often followed closely by market participants, a single sale doesn't necessarily predict future price movements.  Cohen's rationale for selling is unknown; it could be due to portfolio rebalancing, profit-taking, or a change in his outlook on Apple's future prospects.  However, the fact that the news focuses on his purchase of another AI stock, rather than any negative news about Apple itself, suggests a limited impact on Apple's stock price.  The market is likely already pricing in much of the information about Apple's performance and future prospects. Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) solely due to this news is low.  A slight downward pressure is possible due to the news of a large investor selling, but this effect is likely to be temporary and minor."

While the sale by a prominent investor could be interpreted negatively, the lack of specific negative news about Apple itself suggests the impact will be minimal.  Most models predict a slightly higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the potential for negative sentiment from the sale. However, the consensus leans towards a relatively small change in either direction.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with most clustering around a 0.4 probability of a rise and a 0.6 probability of a fall.  Considering the overall sentiment and the fact that Apple is a large, established company, a significant price movement is unlikely.  I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly to reflect the consensus, but acknowledging the potential for a small negative reaction."

However, the news could trigger some profit-taking or hesitation among investors who were considering buying.  The probability of a price fall is therefore higher than a price rise, but the magnitude of the change is likely to be relatively small given Apple's overall market position and the fact that it's just one analyst's opinion.

Combining this historical data with the current positive market sentiment, we can reasonably estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising."

        "headline": "Is Apple (AAPL) Among the Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 15 Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years.\n\n2024 was a stellar year for the US markets, driven by a strong performance in the technology sector. The broader market expanded by more than 23% during the year, marking two consecutive years of over 20% growth\u2014something that had not happened in nearly three decades.\n\nREAD ALSO: 10 Best Single Digit Stocks To Buy Now and 10 Under-the-Radar Stocks with Massive Upside for 2025.\n\nThe stock market benefited from a resilient economy that avoided recession, declining interest rates, and waning inflation. Analysts are projecting continued growth in 2025 amid strong economic data and optimism about a business-friendly Trump administration returning to power.\n\nIn a note on December 30, Wedbush Securities analyst, Dan Ives, wrote that he expects a 25% surge in tech stocks as the new government focuses on slashing unnecessary regulations. On the other hand, Todd Rosenbluth, the head of research at VettaFi, anticipates that ETFs specializing in small-caps will make gains as investors broaden their market exposure with interest rates dropping.\n\nWhile the general outlook for 2025 is encouraging, analysts are also cautious about the potential downsides of the new administration\u2019s promised tariffs. Following his election victory, Trump has vowed to impose steep tariffs on imports from Canada, China, and Mexico, which could increase manufacturers\u2019 costs. Ongoing geopolitical tensions in different parts of the world could also hurt the stock market.\n\nCan ChatGPT predict the stock market?\n\nA growing number of investors are turning to ChatGPT for stock suggestions. According to a 2023 survey, around 53% of the Millenials and 50% of Generation Z respondents had used the AI chatbot for investing advice. In contrast, older Americans were skeptical of the recommendations, with only 25% of the Baby Boomers saying they had used ChatGPT to buy stocks.\n\nWhile most financial analysts question the reliability of ChatGPT for providing accurate and up-to-date information, Alejandro Lopez-Lira, a finance professor at the University of Florida, says that the chatbot may be able to predict stock movements. He used the platform to parse negative and positive headlines for stocks and predict returns for the following day. Lopez-Lira was surprised to find how good the results were.\n\nWhether or not tools like ChatGPT are effective in recommending stocks and predicting their trajectory remains a debate. However, they can be useful for investors researching the companies they want to invest in or when looking up definitions of financial terms they are unfamiliar with.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe prompted ChatGPT to predict 15 stocks that could make investors wealthy in 10 years and cite the reasons behind its analysis. The stocks are ranked in this article in the same order as provided by ChatGPT. The platform said it based its rankings on several factors, including market dominance, revenue and earnings growth, innovation, and industry growth potential.\n\nFor perspective, we have also shared the hedge fund sentiment toward each stock, based on Insider Monkey\u2019s database of over 900 prominent hedge funds as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among The Stocks ChatGPT Predicts Could Make You Wealthy in 10 Years?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading American technology company known for its consumer electronics, software, and other related products. Its premium line of products, which includes the iPhone, iPad, Mac computers, and a range of other accessories, has earned Apple widespread acclaim and customer loyalty.\n\nOn October 31, the company announced financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, beating Wall Street expectations for both revenue and earnings. It posted a quarterly revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year-over-year. The iPhone, which accounts for nearly half of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\u2019s overall revenue, registered a 6% growth in revenue.\n\nThe company\u2019s newest iPhone device, launched on September 20, gave Apple only a week of sales ahead of the earnings call. Despite that, the tech giant had a record business performance during the month, driving nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow. This allowed the company to return over $29 billion to shareholders for Q4 in dividends and repurchases.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence in the newly launched iPhone 16 has renewed investor confidence. Mar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q2 2024 investor letter:\n\nInvestors were reminded of the strength of the Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into Apple\u2019s 1.2 billion iPhone installed base. Apple plans to integrate generative AI features into its iOS 18, which will be broadly released in the fall with the iPhone 16. We believe Apple should benefit from generative AI as it will spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth ranging between high-single-digits and low-double-digits over our investment horizon.\n\nWall Street analysts are bullish on the stock with a consensus Buy rating and average share price upside potential of 8%.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of stocks ChatGPT predicts could make you wealthy in 10 years. While we acknowledge the potential of technology companies, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The consensus among the previous predictions consistently points towards a higher probability of a stock price fall (averaging around 0.75), with little deviation across different models.  Therefore, I am aligning with the consensus and assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall."
