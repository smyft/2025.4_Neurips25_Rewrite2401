        "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. The +25.6% earnings growth comprises actual results from the four group members that have reported and estimates for Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia (that haven\u2019t reported yet).Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below that shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.2% from the same period last year on +10.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks in the fore front of the rising estimates trend. The +16.9% earnings growth expected for the sector for 2025 at present is up from the +15.8% growth expected three months back.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 31st, we have seen Q4 results from 179 S&P 500 members, or 35.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues, with 80.4% beating EPS estimates and 67% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 132 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Pfizer, Pepsi, Ford, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players (Amazon and Alphabet).\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 63% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.6% on +4.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based.

It acknowledges Apple's better-than-feared earnings, but also highlights China as a major risk due to slowing iPhone demand and increased competition from local Chinese companies. The potential for tariffs is also a significant concern for Apple. While the overall tech sector and Mag 7 earnings show positive growth, the specific challenges faced by Apple in China, its AI struggles, and tariff risks outweigh the general positive trends. This suggests a higher likelihood of a price decrease in accordance with negative press."

While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations, the report highlights concerns about weakening iPhone demand in China and intensifying competition.  The positive market reaction to Apple's results was attributed more to relief over better-than-feared numbers, rather than strong underlying performance.  The article also emphasizes the uncertainty around the AI investments of other tech giants, which indirectly suggests Apple's own AI struggles are a significant headwind.  The overall positive sentiment regarding the tech sector is somewhat tempered by the China risk specific to Apple. Based on this, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the fall isn't predicted to be drastic."

Concerns regarding China and AI are balanced against decent earnings and positive market reception. The current news lacks any significantly new information that would drastically shift this balance. The fact that other models have not converged on a strong directional bias, even after a first round of analysis, reinforces the perception of uncertainty. Given this, I will slightly adjust the probabilities, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to existing concerns, but acknowledging that the company isn't facing any immediate crisis. Also note that lower range of predictions (0.35) exists in previous round which indicates a considerable down side for the stock price."

The AI struggles and potential for tariffs further compound these challenges.

Since there isn't substantial positive news to counter these ongoing concerns, I will adjust the probabilities to reflect a slightly more pronounced likelihood of a stock price fall.

(AAPL). However, the article also suggests that Wall Street's concerns might be overblown. Given Apple's diversified business model, strong brand, and indirect exposure to the specific AI model vulnerability, the immediate impact is likely neutral to slightly positive.

While I recognize that past performance is not a guarantee of future results, there doesn't seem to be any new information that would shift the balance towards a more positive prediction.

The rising inflation, as measured by the PCE index, is another bearish factor, potentially impacting consumer spending, and further suggesting downward pressure. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and overall demand are likely mitigating these negative factors to some extent. Considering the consensus from previous models (leaning heavily towards a price fall) and the dominating negative factors in the news, I've adjusted my prediction slightly downwards compared to some of the initial predictions, reflecting the overall negative market context and Apple's vulnerability to broader economic headwinds.

The models' predictions show a slight upward revision from round to round despite the limited rollout, suggesting a more positive market reaction than initially expected.  However, the lack of specifics regarding sales figures and the extent of the limited rollout prevents a strong bullish prediction.

        "headline": "Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Although Apple is still pursuing future AR glasses and other projects, the failure of N107 demonstrates difficulty in delivering a successful consumer-oriented AR product, impacting their innovation narrative and potentially investor confidence.  However, this is not a catastrophic event for Apple, a huge and diversified company; the stock price reaction is likely to be muted compared to a smaller, more specialized company facing similar setbacks. The existing positive sentiment around Apple's other products and strong financial position will likely limit the downside potential. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but it is likely a modest one."

The cancellation of a single project, while disappointing, is unlikely to cause a significant stock plunge.  The fact that Apple is continuing to work on AR technology and other projects mitigates the negative impact.

This decision, compounded by previous failures, raises investor concerns about Apple's ability to maintain leadership in new technology initiatives and compound competitive pressure from companies like Meta. The general sentiment across various analyses indicates a belief that while Apple retains a strong market position and diversified revenue streams, the immediate reaction to this news is more likely to be negative, leading to a higher estimated probability of stock price decline. Consequently, I suggest a probability of 0.3 for stock price rise and 0.7 for stock price fall."

The consistent prediction of a higher probability of a price fall across multiple models in previous rounds highlights a prevailing negative sentiment. This reflects ongoing challenges with the Vision Pro's slow adoption rate and the setbacks faced by Apple in the AR/VR market. However, Apple's strong financial position, diversified revenue streams, and continued work on other AR technologies mitigate the negative impact.  The cancellation of a single project, while demonstrating difficulties in the AR space and potentially impacting investor confidence in Apple's innovation capability, is unlikely to cause a major stock plunge.  The market may have already partially priced in this risk, considering the previous struggles with the Vision Pro and the history of Apple cancelling projects.

This convergence suggests a degree of confidence in the positive correlation between the overall tech sector performance and Apple's stock price, despite the limited information.  I am considering the history of predictions and the slight downward trend in probabilities which shows a slight decrease in certainty over time due to the lack of specific news about Apple.

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

This suggests that while there are concerns about sales, particularly with potential mismatches in product rollouts, Apple's position in leveraging AI spending from other Big Tech companies could be beneficial. Overall, the cautious tone may lead to a slight increase in selling pressure, but the less vulnerable status may not lead to major declines."

On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollout could negatively impact iPhone sales, leading analyst Tom Forte to maintain a \"Hold\" rating and express uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. However, the article also highlights Apple's less vulnerable position in the AI race due to its hybrid capital expenditure model, allowing it to leverage the investments of other Big Tech players while spending less itself. This could be seen as a positive factor, mitigating the threat from rising AI companies. The downgraded ratings earlier in the week might put extra pressure on Apple.

        "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

This typically suggests a stable economic outlook, which is generally positive for large corporations like Apple. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of Apple\u2019s stock price rising as investor sentiment may be positively affected by the overall market trend.

This suggests that the market is reacting positively to the news, likely because it reduces concerns about further aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. Since Apple is a major company in the US equity indexes, a general positive sentiment in the market will likely boost its stock price. Also, since I'm blocked from accessing premium content, I am assuming that the rest of the article simply provides data backing the headline, such as the actual inflation data. Therefore, my probabilities will be skewed towards the stock price rising."

This is generally positive news for the stock market as it suggests that inflation may be under control, reducing the likelihood of further aggressive interest rate hikes by the Fed.  Since Apple is a major component of the US equity indexes, it's likely to be positively influenced by this overall market trend. However, without access to the full news article, it's impossible to determine if there's any specific news pertaining to Apple itself that might influence its price independently.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher, but a significant portion of uncertainty remains due to the limited news information. I'm assigning a higher probability to a price rise due to the positive market-wide sentiment indicated by the headline, but acknowledging that unforeseen factors could impact the price negatively."

As Apple is a significant component of US indexes, it is likely to benefit from this overall positive market sentiment. Previous predictions have been consistently high for stock price rises, indicating a strong consensus about favorable outcomes.

The EU's clarification that the fines aren't a tax aims to de-escalate the situation, and the news lacks any new information about specific investigations or penalties targeting Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning slightly towards a price drop due to general regulatory uncertainty and others predicting a neutral impact. Considering the lack of direct negative impact on Apple, and the overall mixed sentiment previously expressed, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of no significant movement.  However, the inherent uncertainty surrounding regulatory pressures for large tech companies warrants accounting for a slight possibility of both price increase and decrease. I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect this relatively neutral outlook compared to the initial predictions, which heavily leaned toward a fall in multiple instances."

Most models indicate a mixed but slightly negative sentiment, reflecting concerns over regulatory pressures. However, the absence of any new fines or investigations could help mitigate the overall impact. Thus, the probabilities of both rising and falling stock prices are nearly balanced, but with a slightly higher inclination towards a fall due to the general sentiment surrounding increased scrutiny."

This reiterates existing regulatory pressure on Big Tech, including potential implications for Apple. While there's no specific new negative development directly targeting Apple, the recurring theme of regulatory scrutiny usually creates investor uncertainty. Previous predictions have fluctuated but generally lean towards a slightly negative outlook reflecting the perceived regulatory risk. However, some correction towards neutral position is observed as the news does not have any direct impact on the financials or outlook of Apple.

Probabilities initially ranged from 0.65 to 0.8, trending upwards to 0.78-0.87 in subsequent rounds. This consistent upward revision reflects a strengthening belief in a positive market reaction.  While acknowledging inherent market volatility and the potential for unforeseen negative factors in the full report (which could possibly lower the price), the weight of evidence strongly favors a price increase.  Therefore, I'm assigning a high probability to a price rise, slightly higher than the average of the previous rounds to account for the increasing consensus."

While the overall positive sentiment towards AI might buoy tech stocks, the lack of direct connection and Apple's current performance suggest cautious optimism.

While the main focus is on the increasing integration of AI in cloud-based solutions and its impact on the healthcare industry, this is more relevant to companies like PracticeSuite, Google Cloud, and ServiceNow. The article mentions Apple finished down slightly (-0.7%) despite announcing a recent dividend and reporting earnings/revenue growth a day prior. This suggests the immediate impact of the broader cloud AI news on Apple is neutral to slightly negative, primarily due to ServiceNow's lagging performance and the overall AI discussions perhaps overshadowing Apple's individual positive announcements. However, the emphasis on AI overall in stocks such as Super Micro Computer and Alphabet is a positive, implying a generally positive market response to AI stocks. In this case the neutral to negative sentiment is weighed up against the positive sentiment of recent news to indicate a lower chance of a rise and slight fall in price. There is not significant news of Apple embracing AI in order for the company to benefit from the current stock market up turn for AI."

The article itself does not directly link Apple's recent activities to advancements in cloud AI or healthcare AI. The positive movements in other AI-related stocks (e.g., Alphabet) do not directly impact Apple's stock price probability in this specific context. Given the lack of direct positive news regarding Apple and its AI initiatives and its already reported positive earnings, the probability of a stock price rise is considered low, while the probability of a fall is also low, given the already small daily decline and positive recent earnings. The most likely outcome is sideways movement with neutral impact from this news."

                    "reasoning": "The financial news primarily discusses advancements in AI within the cloud computing sector, particularly in healthcare, which has minimal direct relevance to Apple Inc. (AAPL). Although Apple recently announced increased earnings, revenue, and a cash dividend, the stock has shown a consistent slight decline (-0.7%), indicating it faces market pressures. The overall positive sentiment around AI and cloud technologies might have an indirect positive effect on tech stocks. However, without any significant direct news impacting Apple, any changes in stock price are likely to be minimal or influenced by broader market trends."

        "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This integration could be a positive catalyst. However, the article mentions that the recent iPhone 16 launch, despite AI features, did not result in a significant sales boost, raising concerns about immediate financial benefits. The article also contains a statement that there are AI stocks that are \"more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings... cheapest AI stock,\" suggesting there may be better opportunities in the AI sector than AAPL. Given the mixed signals and Apple's comparatively lower ranking (6th) among Coatue's AI stocks, the probability of a price rise and fall is relatively balanced, however with more positive indicators for continued growth in the short-term. Therefore, I'm estimating a slightly higher probability for a rise."

While Apple reported record revenue, the impact of its newly launched AI features (Apple Intelligence) on sales wasn't significantly apparent in iPhone 16 sales.  The article even suggests other AI stocks offer potentially higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  This mixed message suggests that while the broader AI market optimism could support AAPL's price, the specific impact of Apple's AI initiatives remains uncertain in the short term. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate, while the probability of a fall is relatively low, given Apple's overall strong financial performance and position in the market.

Apple's record revenue (6% YoY) further strengthens the positive outlook. However, a key concern is the muted sales impact of AI features on the iPhone 16, which tempers immediate optimism. Previous rounds of predictions reflect this mixed sentiment, generally leaning towards a slightly higher probability of price rise but acknowledging potential downsides. Considering the consensus from previous rounds, the ongoing positive AI narrative, and Apple's financial performance, the probability of a price rise remains above 0.5, but the lack of immediate AI-driven sales boost warrants a slightly more conservative estimate than the highest predictions from the previous rounds. Additionally, others are emphasizing on that there are other more promissing AI stocks, which also indicates the stock price will not increase dramatically."

For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates. The increase comes off the back of sales of its heart failure drug, Entresto, and multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEntrestro, which will lose its patent protection later this year, saw quarterly revenues jump by a third to $2.2bn.\n\nFor Q4, net income rose 26% to $3.9bn. This surpassed analyst consensus of $3.6bn, Reuters reported.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nOil major Shell (SHEL.L) was trading 0.8% higher in the morning on Friday, building on gains from the week following its quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe company reported a sharp fall in profits in the fourth quarter but declared another $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) share buyback.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $3.66bn in the fourth quarter were down 39% on the $6bn Shell (SHEL.L) posted in the third quarter, according to its latest results. For the year, adjusted earnings were down 16% to $23.7bn, compared to $28.3bn in 2023.\n\nShell said income attributable to shareholders had fallen 78% to $928m in the fourth quarter, down from $4.2bn in previous quarter.\n\nHowever, this figure was higher than the $474m it reported in the same period last year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L) was the top riser in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Friday, up more than 14% after the opening bell following news it had responded to activist investor calls to split up its business. The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure.

The initial premarket surge of 3.4% indicates positive investor sentiment driven by better-than-expected quarterly results (sales +4%, net income +7%, services +14%). This momentum is a strong indicator of a likely rise. However, there are cautionary notes. Revenue from China declined significantly (-11%), and analysts pointed out the slow and limited rollout of Apple Intelligence, particularly its lack of non-English language support. This raises concerns about wider adoption and could limit future gains. The year-to-date performance is negative (-2.6%), which suggests existing pressures. Taking both positive and negative aspects, and the fact that an analyst has predicted growth, I believe a rise is slightly more probable than a fall, but there is still a significant chance of the price dropping given the limitations that have been pointed out. I've assigned slightly higher probability to a rise."

Analyst commentary expresses mixed sentiment; one analyst highlights the positive results, while another points to the potential for this restrained AI strategy to hinder consumer upgrades and therefore future growth.  The year-to-date decline of 2.6% reflects broader tech sector anxieties related to Chinese AI competition.  Considering the positive earnings report and premarket jump, the probability of a price rise is higher.

        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The article highlights Apple's \"strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends\" and the potential erosion of its premium market positioning. Increased competition and geopolitical factors are mentioned as additional risks. Though positive overall, the 'Double Down' promotional piece at the end is more marketing.

Apple's CEO Tim Cook's comments, describing DeepSeek as 'probably a good thing' and emphasizing Apple's 'prudent' approach to capital spending, likely reassure investors and suggest that the company sees opportunities rather than threats. This, combined with the broader market recovery in tech stocks, supports a higher probability of AAPL's stock price rising.

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments",

While the overall market is influenced by the upcoming inflation data (PCE price index), Apple's specific positive forecast acts as a strong independent driver. Potential risks include a surprisingly high inflation print that could negatively impact the overall market and override company-specific news. However, given Apple's strong position and positive outlook, the probability of a rise is significantly higher than a fall. This positive sentiment is slightly tapered due to broader market factors like potential tariffs and broader economic uncertainty."

Several articles highlight the competitive threat posed by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has caused broader market concerns and even a tech stock sell-off, initially a negative signal. However, Nvidia has suggested that DeepSeek will need more of Nvidia's chips, suggesting that DeepSeek's advancement is real but not detrimental to chip leaders. Meta's success indicates market appetite for AI spends. Apple is gearing up to release its fiscal first quarter results. These earnings generate uncertainty until actually released. Considering the rise of AI development (as seen with Deepseek, Meta, and others), the possibility of positive announcements from Apple is present, as they have likely built some AI strategies of their own. Given the information available, a slightly higher chance of a positive (or no) movement is indicated by the recent events. However, the market is uncertain and dependent on what actually turns out for Apple. Therefore, a slight increase is expected, if anything."

However, other predictions saw potential for positive Apple earnings. Considering these factors and given the anticipation of earnings, there's inherent uncertainty that slightly favors a fall, though a very negative prediction is not assured.

The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business. The future performance of Apple will be closely tracked by market analysts regarding its AI developments.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The positive outlook for the next quarter, particularly the prediction of single-digit to mid-single-digit sales growth, is encouraging.

Although concerns exist about Apple's cautious approach to AI investments compared to competitors, the current news focuses on the exceeding financial performance and positive future projections. The initial market reaction (3.5% jump) suggests a strong positive sentiment.  However, a slight underperformance in iPhone sales and uncertainty about future AI investments introduce some risk.

The consistent trend across multiple AI model predictions in previous rounds strongly supports a higher probability of a price rise. The initial market reaction reinforces this positive sentiment. While the iPhone sales miss presents some downside risk, the overall positive factors significantly outweigh it.

        "content": "Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

This suggests demand momentum for the iPhone, despite a slight drop in iPhone sales and misses in the company's performance in Greater China. The overall reaction in premarket trading is positive, showing a rebound. Additionally, the mixed nature of the earnings report, with positive signs in services, the introduction of Apple Intelligence, and a cautious approach to AI investing, contributes to speculations about future growth. However, concerns regarding competition and regional sales particularly in China may temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive sales outlook and management's optimism lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling."

                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the overall sales outlook is positive and exceeded expectations, driven by iPhone demand momentum, iPhone sales actually fell short of estimates, particularly in China. The growth in the services unit is a positive sign. The impact of Apple Intelligence is noted as beneficial but not yet fully realized due to limited availability. Analysts describe the results as 'mixed', with China concerns overshadowing positive areas. The initial pre-market reaction was a dip, followed by a rebound, suggesting investor uncertainty. Also a detail not to ignore, market turmoil affected other big tech companies, but Apple was relatively insulated. Overall, the positive outlook and Apple Intelligence are the main drivers for potential upside, while weak iPhone sales and China performance are the main downside risks, the market gives more importance to the overall sales outlook. Considering these factors, i think investors will focus more on the positive outlook than on some negative details that are affecting it."

While overall revenue and EPS beat expectations, iPhone sales slightly missed estimates, and sales in Greater China were significantly below projections.  However, the positive outlook for Q2 sales growth, exceeding analyst expectations, and the positive impact of Apple Intelligence (AI features) on iPhone sales are key factors influencing the prediction.  The cautious approach to AI also seems to have shielded Apple from the recent Big Tech downturn. The slightly negative aspects (missed iPhone sales targets and weak China performance) are outweighed by the positive Q2 guidance and the perceived success of Apple Intelligence.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher."

The strength of the services sector is a positive, and Apple Intelligence is showing promise, but is not yet widely available.  The consensus among previous models is a higher probability of a price rise (averaging around 0.675), stemming from the positive sales outlook being viewed as more impactful than the mixed Q1 results.  However, the significant shortfall in China sales is a concern that could negatively impact investor confidence.  Considering both positive and negative aspects, and the previous model predictions, a slightly more conservative estimate than the average of previous models is warranted. The pre-market rebound from an initial dip suggests investor reaction is currently positive but uncertain."

Despite the challenges in China and the slight dip in iPhone sales, the positive elements are likely to outweigh the negatives, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising."

        "headline": "Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

The upcoming inflation data could also impact the overall market, and thus Apple's stock price, but it's difficult to predict its specific effect on Apple. Considering these factors, a slight increase in stock price is slightly more likely than a decrease."

Apple's cautious approach to AI investments has also insulated its stock from recent market volatility affecting other Big Tech stocks. However, external uncertainties, particularly Trump's fresh tariff threats, introduce concerns that could negatively affect stock performance by potentially fueling inflation and market volatility. The upcoming PCE data release could also impact the stock price. Considering the balance of these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which generally indicate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising."

The consensus among previous model predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price increase (around 0.6), reflecting the balance between positive company-specific news and negative macroeconomic uncertainties.  I've considered this consensus and adjusted my estimate to reflect the persistent threat of tariffs and potential inflation, while acknowledging Apple's relatively strong position within the current market conditions.  The previous models' predictions show a convergence towards a probability of around 0.6 for a price rise, and I've slightly adjusted this downwards to reflect the uncertainty surrounding Trump's policies and potential inflation, but maintain a cautiously optimistic outlook for Apple's stock price based on their relatively positive earnings report and guidance."

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

BofA's reiteration of a Buy rating suggests optimism despite lowered sales expectations. Overall, the positive association with Buffett and the company's strong revenue growth may support a higher likelihood of price stability or modest gains, but the potential for sales decline creates downward pressure. Thus, probabilities suggest a slightly higher chance of a stock price rise."

However, it also mentions that Greenlight Capital is concerned about the overall valuation of the market and has maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure.

However, there are concerns regarding lower iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges, as well as a cautious stance from other investors regarding overall market valuation. These counterbalancing factors suggest that while there is a positive inclination driven by Buffett's influence and Apple's strong fundamentals, prudent investors might still be cautious in the face of potential near-term challenges.

The previous predictions show a relatively stable range, reflecting this mixed sentiment and converging towards a slight upward bias. Considering the long-term bullish signal from Buffett's investment and the company's strong fundamentals (revenue growth, cash flow), a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned.

Operating Cash Flow: $29.9 billion. Installed Base: Over 2.35 billion active devices, an all-time high. Capital Return: Over $30 billion returned to shareholders, including $23.3 billion in share repurchases.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

However, a notable decline in Greater China revenue and a decrease in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue present challenges. Foreign exchange headwinds are also expected. The success of Apple Intelligence is a significant positive, but its unavailability in China is a concern. Furthermore, GuruFocus detected 3 warning signs which could indicate deeper underlying issues not captured in this single report. Considering both the positive and negative aspects, the positive earnings generally outweigh the negatives in the immediate term, leading to an estimation that there is a higher probability that the stock price will rise than fall.

The introduction of Apple Intelligence is showing promising results in boosting demand where it's available. Although the China market weakness and currency headwinds are notable negative factors, the overall strength of the report suggests these are manageable challenges. The high installed base provides a strong foundation for continued growth.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is higher than a price fall."

Record revenue and EPS are undeniably positive, driven by strong iPhone sales, growth in services, and expansion in emerging markets.  The record installed base also bodes well for future growth.  However, significant headwinds exist.  The decline in Greater China revenue (a major market) is concerning, especially given the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there and increased competition.  Decreased Wearables revenue and rising operating expenses also present challenges. The GuruFocus warning signs further add to the caution. While the overall financial performance is impressive, the negative factors are substantial enough to temper the immediate positive reaction. Considering previous model predictions which mostly favored a price rise (averaging around 0.72 probability of rise),  I'm adjusting slightly downward to account for the substantial negative aspects, particularly the China market performance and GuruFocus warnings.

Despite challenges such as declining revenue in Greater China and decreased wearables revenue, the overall positive financial performance and high customer loyalty suggest a favorable outlook. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has also positively impacted iPhone demand in available markets. Considering the consistency of previous predictions, which leaned towards a higher probability of stock price rise, and weighing the positive and negative factors, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably. The consistency in the previous predictions, which lean towards a higher probability of stock price rising, also supports this assessment. However, the GuruFocus warning signs and the challenges in specific segments introduce a margin for caution."

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

An analyst downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, further contributes to negative sentiment. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it's lagging behind in generative AI applications for consumers. The article, while including Apple in a list of AI stocks, ultimately favors other AI stocks for potentially higher returns. The inclusion of Apple second place is moderately offsetting, however, the analyst downgrade will most likely have a significantly negative effect. The discussion around the Stargate initiative has limited direct relevance to AAPL. Therefore, the overwhelmingly negative tone suggests a higher probability of the stock price declining."

The analyst also points to the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and a lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps.  The Stargate initiative, a large AI project unrelated to Apple's direct operations, is mentioned but has substantial uncertainty regarding funding, potentially impacting investor sentiment around the AI sector in general, but not directly impacting Apple's valuation.  The overall tone leans slightly negative given the specific concerns about Apple's performance and the analyst downgrade. While the news isn't overwhelmingly negative, the lack of significant positive news and the expressed concerns about Apple's AI strategy suggest a greater likelihood of a price decrease in the short term."

        "headline": "Apple Forecast Cheers Investors After Mixed Holiday Results",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

While the initial reaction was positive, with the stock climbing 3% in late trading after the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, a deeper dive reveals underlying concerns. The 4% revenue growth to $124.3 billion was helped by services revenue which beat analyst expectations. Profit also beat analyst expectations at $2.40 a share. However, there were specific weaknesses notably, the 11% drop in China revenue and the slightly below-expected iPhone sales suggests challenges in a key market and product segment. The company's attempt to catch up to its peers in AI is another potential hurdle, as well as potential new tariffs, while a new CFO may add uncertainty. On the positive side, Mac and iPad lineups performed better than expected. The forecast of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth is in line with expectations. Overall, while the immediate sentiment is positive due to the revenue forecast and some product categories exceeding expectations, the combination of China decline, AI competition, and potential tariffs suggest limited upside."

The solid performance of the services division, Mac, and iPad lineups provides a counterweight, and the company's plan for product refreshes, including a new iPhone SE and a thinner iPhone, could incentivize upgrades later in the year. Challenges in AI, competition, and potential tariffs remain long-term concerns, but the market's immediate reaction appears constructive.

The reassuring revenue guidance for Q2 (low-to-mid single-digit growth), aligning with analyst expectations, did soothe investor concerns and resulted in a 3% after-hours stock price increase.  However, long-term challenges remain: intense competition in China and the AI space, the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence, potential new tariffs, and EU regulatory scrutiny.  The consistent trend among previous model predictions leans towards a slightly higher probability of a price increase (around 0.63-0.65), but the magnitude of the underlying issues and uncertainty warrant caution. The positive market reaction is significant, but likely overstates the long-term outlook.

The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news."

This suggests a positive outlook for future revenue growth. Although Apple is a mature company, the ability to attract new customers and expand within its existing user base is a significant positive factor. However, the market's reaction might be muted due to the already high valuation of Apple's stock.  There are also external factors impacting stock prices not mentioned in this news that could affect the price whether favorably or negatively. Therefore, while the news is positive, the probability of a significant stock price increase is moderate, and the probability of a decrease or stagnation is relatively low. "

        "content": "Apple\u2019s iPhone sales fell in the all-important December quarter, a sign that its artificial-intelligence software has yet to kick off a new cycle of growth for its most valuable product. On Thursday, Apple reported that iPhone sales for the quarter were down nearly 1% from the prior year to $69.1 billion, a miss from the $70.7 billion analysts were projecting, according to FactSet.

Although total revenue increased, the miss on iPhone sales relative to analyst projections can create negative sentiment among investors, leading to potential downward pressure on the stock price. As a result, there is a greater likelihood of the stock price falling compared to rising, especially as investors are awaiting a payoff from AI initiatives that have yet to materialize."

While total revenue increased by almost 4%, the slight decrease in iPhone sales (a miss compared to analyst expectations) is a negative indicator as the iPhone is Apple's most important product. The fact that AI hasn't yet driven new iPhone sales is also a concern. Overall, the slightly negative news regarding the core product outweighs the positive revenue growth in terms of its potential immediate impact on investor sentiment. This is because the market is forward looking and concerns regarding iPhone sales tend to drive quicker reactions than total revenue growth."

The news highlights the market's anticipation of an AI-driven growth spurt that hasn't yet materialized.  Investors are likely to react negatively to the missed expectations in the short term, potentially causing a price drop. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the long-term prospects tied to AI development could provide support. The probability of a stock price fall is higher in the immediate aftermath of this news due to the missed iPhone sales targets; however, the long-term outlook is less certain and dependent on the future success of Apple's AI initiatives."

The consistent prediction from previous models of a higher probability of a price fall reflects the potential for negative market reaction.

The lack of a noticeable AI-driven boost further adds to the negative sentiment.  The consistent prediction across multiple models in previous rounds, showing a higher probability of a price fall, reinforces this negative outlook. While the overall revenue increase provides a small buffer, the market's focus on iPhone sales and the short-term nature of market reactions suggest that the negative news will likely outweigh the positive. The consensus among previous predictions, consistently leaning towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, strongly supports this assessment.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, though the possibility of a rise is not entirely ruled out due to the overall revenue increase and long-term potential of AI integration."

This perspective stems from the market's tendency to prioritize key product sector performance combined with the absence of noticeable AI-driven progress and takes into account that the continuous prediction around previous rounds indicates a stabilised expectation about the price movement. Taking the above factors into consideration while factoring in the general trend and stabilised state after multiple round of predictions I predict the probablities to be as follows"

EPS came in at $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.24% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.36, the EPS surprise was +1.69%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China: $18.51 billion compared to the $22.16 billion average estimate based on two analysts.

The iPhone, Apple's flagship product, saw a slight year-over-year decrease in revenue, failing to meet expectations, although this was slightly offset by strong growth in other product lines such as Mac and iPad.

While the small beats on revenue and EPS might offer some short-term support, the weight of negative factors suggests a higher likelihood of a price decline.  The consistent downward trend in previous prediction rounds further supports this conclusion."

However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales remains uncertain, as it could indicate weakening consumer demand or increased competition. Therefore, while the initial reaction is positive, there's a considerable risk of the stock price correcting if investors become more concerned about the iPhone sales trend.  The probability of a rise is higher due to the immediate positive market response, but the uncertainty introduced by the iPhone sales decline necessitates a significant probability of a fall as well."

However, the immediate market reaction (stock price increase in after-hours trading) suggests that the positive impact of exceeding earnings expectations currently outweighs the negative impact of declining iPhone sales.  Several previous models also show a similar trend, with probabilities favouring a price increase, although the degree of confidence varies.  Considering the short-term market response and the strength of the services segment, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price increase, but acknowledge the risk presented by the iPhone sales decline.

The decline in iPhone sales introduces some uncertainty, but the overall reaction seems to lean towards the positive, given the after-hours stock price increase.

Previous models consistently assigned a higher probability to price increase but acknowledged the iPhone sales concern. The overall sentiment remains slightly positive, and given the gradual increase in the predicted probability across round 0 and 1 by certain models, a further slight adjustment upwards is warranted, while still heavily accounting for the iPhone sales issue."

However, the decline in iPhone sales \u2013 a historically crucial revenue stream \u2013 introduces significant uncertainty. This decline raises concerns about future growth and potential softening consumer demand.  Analyzing the previous predictions, there's a consensus leaning towards a stock price rise, though the probability varies between 0.6 and 0.7.  The consistency of this positive outlook, coupled with the after-hours market response, informs my prediction. However, I've slightly lowered the probability of a rise to account for the substantial risk posed by the iPhone sales decline.  The weight of the earnings beat and positive market reaction are significant, but the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales is a crucial variable that could lead to a correction. My final prediction reflects a balance between these conflicting forces."

(AAPL) has beaten earnings expectations largely due to a rise in services revenues, though there was a noticeable decline in iPhone sales. Multiple previous predictions from various models suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising, primarily due to the positive earnings beat and initial market positivity as evidenced by the stock's rise during extended trading. Although the decline in iPhone sales introduces a level of uncertainty and could pose risks for long-term growth, the overwhelming sentiment so far points towards a positive reaction to the earnings report."

        "content": "From 2015 to 2021, Apple saw a three-year cycle for iPhone sales, with 2015, 2018 and 2021 being the high-water years. When questioned on the product cycle and the average life of products during Thursday's earnings call, Cook chose to focus on the opportunity ahead: \"I think it's different for different types of users,\" he said. \"And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the Covid period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company for more than one of the product categories.\"\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments",

While Cook emphasizes that there are opportunities ahead and that different user types might respond differently, the lack of a defined refresh cycle could create uncertainty among investors. As a result, there may be a higher chance that the stock price could be negatively affected by this news, although the overall strong brand loyalty and market position may mitigate drastic declines."

                    "reasoning": "The news headline suggests a potential slowdown in Apple's iPhone sales cycle, moving away from the historical three-year refresh pattern. Cook's vague response during the earnings call about product life cycles raises concerns about future sales growth. While he acknowledges past sales during COVID, framing it as a future 'opportunity' suggests uncertainty about maintaining that level of sales. The lack of a clear affirmation of a strong replacement cycle might disappoint investors accustomed to predictable growth. This may lead to a slight downward pressure on the stock. However, Cook's reference to future opportunities might inspire some confidence; so the negative probabilities are only slightly higher than the positive. Given Apple's financial strength and brand loyalty, a dramatic fall is unlikely."

However, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, downplayed this concern, attributing past high sales to the COVID-19 period and emphasizing future opportunities.  This suggests a degree of uncertainty. While the missing refresh cycle could negatively impact short-term sales figures, Cook's optimistic outlook and the continued strong presence of Apple products in the market suggest that the impact might be limited.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, but the uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for either outcome. The market may react cautiously, with a potential temporary dip followed by a recovery dependent on future announcements and actual sales figures. "

However, CEO Tim Cook's focus on the opportunities ahead, especially in other product categories, suggests potential for diversification and growth beyond iPhones. Investors might react negatively to the uncertainty around iPhone sales but could also see value in the company's broader product strategy. The mixed signals make the stock's direction uncertain, with a slight edge towards negative sentiment due to the prominence of iPhone sales in Apple's revenue."

However, during the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook shifted focus to the opportunities ahead, particularly highlighting the potential for growth in various product categories post-Covid. The tone seems cautiously optimistic rather than alarmingly negative. Given this, the market might initially react negatively to the headline but could stabilize or improve as investors digest Cook's comments on future opportunities.

This lack of clarity on the sales cycle could introduce uncertainty and potentially impact investor confidence. However, Cook's emphasis on opportunities, particularly those arising from the Covid period, might also be seen as a positive indicator for future growth. Given these mixed signals, the impact on the stock price is uncertain. The reasoning process involves weighing the potential negative impact of a disrupted sales cycle against the potential positive impact of new opportunities."

During the earnings call, CEO Tim Cook did not directly address the missing refresh cycle, instead focusing on the future opportunities for the company across multiple product categories, potentially addressing concerns related to the iPhone sales cycle. The ambiguity around the timing of product refreshes could initially impact investor confidence negatively. However, Cook\u2019s optimistic outlook regarding the long-term growth potential across various product categories might mitigate these negative sentiments. The lack of specific forward guidance regarding sales cycles and the general focus on broader future opportunities suggests a balanced market reaction."

While the historical three-year cycle could suggest potential slowdowns in sales growth, CEO Tim Cook's emphasis on future opportunities across various product categories and the acknowledgment of past sales success during the COVID-19 period offer a counterbalance to this concern. The overall sentiment from previous predictions leans slightly negative due to uncertainties in the iPhone product cycle. However, Cook's focus on diversification and growth potential indicates that investors may not react overwhelmingly negatively. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, reflecting uncertainty, but with significant potential for stabilization due to the broader opportunities highlighted by management."

While the lack of a clear answer might worry investors accustomed to predictable growth, Cook presenting opportunities may also instill some confidence. Considering the previous rounds of predictions show varied sentiments but leaning slightly toward a negative outlook (with some models initially predicting a higher chance of a fall, others balancing out), I'll adjust my prediction to be slightly more positive than the current average, with a focus on Cook's comments about opportunities. However, uncertainty still remains due to the missing refresh cycle, so I will not dramatically change the probability."

The lack of clear guidance on future iPhone sales cycles increases uncertainty, potentially leading to a cautious market reaction. However, Apple's overall financial strength and brand loyalty mitigate the risk of a significant drop. Considering the mixed signals, and the precedent set by previous predictions indicating a roughly even split between price rise and fall, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned due to the uncertainty surrounding the future iPhone sales cycle. This uncertainty, coupled with the lack of direct address to the issue by Apple's CEO, slightly favors a negative market sentiment in the short term."

The lack of clear guidance on future iPhone sales cycles increases uncertainty, potentially leading to a cautious market reaction. However, Apple's financial strength, brand loyalty, and diversified product portfolio mitigate the risk of a significant drop.  Considering the mixed signals, the slight negative bias in previous predictions, and the inherent concern raised by the headline's mention of a 'missing refresh cycle', a slightly higher probability for a stock price fall is assigned.

Cook's response, however, focuses on future opportunities and diversification, suggesting that Apple isn't overly concerned and expects to offset any potential shortfall.  The previous prediction rounds show a gradual shift towards a more balanced outlook, starting with a stronger lean towards a price drop and eventually converging around a roughly 50/50 chance.  The models are still largely uncertain.  While the missing refresh cycle is a legitimate concern,  Apple's overall financial health and brand strength limit the downside risk. The ambiguity and the history of the predictions suggest a high degree of uncertainty will likely remain in the short term, leading to sideways movement rather than a significant price swing in either direction. I am weighting the uncertainty more towards the negative due to the prominence of the iPhone in Apple's overall revenue and the lack of concrete reassurance from the CEO regarding the iPhone cycle."

Apple reported earnings per share of $2.41, and net income of $36.3 billion.\n\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cWe were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal.\u201d\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Apple was also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion.\n\nDespite being the company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter ever,\u201d Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nApple shares were up by more than 3% in after-hours trading after the company said on its earnings call it expects \u201clow to mid single digits\u201d growth on an annual basis for the March quarter. Analysts expected guidance of $95.6 billion for revenue, and $1.66 for earnings per share, according to FactSet\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 0.74% at the market close on Thursday, and are down by 5.1% so far this year.\n\nCook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call it will roll out more languages for Apple Intelligence in April, and that most customers are currently using artificial intelligence features such as Writing Tools and Image Playground.\n\nEarlier this month, Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform,\u201d citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first-quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nThe company rolled out the Apple Intelligence features in October, which \u201chas yet to gain traction with consumers,\u201d Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it was \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

While the company reported record overall earnings and met revenue expectations, it missed iPhone revenue estimates, a critical segment. The initial after-hours surge suggests investors reacted positively to the overall earnings and future growth guidance. However, the Jefferies downgrade citing weak future iPhone sales and the lack of traction for current AI features introduce a significant negative factor. The market's initial enthusiasm might cool down as investors further digest the iPhone miss and the potential impact of negative analyst sentiment. The provided detail that shares are down 0.74% at market close on Thursday and are down by 5.1% so far this year shows the stock has been performing weakly, making downward momentum potentially stronger. Weighing these factors, the positive aspects (record earnings and growth guidance) are somewhat offset by the iPhone revenue miss and negative analyst sentiment. Apple Intelligence is said to have yet to gain traction with consumers so the overall positive and negative factors are somewhat balanced, giving slightly more weight to the fall."

While the exceeding overall earnings initially pushed the stock price up in after-hours trading, the miss on iPhone sales and weaker-than-expected guidance are significant negative factors. Jefferies' prior downgrade and concerns about future iPhone sales further contribute to a bearish outlook. The positive news of record earnings is counterbalanced by the negative news of missed iPhone sales targets and conservative guidance, creating uncertainty.  The overall market sentiment (down 5.1% YTD) also plays a role.

The \"low to mid single digits\" growth guidance for the March quarter also adds to investor optimism.

Jefferies' downgrade, citing weak future iPhone sales due to limited hardware upgrades and slow adoption of Apple Intelligence, further dampens the outlook. Considering the others' estimations the trend seems to be adjusting towards a neutral viewpoint on the stock. Given all these factors, I'm slightly leaning towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, factoring in the strong earnings and forward guidance, but significantly weighting downside risk from the iPhone revenue miss and negative analyst sentiment.."

This miss, combined with a cautious outlook and the Jefferies downgrade, creates uncertainty. The initial after-hours surge suggests some positive sentiment towards overall performance and future growth, but the longer-term impact is unclear.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most models slightly favoring a price fall or a roughly even split. Considering the mixed signals and particularly the importance of iPhone sales to Apple's overall performance, I lean slightly toward a greater probability of a price fall, although the overall certainty is low.  The 3%+ after-hours jump is a mitigating factor but the significant number of negative indicators counters this. The year-to-date performance of the stock being down by 5.1% also suggests there's downward pressure, reinforcing a more pessimistic outlook."

This miss, combined with a cautious outlook and the Jefferies downgrade, creates uncertainty. The initial after-hours surge suggests some positive sentiment, but the longer-term impact is unclear. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with most models slightly favoring a price fall or a roughly even split. Considering the mixed signals and particularly the importance of iPhone sales to Apple's overall performance, and the downward trend in predictions across rounds, I lean slightly toward a greater probability of a price fall.  The 3%+ after-hours jump is partially offset by numerous negative indicators. The year-to-date performance being down 5.1% also suggests downward pressure."

The trend shows a gradual decrease in the probability of price increase, converging to 0.35, while models converge to the 0.65 probability of price fall.

The analyst's concerns are specific and credible, focusing on key aspects of Apple's business that could impact future performance.

Considering the strategic importance of emerging markets and the proactive management approach, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling.
