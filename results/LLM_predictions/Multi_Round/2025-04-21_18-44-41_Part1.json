        "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period. The +25.6% earnings growth comprises actual results from the four group members that have reported and estimates for Alphabet, Amazon, and Nvidia (that haven\u2019t reported yet).Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below that shows the group\u2019s earnings and revenue growth on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBeyond these Mag 7 players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +19.2% from the same period last year on +10.8% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in recent quarters and what is expected in the coming three periods.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe chart below shows the sector\u2019s growth picture on an annual basis.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe Tech sector has enjoyed a favorable revisions trend for the last few quarters, with the Mag 7 stocks in the fore front of the rising estimates trend. The +16.9% earnings growth expected for the sector for 2025 at present is up from the +15.8% growth expected three months back.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nThrough Friday, January 31st, we have seen Q4 results from 179 S&P 500 members, or 35.8% of the index\u2019s total membership. Total earnings for these companies are up +7.4% from the same period last year on +5.1% higher revenues, with 80.4% beating EPS estimates and 67% beating revenue estimates.\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates relative to other recent periods for the same group of index members.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe comparison charts below put the Q4 EPS and revenue beats percentages relative to other recent periods for the same group of companies.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKey Earnings Reports This Week\n\nThe 132 S&P 500 members on deck to report results this week include several blue-chip operators like Pfizer, Pepsi, Ford, and others, in addition to the aforementioned Mag 7 players (Amazon and Alphabet).\n\nBy the end of this week, we will have seen Q4 results from more than 63% of the index\u2019s total membership.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThe chart below shows the Q4 earnings and revenue growth expectations in the context of where growth has been in the preceding four quarters and what is expected in the coming four quarters.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nExcluding the contribution from the Mag 7 companies, S&P 500 earnings would have been up +5.6% on +4.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe chart below shows the overall earnings picture on a calendar-year basis, with double-digit earnings growth expected in 2025 and 2026.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nPlease note that the very strong growth expected in 2025 is not driven by one or two sectors but is rather broad-based.

While Apple's Q4 earnings beat expectations and received favorable market reception, this was attributed more to relief than strong performance.  Concerns remain about tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition, and the potential impact of tariffs.  The article highlights the significant AI investments by other tech giants (Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta), questioning their monetization strategy and suggesting Apple's AI struggles are a significant headwind.  The overall positive sentiment in the tech sector and the broader S&P 500 earnings season might offer some support to Apple's stock price. However, the specific challenges faced by Apple in China and its AI development outweigh the general positive market trends in this context. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered slightly higher than a price rise."

However, the company faces significant challenges in China, including tepid iPhone demand and increased competition from local players. Additionally, Apple's struggles in AI and potential tariffs are noted as risks. While the market reacted favorably to Apple's better-than-feared results, the underlying issues in China and AI could weigh on investor sentiment. The broader context of the 'Mag 7' earnings shows mixed performance, with some peers like Meta outperforming while others like Microsoft disappointed in certain areas. Given these factors, the stock price movement is likely to be influenced by a combination of relief from the earnings report and concerns over future growth prospects."

Apple (AAPL) is mentioned as part of the 'Mag 7' group, so there is a chance that the news will affect the stock price.

        "headline": "Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

While Apple's hybrid CapEx model provides some resilience against competition from other Big Tech companies, the overall sentiment remains cautious.

On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollouts could weigh on iPhone sales, and the analyst expresses uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. This suggests potential downside risk. On the other hand, Apple's hybrid CapEx model, allowing it to leverage other companies' AI investments, is seen as a positive, making it less vulnerable to competition like DeepSeek. The analyst maintains a 'Hold' rating, indicating a neutral stance. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the concerns about iPhone sales and the lack of a clear AI-driven upgrade cycle, but the mitigated risk from AI competition prevents a strong bearish outlook."

While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive factor mitigating the impact of increased AI spending by competitors (like the DeepSeek effect on Nvidia), he maintains a 'Hold' rating on the stock.  This is primarily due to concerns about iPhone sales, stemming from a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle. The analyst's 'Hold' rating suggests a neutral outlook, implying neither a strong bullish nor bearish sentiment.  The lack of a clear positive catalyst from the AI boom, coupled with concerns about iPhone sales, leans slightly towards a negative outlook, but the mitigating factor of the less aggressive CapEx strategy prevents a strongly negative prediction."

Analyst Tom Forte maintains a 'Hold' rating on Apple, citing uncertainty about a super-cycle or upgrade cycle driven by AI. While Apple's ability to leverage others' CapEx spending is seen as a strength, the lack of clear catalysts for an iPhone upgrade cycle or significant AI-driven growth may limit upside potential.

The analyst's 'Hold' rating reflects uncertainty about a significant AI-driven upgrade cycle and concerns about the timing of hardware/software rollouts impacting iPhone sales. However, Apple's hybrid CapEx model is a positive, mitigating risks from AI competition. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a slightly bearish sentiment, with the probability of a price fall hovering around 0.6. Given this trend and the analyst's cautious outlook, I will maintain a slightly bearish stance, adjusting based on the trend of previous predictions, but not as strong as the initial predictions. I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect the consistent trend in previous predictions."

                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's strategic advantage in its hybrid CapEx model, mitigating some risks from increased AI spending by competitors, concerns remain about iPhone sales due to a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle. The analyst's 'Hold' rating reflects this neutral to slightly negative stance.  The consistent trend in previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price fall.  While Apple's resilience in CapEx spending offers some downside protection, the lack of a clear positive catalyst from the AI boom and the concerns about iPhone sales outweigh this positive. Considering the analyst's cautious outlook and the consistent bearish sentiment from previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall than a price rise, but acknowledging the significant uncertainty.  The convergence of predictions around a 0.38-0.4 probability of a rise and a 0.62-0.65 probability of a fall suggests a strong bearish bias, which I will reflect in my prediction."
