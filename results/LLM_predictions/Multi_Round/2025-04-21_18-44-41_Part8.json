        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Oracle Corp. has charged out of the gate in 2025, after its best year in a quarter-century. A plan unveiled with President Donald Trump has intensified hopes that its cloud business will see a tailwind from artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools\n\nThe stock\u2019s latest advance came on news the software company is forming a $100 billion joint venture with SoftBank Group Corp. and OpenAI to fund an expansion of data centers to support a business in which Oracle lags behind rivals like Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\n\u201cThis certainly has us looking at the name in a way we hadn\u2019t before, since this could represent a meaningful inflection in growth,\u201d said Tim Ghriskey, senior portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder. \u201cIt seems like it is in good company here, but my main hesitation is about how long this halo might last, since the stock has really rocketed.\u201d\n\nOracle shares have performed like some of the tech giants that have driven the market\u2019s gains for the past two years, as it seeks to establish itself as a major player in cloud computing. The stock is up more than 10% in January after posting a nearly 60% gain last year, its best performance since 1999.\n\nThe joint venture has a goal of growing to \u201cat least\u201d $500 billion, which would be considerable in comparison to the tens of billions of dollars that megacaps have poured into AI. UBS expects the combined capex of major tech companies will come in at $280 billion in 2025.\n\nHowever, there are questions about the scope of new commitments and whether the news represents a dramatic increase from previously announced plans. Elon Musk publicly questioned whether the companies could follow through on their promises, while Anthropic\u2019s CEO also queried the financing and said the project seemed \u201ca bit chaotic.\u201d\n\nIn a sign of the headline whiplash that has accompanied his return to the presidency, Trump also said he would be open to Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison buying TikTok as part of a joint venture with the US government, a prospect that is difficult to measure in terms of its likelihood or impact.\n\n\u201cThis is all very speculative, and potentially meaningful, but it sounds crazy to me in a lot of ways,\u201d Ghriskey said. \u201cIt is good to be on Trump\u2019s good side, but that can be a short-term thing.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nA Small, Growing Player\n\nCompared to the big three of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc., Oracle is a small player in cloud computing. It has a less than 5% share in the infrastructure-as-a-service market, compared with Amazon Web Services at more than 40% and Microsoft around 16%, according to Bloomberg Intelligence \u2014 which also estimated the venture could help grow its cloud infrastructure sales from a roughly $10 billion annual run rate currently to $30 billion or $40 billion over the coming years.\n\n\u201cThis moves Oracle even closer to the ballpark that Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet are mentioned in,\u201d said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors, referring to the venture. \u201cWhile there\u2019s probably some hype around Trump\u2019s announcement, this is still a clear positive. It is in such a powerful long-term uptrend that you need to stay involved, even if valuations aren\u2019t exactly cheap anymore.\u201d\n\nWhile Oracle\u2019s most recent results failed to live up to high expectations, Wall Street has steadily grown more positive on its prospects, and growth in Oracle\u2019s cloud infrastructure business is expected to far outpace its overall revenue growth this year, according to Bloomberg Consensus estimates.\n\nStill, the stock\u2019s rally on the venture news hasn\u2019t been met with a commensurate increase in the analyst consensus. Expectations for the company\u2019s net 2025 and 2026 earnings are up just 0.2% over the past week, while the view for revenue is unchanged.\n\nThe stock\u2019s forward earnings multiple has swelled above 27, well above its 10-year average of 15.8. It also trades at a premium to the Nasdaq 100 Index, though it is below Microsoft\u2019s multiple of 31.\n\nJoe Tigay, portfolio manager of the Rational Equity Armor Fund, is among those taking a cautious eye toward the stock\u2019s rally.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s prudent to wait and see what the actual earnings are and what the actual company says about all these projects, rather than just pricing it in right now because the timing is often uncertain and how big of an impact is always uncertain.\u201d\n\nHe added that it was impossible to assess the the prospect of a deal surrounding TikTok without further details.\n\n\u201cIn terms of value for Oracle, it\u2019s really hard for me to say that would be great for the bottom line or terrible.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. has slumped almost 11% in January putting the stock on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. Earlier this week, at least two analysts from Loop Capital and Jefferies downgraded their ratings on the stock as weak iPhone sales are becoming an increasing concern for investors. The stock is down about 14% from a December peak.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nSK Hynix Inc.\u2019s shares slid after record quarterly results failed to impress investors grappling with stagnant smartphone demand and questions about AI spending in 2025. Elon Musk openly questioned whether companies that joined President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement promising hundreds of billions of dollars in artificial intelligence infrastructure could follow through on their promises, exposing an early internal rift within the White House. President Trump downplayed the national security risk posed by TikTok in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, days after offering the social video app a reprieve from legislation that would have forced it to shut down. India is trying to pry open the doors of the world\u2019s biggest app stores, setting up a likely clash with Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. over social services, safety standards and access to the country\u2019s smartphones. An Indian appeals court temporarily halted an antitrust ruling that fined WhatsApp and prohibited the messenger from sharing user data with other firms and products owned by parent Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nOSI Systems Postmarket\n\nTexas Instruments\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

The article also mentions Elon Musk and Anthropic's CEO questioning the project's financing and feasibility.

While this could be seen as a positive development for Oracle, the article also highlights skepticism from analysts and market participants regarding the feasibility and impact of these plans. The stock has already seen significant gains, and its valuation is high compared to historical averages, which might limit further upside. For Apple Inc. (AAPL), the news mentions a slump in its stock price due to weak iPhone sales and analyst downgrades, which are unrelated to the Oracle story. Given the negative sentiment around Apple's performance, the probability of a further decline is higher than a rise."

        "content": "Had you invested $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) when Warren Buffett became its CEO in 1965, you would have $42.5 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would have grown to just $343,000 over the same period, which highlights Buffett's incredible ability to pick stocks.\n\nYou won't ever find Buffett chasing the latest stock market trends, not even one as powerful as artificial intelligence (AI). However, four existing holdings in Berkshire's $297 billion portfolio of publicly traded securities are using AI to supercharge their legacy businesses.Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Domino's Pizza: 0.2% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nBerkshire bought shares in Domino's Pizza(NASDAQ: DPZ) during the third quarter of 2024 (ended Sept. 30), so it's a relatively new addition to the portfolio. It's the world's largest pizza chain, serving over 1 million customers per day from its 21,000 stores across 90 countries.\n\nDomino's uses technology extensively to improve efficiency, which translates into lower costs and higher profits. The company has deployed an AI algorithm to identify patterns in customer behavior, so it knows when to start making pizzas -- even before an order is officially completed on its website. That means customers receive their food faster than ever.\n\nEventually, Domino's wants AI to handle everything from inventory management to staff scheduling, so this is just the beginning of a technological revolution at the company.\n\nWinning the approval of Buffett and his team wasn't easy last year, because Berkshire was a net seller of stocks overall. Domino's was one of just five new additions to the conglomerate's portfolio, which might be a very bullish sign for the pizza giant.\n\n2. Amazon: 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is the world's largest e-commerce company. It also dominates the cloud computing industry, and it has a growing presence in digital advertising and streaming. AI isn't just a tool for Amazon, it's going to be a core part of its entire organization.\n\nThe company already uses AI in its recommendation engine to show customers products they are likely to buy. And it developed an AI assistant called Rufus to help customers with their purchase decisions.\n\nEven Amazon's fulfillment centers rely on AI -- aside from the fleets of autonomous robots, a new technology called Project Private Investigator uses AI and computer vision to identify defective products before they are shipped to customers.\n\nThen there is the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform, which is becoming a preferred destination for developers looking to build AI software. AWS is working to dominate the three core layers of AI cloud services: infrastructure (data centers and chips), large language models (LLMs), and software.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2024, management said AI revenue within AWS grew by a triple-digit percentage year over year, and it's currently growing three times faster than the cloud business did at the same stage of its life cycle.\n\nBerkshire bought Amazon stock in 2019, but Buffett has often expressed regret for not identifying the company's potential much sooner. Nevertheless, his company's position is worth over $2.3 billion, so Berkshire stands to make a substantial amount of money if Amazon remains a leader in the AI race.\n\n3. Coca-Cola: 8.4% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is the world's largest beverage company, with people in 200 countries consuming 1.9 billion servings of its drinks every day. Achieving that level of scale wouldn't be possible without technology, and Coca-Cola is staying true to its history as an innovator by investing heavily in AI.\n\nIn April 2024, the company made a commitment to spend $1.1 billion over five years on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform, where it will access a portfolio of AI services to improve its supply chains, productivity, and marketing.\n\nSpeaking of marketing, Coca-Cola has already used AI in several campaigns. It launched Create Real Magic during the recent holiday period, which allowed users to generate holiday-themed digital snow globes on the company's website.\n\nPrior to that, it used AI to create a promotional version of its flagship soda called Coca-Cola Y3000, which captured what the drink could taste like in the year 3000 based on mountains of data from customers.\n\nBerkshire acquired 400 million shares of Coke between 1988 and 1994, at a total cost of $1.3 billion. It never sold a single share, and today, that stake is worth over $25 billion. Buffett probably never anticipated AI would become such a big part of Coca-Cola's future, but Berkshire will benefit from the value it creates, nonetheless.\n\n4. Apple: 22.7% of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounted for around 50% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio at the beginning of 2024, but Buffett and his team decided to take some of the conglomerate's profits by selling over half of the position. Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, though, with a 22.7% weighting in its portfolio.\n\nManagement has been preparing for the AI revolution for a while. Its strategy began with hardware, because the company had to design new chips and components for its latest iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers that were powerful enough to support the technology. With those now in place, the company was able to launch its Apple Intelligence software last year, which introduced swathes of new AI features.\n\nThese include new writing tools that empower users to quickly summarize email and text messages and then generate outgoing replies. Apple Intelligence can also prioritize notifications for users based on their preferences, saving them time. Even the Siri voice assistant received a makeover, because it now taps into the knowledge and capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, so the company could eventually become the largest distributor of AI to consumers. Therefore, despite the selling spree last year, Berkshire could still do extremely well over the long term with its remaining stake.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Domino's Pizza right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Domino's Pizza, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Domino's Pizza wasn\u2019t one of them.

However, the news is not solely focused on Apple; it discusses Buffett's AI investments across multiple companies.  Therefore, the positive impact on Apple's stock price from this news is likely to be diluted by the broader context.  The overall market sentiment and other factors will also influence Apple's stock price.  A rise is more likely than a fall due to the positive association with Buffett's investment and Apple's AI initiatives, but the probability is not overwhelmingly high given the shared focus on multiple companies."

The overall AI market sentiment is positive, further supporting a potential price rise.  The previous predictions show a trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, but with some caution due to the stake reduction.  My prediction reflects the positive aspects of continued investment while acknowledging the uncertainty. The consistent trend of previous predictions, showing a gradual increase in the probability of a price rise, also informs my assessment. The fact that Apple remains the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio despite the reduction is a significant positive factor.  However, the market's reaction to the previous sell-off suggests a degree of caution remains.

        "headline": "Could Nvidia Unseat Apple as the Largest Company in the World in 2025?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) are the two largest companies in the world by market capitalization. While Nvidia is valued at roughly $3.38 trillion as of this writing and stands as the second-biggest business, Apple has a valuation of $3.46 trillion and is at the top of the heap.\n\nNotably, both of these tech giants are leaders in different corners of the hardware market. Nvidia is the leading designer of advanced graphics processing units (GPUs) for artificial intelligence (AI) and data center computing. Meanwhile, Apple leads the smartphone market with its iPhone lines and captures the majority of global operating profits from mobile phone sales.\n\nAs hardware-focused businesses, Apple and Nvidia's position atop the list of the world's most valuable companies looks even more noteworthy because software-focused businesses usually tend to be more profitable. But while Apple should be able to continue commanding very strong margins on its mobile hardware and other offerings in 2025, the stage could be set for Nvidia to deliver superior stock performance and take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" this year.\n\nNvidia's outlook for 2025 appears stronger than Apple's\n\nNvidia stock has been on an incredible run as rising demand for AI technologies has spurred massive sales and earnings growth for the company. The AI leader's share price rocketed 131.5% higher over the last year, and there were brief periods in 2024 when it had a higher market cap than Apple and stood as the world's largest company. While Nvidia's business has historically been shaped by cyclical demand trends in the semiconductor industry and will face tougher growth comparisons in 2025, its outlook still appears stronger than Apple's.\n\nApple is facing some performance headwinds in China -- its second-largest geographic segment by revenue. The mobile hardware giant hasn't been able to find a suitable Chinese partner to incorporate its Apple Intelligence platform into its latest iPhones. Due to regulations put in place by China's government, many products and services need to have a domestic operational partner in order to be sold in the country. As a result, the iPhone 16s in China do not have the Apple Intelligence platform and are facing a tougher competitive environment because of it.\n\nApple is also facing some regulatory pressures in the domestic market. In March of last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed an antitrust suit against the company alleging that it has created an illegal monopoly on the smartphone market by tying developers into its ecosystem through contractual restrictions. While it's possible that the DOJ under the new Trump administration will take a comparatively hands-off approach to antitrust matters and other issues compared to operations under the Biden administration, it's not clear the iPhone maker will benefit from this dynamic.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMargins and sales trends support Nvidia taking the crown\n\nOver the trailing-12-month period, Apple posted a gross profit of $180.7 billion on sales of $391 billion -- good for a gross margin of 46.2%. Meanwhile, Nvidia has posted a gross profit of $85.9 billion on sales of $113.3 billion across the same stretch -- representing a gross margin of 75.8%. So while Apple has generated far more overall sales and gross profit over the past year, Nvidia's gross profit margin is far higher. This distinction becomes even more significant when looking at recent sales momentum for both businesses.\n\nNvidia's revenue increased 94% year over year to reach $35.1 billion in its most recently reported quarter (ended Oct. 27, 2024). Earnings per share for the period surged 111% annually to reach $0.78.\n\nFor comparison, Apple's revenue increased 6% year over year to $94.9 billion -- and its diluted earnings per share rose 12% to hit $1.64. Market data from Counterpoint Research suggests that Apple's iPhone unit shipments fell 5% year over year in the final quarter of 2024, so sales growth will be harder to deliver with its next financial report.\n\nIn order to return to stronger sales and earnings growth, Apple may need to deliver a new product or a software service offering with a more groundbreaking impact. The company's iPhone lines reliably serve up strong sales and great margins, but the smartphone market is saturated -- and growth has become harder to deliver.\n\nIn contrast, the demand outlook for Nvidia's GPUs continues to be very strong in 2025 amid ongoing AI infrastructure spending, and the rollout of the company's new Blackwell processors should support strong sales expansion and margins. With that in mind, I think there's a very good chance that Nvidia will take the title of \"world's most valuable company\" back from Apple and hold on to it for most of this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Nvidia wasn\u2019t one of them.

While it acknowledges Apple's current market capitalization lead, it highlights several headwinds: slowing growth in the saturated smartphone market, regulatory pressures in the US, and challenges in China due to the lack of a local partner for Apple Intelligence. In contrast, Nvidia is experiencing rapid growth driven by strong demand for AI GPUs and boasts significantly higher gross profit margins. The article suggests Nvidia's outlook for 2025 is stronger.

Apple faces headwinds in China and regulatory pressures in the US, coupled with slower iPhone sales growth. While Apple maintains significant market share and profitability, Nvidia's current trajectory suggests a higher potential for market capitalization growth.  The article's conclusion leans heavily towards Nvidia surpassing Apple's market cap, but this is based on current trends and doesn't account for unforeseen market shifts or competitive disruptions.  Therefore, while the probability of Nvidia's rise is higher, the probability of Apple's fall is not necessarily high, as it remains a dominant player.  The news is more likely to impact Nvidia positively and Apple negatively, but the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be less dramatic than the potential impact on Nvidia's stock price."

However, the strong performance of Apple historically and its continued market dominance suggest that the impact of the news might be less dramatic than the article suggests. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to Apple's stock price falling, but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to its inherent strength and resilience."

The consistent trend in previous predictions across multiple models indicates a higher probability of Apple's stock price falling. Although Apple's established market position and brand strength provide some resilience, the overall negative sentiment and specific challenges detailed in the news further support the likelihood of a stock price decline."

It implies that the author believes Apple's existing products, brand loyalty, and ecosystem are sufficient to maintain its value. Therefore, the negative sentiment regarding innovation is somewhat mitigated. However, any negative press, even if qualified, can introduce uncertainty. I'm giving a slightly higher probability to a rise because the article argues that the lack of innovation shouldn't matter to investors, suggesting underlying strength.

While Zuckerberg's opinion carries weight, it's unlikely to significantly sway the market on its own.  The market's reaction will depend more on Apple's financial performance, future product announcements, and overall market sentiment.  Therefore, the probability of a significant price movement (either up or down) due to this news alone is low.

The reasoning consistently points to Apple's strong fundamentals (brand loyalty, ecosystem, financial performance) as mitigating factors against the negative sentiment.  While the criticism might cause some short-term uncertainty, the overall consensus suggests the market is likely to view this news as relatively neutral to slightly positive.  The consistent upward bias in previous predictions also suggests a potential positive market sentiment not fully captured in the news itself, perhaps due to other undisclosed factors.

                    "reasoning": "The news discusses strategies for trading options related to small caps and mentions Apple's earnings. While the focus is on small caps, the mention of Apple suggests that there may be investor interest in how Apple's earnings will impact the broader market. Given that small caps have rallied significantly, there may be a positive sentiment in the market, which could extend to Apple. However, the uncertainty surrounding earnings can lead to volatility. Therefore, while there is a chance of a price rise due to positive sentiment, the potential for a price fall exists due to earnings-related risks."

However, the provided content focuses more on small caps and hedging strategies using options on the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM). While the headline mentions 'how he thinks investors may want to play Apple's (AAPL) earnings', the provided text doesn't offer any specific insights or recommendations regarding Apple's earnings. Therefore, it's difficult to assess the likely impact on Apple's stock price based solely on this information. Without knowing the specific strategy or analysis related to Apple's earnings, a neutral stance is the most appropriate. I am assuming that the article contains some information about Apple's earnings, but without that information, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome."

The article does not provide any specific information about Apple's expected performance or any factors that would directly influence its stock price. Therefore, the news is largely irrelevant to predicting AAPL's price movement.

        "content": "The latest trading session saw Apple (AAPL) ending at $223.83, denoting a +0.53% adjustment from its last day's close. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.61%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.3%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 1.28%.\n\nShares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products witnessed a loss of 13.77% over the previous month, trailing the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.24% and the S&P 500's gain of 2.08%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on January 30, 2025. The company's earnings per share (EPS) are projected to be $2.36, reflecting an 8.26% increase from the same quarter last year. At the same time, our most recent consensus estimate is projecting a revenue of $124.1 billion, reflecting a 3.78% rise from the equivalent quarter last year.\n\nAAPL's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $7.43 per share and revenue of $412.79 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.07% and +5.56%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nEmpirical research indicates that these revisions in estimates have a direct correlation with impending stock price performance. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Apple currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nInvestors should also note Apple's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 29.97. This signifies a premium in comparison to the average Forward P/E of 12.99 for its industry.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AAPL currently has a PEG ratio of 2.18. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. The average PEG ratio for the Computer - Micro Computers industry stood at 1.61 at the close of the market yesterday.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Computer - Micro Computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 95, finds itself in the top 38% echelons of all 250+ industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nMake sure to utilize Zacks.com to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and more, in the coming trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The stock has also significantly underperformed its sector and the S&P 500 over the past month. The upcoming earnings report is a key event, with projected EPS and revenue growth. However, Apple's Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) suggests a neutral outlook. The high Forward P/E ratio and PEG ratio compared to its industry indicate that the stock may be overvalued. The positive industry rank provides some support.

Although the industry rank is positive, the overall picture is not overwhelmingly bullish. The lack of recent changes in EPS projections also suggests a lack of significant positive momentum.

Considering these factors and the trend of others' predictions, which generally suggest a cautious or neutral stance, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be around 0.45 and the probability of it falling to be around 0.55."

        "headline": "Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff's war of words with Microsoft rages on at Davos",
        "content": "DAVOS, SWITZERLAND \u2014 The weather may have been teeth-chattering along the promenade in Davos, but that didn't stop Salesforce (CRM) co-founder and CEO Marc Benioff from firing off a few new choice words on AI rival Microsoft (MSFT).\n\n\"Everybody knows that Microsoft has disappointed the world with Copilot and I mean, that's just a repackaged ChatGPT. You know that,\" Benioff told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum, continuing his long-running criticism of Microsoft's AI business tools.\n\nThis comes hot on the heels of a shot at Salesforce by Microsoft's often reserved CEO Satya Nadella.\n\n\u201cI think the notion that business applications exist, that\u2019s probably where they\u2019ll all collapse, right, in the agent era, because if you think about it right, they are essentially CRUD databases with a bunch of business logic,\u201d Nadella said on a recent podcast taping with venture capitalists Bill Gurley and Brad Gerstner.\n\nMicrosoft spokesperson Frank Shaw declined to comment to Yahoo Finance on Benioff's remark.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(CRM)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nBenioff's AI bots, which can autonomously answer customer questions or describe products to clients, are going toe to toe with Microsoft's Copilot for workplace supremacy.\n\nSalesforce closed 200 Agentforce deals in the third quarter. New users included FedEx (FDX), IBM (IBM), and Accenture (ACN). In total, Salesforce said it closed 2,000 AI-related deals in the third quarter.\n\nBenioff declined to provide an updated figure on the number of Agentforce deals closed since the end of the third quarter. A source familiar with Salesforce told Yahoo Finance consumption of Agentforce has been strong out of the gate, an important bottom line signal as the company gets paid $2 per conversation.\n\n\"Well, this is going way faster than anything we've ever done, and it has been amazing, and it's very exciting,\" Benioff said.\n\nThe Street has largely piled onto the bull narrative on AI agents, sending Salesforce's stock up more than 25% since new Agentforce solutions were introduced at the company's annual Dreamforce event on Sept. 17.\n\nBut there are a few skeptics.\n\nEarlier this month, Guggenheim analyst John DiFucci downgraded his rating to Sell in a rare move. He's only the second analyst on the Street to rate Salesforce a Sell out of 51, according to Yahoo Finance data.\n\n\"We do not believe that Salesforce will meaningfully monetize Agentforce unless it acquires several assets that have been doing, over the past decade, what Agentforce aspires to do. Salesforce's status as a system of record gives it staying power, but in our view doesn\u2019t give it any advantage in providing AI solutions that require dynamic data with rich context versus the static data that Salesforce houses,\" DiFucci said.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

While Salesforce's stock has risen significantly due to positive sentiment around its AI solutions, the skepticism from analysts like John DiFucci could create uncertainty in the tech sector.

While Apple (AAPL) is not directly mentioned, the broader context of AI competition within the tech industry could indirectly influence investor sentiment. However, the direct impact on Apple is minimal. The news highlights Salesforce's AI progress and some skepticism surrounding it. Microsoft's AI strategy is also questioned. Given the lack of direct connection to Apple and the mixed sentiment surrounding the AI competition between Salesforce and Microsoft, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be neutral.

The rivalry between Salesforce and Microsoft is relevant to those companies' stock prices but has no direct bearing on Apple's performance. Therefore, the probability of Apple's stock price movement due to this news is essentially neutral. Any movement would likely be due to other market factors unrelated to this specific news. Considering the mixed sentiment and the lack of direct relevance to Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of stability or a slight rise due to overall positive tech sector sentiment."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. plans to launch an ultrathin version of its Galaxy S25 phone in the first half of this year, beating Apple Inc. to a promising new category.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe company previewed a phone called the Galaxy S25 Edge at the conclusion of its Samsung Unpacked presentation Wednesday in San Jose, California. Building on an S25 lineup that was unveiled earlier at the event, the Edge model is notable for its extremely thin profile.\n\nThe move sets up a showdown this year in the skinny smartphone segment. Apple also is expected to add an ultrathin version to its iPhone line later this year, marking one of its boldest design changes in years. That company typically unveils its new phones in September.\n\nSamsung plans to start selling the Edge in the US and other markets by the middle of the year, TM Roh, president of the mobile devices business, told Bloomberg News in a separate interview.\n\nThe Edge will use some of the same technologies as the new Ultra model, but fit them inside a slimmed-down design. Customers want the \u201cbest performance, the best camera features, the best AI, but at the same time they want an even more attractive form factor that stands out among the pack,\u201d Roh said in the interview.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to combine all the advantages of the S25 Ultra in a slimmer form factor,\u201d he said.\n\nFor Apple, a skinny model is its latest attempt to find a new phone size that consumers embrace. In recent years, it has offered a mini iPhone and a Plus model, but neither of them were big hits. The Plus version will be replaced by this new thinner variant, which some are dubbing the iPhone Air, Bloomberg News has reported. It will be the skinniest iPhone in the device\u2019s history.\n\nRoh said Samsung chose the Edge name as a reference to both the thinner design and the idea that the phone will use more cutting-edge technology. It also recycles a brand used by Samsung several years ago when it first launched phones with curved-edge displays.\n\nRoh said the company has \u201chigh expectations for this product.\u201d Samsung hasn\u2019t settled on a price, he said, but acknowledged it will be cheaper than the $1,299-and-up Ultra.\n\n\u201cOur goal is to position this at pricing that is lower than the Ultra models, so it\u2019s more accessible and has more customers,\u201d Roh said.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

Overall, the competitive landscape suggests a higher probability of stock price decline than increase."

However, Apple is also expected to release a similar product later in the year, mitigating some of the negative impact. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as Samsung is first to market with this new form factor. The market's reaction will also depend on the actual features, pricing, and consumer reception of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge. Given that Apple is a large, diversified company, the impact of a single product launch by a competitor is unlikely to be drastic."

The success of the ultrathin phone market segment remains uncertain, and Apple's established brand loyalty and ecosystem are significant strengths.

Investors might perceive this as a competitive threat, especially given Apple's past struggles with new phone sizes (e.g., mini and Plus models).

However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and the anticipation of its own ultrathin model later in the year may mitigate some of the negative impact.

The estimated probabilities are based on the analysis of the competitive landscape, Apple's brand loyalty, and the anticipation of its own ultrathin model."

Apple's strong brand and ecosystem provide some buffer, but the first-mover advantage and potentially lower pricing of the Samsung device contribute to the likelihood of a short-term stock price decline. The previous rounds show a consensus around a 0.6-0.7 probability of a fall.

However, this pressure is likely to be muted due to several factors. Apple's own ultrathin iPhone release later in the year negates any long-term competitive disadvantage. Apple's strong brand loyalty and established ecosystem provide a significant buffer against short-term competitive pressures. The consistent trend across previous predictions shows a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.6 to 0.7. While Samsung's first-mover advantage is a concern, Apple's established market position and future product release suggest the impact will be less severe than initially feared. Considering the mitigating factors and the consensus from previous predictions, I'm aligning with the trend, acknowledging the potential for a muted response. The probability of a significant price drop is lower than some initial reactions might suggest; the short-term negative sentiment is likely to be temporary, and the long-term impact is expected to be minimal.  The slight shift towards a higher probability of a fall reflects the immediate market reaction to Samsung's announcement, but the overall impact is expected to be relatively small given Apple's market dominance and upcoming product launch."

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Cash App Stock to Buy According to Hedge Funds?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds.\n\nThe mobile payment service Cash App has grown significantly throughout the years, and in 2022 it was valued at $138 billion, up from $40 billion in 2020. Although its earnings increased to $2.95 billion, showing consistent yearly growth since 2018, its revenue decreased to $10.6 billion in 2022 from $12.3 billion in 2021, despite this remarkable valuation. Cash App\u2019s user base grew by 7 million from 2021 to 51 million in 2022, due to its user-friendly interface and array of financial services, which include peer-to-peer payments, Bitcoin investments, and cash card features. The four U.S. states of Texas, California, Florida, and New York together account for 48.75% of Cash App\u2019s user base, with over half of its customers concentrated in these states. As of 2020, there were just 10,000 active Android users in the United Kingdom, and its market share was less than 0.05%. In 2022, the platform handled more than 528 million transactions, demonstrating its increasing use. Cash App is positioned as a major participant in the digital payment ecosystem, particularly in the U.S. market, due to its excellent features and rising profitability.\n\nAs per findings by Apptopia, Cash App was the most downloaded payment app between April and May 2020, with a 20.1% increase in U.S. downloads, reaching around 4 million within that time frame. Additionally, usage increased, with roughly 250 million sessions in April\u2014the second-highest number among payment applications. As people looked for alternatives to in-person banking and provided financial support to friends and family, the pandemic caused a shift toward digital transactions, which is what is responsible for this surge.\n\nAccording to Block, Cash App\u2019s parent company, in a manner that many financial institutions have not been able to, Cash App has expanded access to the financial system and enabled a wide range of consumers to send, spend, save, invest, and comprehend their money more effectively. Its goal is to \u201credefine the world\u2019s relationship with money by making it more relatable, instantly available, and universally accessible,\u201d which is in line with this. Block believes Cash App can keep improving the economy both today and in the future.\n\nHowever, Cash App has also faced challenges. Recently, under Jack Dorsey\u2019s leadership, Block agreed to a $175 million settlement with the CFPB, which included a $55 million fine and up to $120 million in reimbursements for Cash App users. Allegations of widespread fraud and insufficient customer service on the platform were addressed in the settlement. The CFPB charged Cash App with facilitating fraud, sending users to banks, and neglecting to look into questionable transactions. Cash App accounted for over half of Block\u2019s 2023 gross profit, with over 56 million accounts. In addition, after 48 state regulators joined together, Block paid an $80 million fine for money laundering violations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe press release stated:\n\n\u201cWhile we strongly disagree with the CFPB\u2019s mischaracterizations, we made the decision to settle this matter in the interest of putting it behind us and focusing on what\u2019s best for our customers and our business,\u201d\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article, we reviewed multiple reliable websites and videos that discuss stocks available on Cash App. From there, we formed an initial list of the 20 Best Cash App Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds. From the resultant dataset, we chose 10 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors, using Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds in Q3 2024 to gauge hedge fund sentiment for stocks.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best Cash App Stock To Buy According to Hedge Funds?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nOver the years, its strong Services business segment has grown to include Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, which allow consumers to manage payments from their iPhones.\n\nBy concentrating on a high-end, intricately linked ecosystem of goods, services, and software, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has strengthened its long-term dominance in the consumer electronics sector. This ecosystem revolves around Apple\u2019s flagship iPhone, which generates 46% of the company\u2019s net sales. Giving it pricing power, switching costs, and network effects as a result. Retaining consumers inside this walled garden maximizes the benefits of all other Apple services and products. This approach gives the company room to flourish and sets it apart.\n\nFor the September quarter in Q4 of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported record revenue of $94.9 billion, up 6% year over year. This was driven by strong iPhone revenue of $46.2 billion, which climbed 6% and set a record for the September quarter across all geographic areas. Over 1 billion paid memberships throughout the firm\u2019s ecosystem contributed to a double-digit increase in services revenue, which hit a record high of $25 billion, up 12% year over year. The Apple Intelligence system, iPhone 16, Mac with M4 chips, new iPads, and improvements for the Apple Watch and AirPods were among the advances the company introduced. Furthermore, Apple broke revenue records in emerging markets, with the September quarter seeing an all-time high in India.\n\nIn terms of the environment, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made progress toward its goal of becoming carbon-neutral throughout its whole footprint by 2030 by launching the first-ever carbon-neutral Mac and a carbon-neutral Apple Watch option. These accomplishments highlight the company\u2019s robust innovation, growth, and sustainability leadership.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of best cash app stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential for AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "headline": "Samsung debuts Galaxy S25 line with a heavy focus on AI",
        "content": "Samsung on Wednesday took the wraps off of its latest flagship smartphones, the Galaxy S series, during its Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose, Calif. The latest phones are heavy on AI features, with modest hardware changes for the group.\n\nAvailable Feb. 7, the Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Android-powered lineup includes the $799 Galaxy S25, the $999 S25+, and the $1,299 S25 Ultra. The biggest differences between the phones are their screen sizes and camera arrangements. The S25 packs a 6.2-inch display, while the S25+ gets a larger 6.7-inch panel. The S25 Ultra gets a 6.9-inch screen.\n\nOn the camera front, the S25 and S25+ get 50MP wide angle, 12MP ultra-wide angle, and 10MP telephoto lenses with 3X zoom. The S25 Ultra, however, gets a 200MP wide-angle and 50MP wide-angle lenses, as well as 10MP 3x and 50MP 5x telephoto lenses.\n\nWhile hardware improvements traditionally drive sales, Samsung is leaning on AI to entice consumers to upgrade this time around. Specifically, the company points to its Galaxy AI platform and its slew of features, including the ability to interact with different apps on your behalf via AI agents.Samsung's S25 Ultra is all about the AI upgrades. (Image: Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nUsing what Samsung calls Cross App Action along with the company\u2019s Bixby assistant and Google\u2019s built-in Gemini AI, your Galaxy S25 will be able to look up information online and use it in a separate app. So you\u2019ll be able to ask your device to look up the next Kansas City Chiefs game and add it to your calendar and it will find the date and time of the next game via Google Search and create an event for it in the Calendar app.\n\nIf you\u2019re watching a YouTube video that includes a recipe for a dish you want to make on your own, you can ask your Galaxy S25 what ingredients you\u2019ll need to get cooking and the feature will pull the list from the video and add it to your Notes app.\n\nThese kinds of generative AI capabilities could prove to be far more useful for customers than the kind of text and photo-editing tools smartphone makers rolled out in their first stab at commercializing the technology.\n\nAt launch, Samsung says Cross App Action will work with certain Samsung and Google apps, as well as some third-party apps like Spotify, and the company hopes to expand the feature by working with other developers in the near future.Samsung is adding its Now Brief to the S25 lineup, as part of its big AI push. (Image: Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nIn addition to Cross App Action, Samsung debuted what it calls its Personal Data Engine, which powers S25 features like the ability to perform AI-powered on-device searches using natural language to find photos in the Gallery app. The Personal Data Engine also powers Samsung\u2019s Now Brief, which provides you with proactive updates throughout the day including a Morning Brief and Evening Brief in the Now Bar on the lock screen.\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a number of Samsung devices in your home, such as a smart Galaxy Ring, Samsung-compatible connected thermostat, and Samsung TV, the Personal Data Engine can combine information from those disparate sources to make helpful suggestions about how to best use them via the Now Bar.\n\nFor instance, if your Galaxy Ring, which offers sleep tracking, recognizes that you sleep better when the temperature is set to 68 degrees in your room, but the current temperature is 70 degrees, you\u2019ll receive a notification in the Now Bar suggesting you set up a routine that automatically turns the temperature down when you fall asleep at night.\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a Samsung smart TV and sleep with the TV on at night, you\u2019ll similarly get a recommendation via the Now Bar asking if you want to turn off the TV when your Galaxy Ring detects that you\u2019re snoozing.The S25 Ultra gets 5 different camera lenses including two telephoto lenses. (Image: Dan Howley)\u00b7Howley\n\nIf you don\u2019t want to use these AI features, Samsung says you\u2019ll also be able to turn off data collection at any time and delete any data if you\u2019ve already used the tool but don\u2019t want to anymore.\n\nThe personal data engine is only processed on-device, and the company says no apps can access it.\n\nAny services that use cloud-based AI, Samsung claims, provide end-to-end encryption that uses post-quantum cryptography to prevent hacking, even via quantum computing systems. Though those are still some time away from becoming a threat.\n\nAll of these new capabilities come with the regular bells and whistles Samsung includes in its yearly smartphone update, including improved processors and performance. This time around, Samsung says the S25 line will run on Qualcomm\u2019s (QCOM) latest Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy chip. You\u2019ll also get a choice of 128GB or 256GB of storage with the S25 and S25+ and 128GB, 256GB, or 1TB of storage with the S25 Ultra.\n\nWhether Samsung\u2019s latest Galaxy AI features will actually get customers to buy new smartphones is an open question. AI smartphones haven\u2019t exactly sparked the kind of widespread upgrade cycles experts had predicted.\n\nApple\u2019s (AAPL) stock, for instance, was hit with two downgrades this week on fears of weaker-than-anticipated iPhone sales. Now Samsung has to prove its latest offerings are worth the price of its latest smartphones.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

While the hardware improvements are modest, Samsung is heavily promoting its Galaxy AI platform. This could potentially attract consumers and increase Samsung's sales, indirectly impacting Apple. However, the article also mentions that AI smartphones haven't sparked widespread upgrade cycles and that Apple's stock was recently downgraded due to concerns about iPhone sales. This suggests that the market may be skeptical about the impact of AI features on smartphone sales. The article doesn't directly mention any negative impact on Apple, but the increased competition from Samsung and the general uncertainty surrounding AI-driven smartphone upgrades could create some downward pressure on Apple's stock. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than rise, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate."

Therefore, the Samsung news is unlikely to have a direct, significant positive impact on Apple's stock price.

There's a small chance the news could indirectly benefit Apple if it highlights the importance of innovation in the smartphone market, but this is less probable than the continuation of the negative trend."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Samsung Electronics Co. expects to enter the augmented reality glasses market in partnership with Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, according to the company\u2019s top mobile executive, jumping into a product category that is suddenly heating up.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nFresh off announcing a collaboration on their Project Moohan headset in December, the two companies are already working on AR glasses together, Samsung\u2019s TM Roh said in an interview. Roh, the president of Samsung\u2019s Mobile Experience division, didn\u2019t provide further details about the glasses, but said they\u2019d eventually launch as part of the company\u2019s efforts to co-develop the Android XR operating system.\n\nAs for when they would arrive in the market, Roh said the companies \u201cwill try to reach the quality and readiness we want as soon as possible.\u201d\n\nCreating true AR glasses \u2014 long the stuff of science fiction \u2014 has been an elusive goal of the technology industry. Google, Apple Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. have all sought to build a lightweight pair of spectacles that can overlay data and graphics on real-world views, but challenges related to cost and engineering have made progress slow.\n\nSuwon-based Samsung, South Korea\u2019s largest company and one of the world\u2019s most prolific smartphone makers, is looking for new engines of growth for its consumer business. The company expanded its range of wearable and health-related electronics last year with the Galaxy Ring, which tracks users\u2019 sleep, stress and exertion through the day. Android XR, which was announced as a project under development by Samsung and Google as \u201cone team,\u201d aims to deliver a unified OS for all classes of wearable headsets.\n\nAugmented reality glasses from the duo would compete with upcoming products from Meta \u2014 and potentially Apple, which has been more guarded about its plans. Meta aims to launch AR glasses dubbed Artemis in 2027, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday.\n\nThe Project Moohan headset, meanwhile, is a mixed-reality device \u2014 one that melds AR and virtual reality. It uses outward-facing cameras to mimic an AR effect, but it\u2019s mostly a VR device that fully encompasses the user. Roh said Samsung is still trying to determine the release date and price for that product \u2014 expected this year \u2014 but the level won\u2019t be based exclusively on manufacturing costs.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOne key part of launching the headset will be securing enough content for the device, Roh said, adding that Samsung and Google are working with third parties to develop tailored original content. Apple, with its $3,500 Vision Pro, has struggled to bring enough apps and entertainment to make the device a must-have purchase.\n\n--With assistance from Debby Wu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

                    "reasoning": "The news indicates increased competition in the augmented reality (AR) glasses market, particularly with Samsung and Google entering the space. This could pose a threat to Apple's market share, especially since Apple has been more secretive about its own AR plans. The mention of challenges Apple faces in securing enough content for its Vision Pro headset further suggests potential difficulties ahead. However, Apple's strong brand loyalty and existing ecosystem may mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the news leans towards a bearish sentiment for Apple due to increased competition and potential market share loss."

                    "reasoning": "The news indicates increased competition for Apple in the AR glasses market. While Apple already has a product (Vision Pro), Samsung's entry, backed by Google's Android XR, poses a significant challenge. The article highlights Apple's struggles with content for the Vision Pro, suggesting a potential weakness. Increased competition generally puts downward pressure on stock prices, especially when a competitor has strong backing. However, Apple's established position and brand loyalty provide some buffer. The market's reaction will also depend on the perceived quality and innovation of Samsung's upcoming product. Given the uncertainty and Apple's existing presence, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise."

                    "reasoning": "The news about Samsung and Google collaborating on AR glasses, and potentially competing with Apple in this market, is likely to have a moderately negative impact on Apple's stock price in the short term.  While Apple's Vision Pro is already on the market, it has faced challenges in attracting sufficient app support and achieving widespread adoption.  The entry of a major player like Samsung, with its strong brand recognition and established partnerships, increases the competitive pressure on Apple in the burgeoning AR market.  This increased competition could lead to slower-than-expected sales for Apple's Vision Pro and potentially impact investor sentiment. However, the impact is likely to be moderate because the AR market is still relatively nascent, and Apple's overall financial health and diverse product portfolio mitigate the risk.  The news is not overwhelmingly negative, as it simply highlights increased competition, not a significant threat to Apple's core business."

                    "reasoning": "The news headline indicates that Samsung is entering the AR glasses market, which is a competitive space where Apple is also a player. While this introduces new competition, Apple's position in the AR/VR space is already established with its Vision Pro headset. The news does not directly impact Apple's current products or market share significantly, but it could create long-term competitive pressure. Investors might view this as neutral to slightly negative for Apple, as it signals increased competition in a nascent market where Apple is investing heavily. However, the impact is likely muted given Apple's strong brand and ecosystem."

                    "reasoning": "The news headline indicates that Samsung is entering the augmented reality (AR) glasses market in partnership with Google, which could potentially compete with Apple's upcoming AR products. This development may pose a competitive threat to Apple's future product lineup, particularly if Samsung and Google successfully bring AR glasses to market before Apple. Historically, investors have reacted negatively to news that could potentially erode a company's market share or competitive advantage. Given that Apple's stock price is influenced by its perceived innovation and market leadership, any credible competitor in a high-growth area like AR could be viewed negatively. However, it's also possible that investors might see this as an opportunity for Apple to further innovate and maintain its market position, which could mitigate the negative impact. The probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be 0.3, reflecting a cautious investor response to potential competition. The probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be 0.7, reflecting concerns about Samsung and Google's potential to capture market share in AR."

However, the article also mentions that Apple has been more guarded about its plans, and the company has already announced its $3,500 Vision Pro. The increased competition may put pressure on Apple's stock price, but the company's established brand and loyal customer base may help mitigate this effect. Additionally, the news does not provide a clear timeline for Samsung's AR glasses launch, which reduces the immediate impact on Apple's stock price."

This could increase competition for Apple, which is also rumored to be developing similar technology. Increased competition might negatively impact Apple's potential market share in this emerging tech area. However, it also signifies growing interest and advancements in the AR space, which could indirectly benefit Apple if the market expands. Overall, the news leans slightly negative for Apple's stock."

While Apple's strong brand loyalty and established ecosystem may provide some buffer, the overall sentiment leans towards a negative impact on Apple's stock price due to increased competition and potential market share loss.

The market's perception of increased competition in a key growth area is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment."

While it introduces increased competition in the burgeoning AR market, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be moderate.  Several factors contribute to this assessment:\n\n* **Existing Market Position:** Apple already has its Vision Pro headset, establishing a presence in the AR market. The news doesn't directly threaten this existing product.\n* **Apple's Brand and Ecosystem:** Apple's strong brand loyalty and established ecosystem provide a buffer against immediate negative impacts.  The success of Samsung's AR glasses will depend on factors beyond just their existence.\n* **Nascent Market:** The AR market is still relatively new.  The impact of a new competitor might be less significant than in a mature market.\n* **Content Challenges:** The article highlights Apple's struggles with content for the Vision Pro. This is a concern, but Samsung and Google face similar hurdles.  The success of any AR glasses will depend heavily on content availability.\n* **Previous Predictions:** The consensus among previous models leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. This suggests a cautious market sentiment regarding the increased competition.\n\nConsidering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be muted in the short term. The long-term impact will depend on the success of Samsung's AR glasses and Apple's response."

        "content": "Samsung has unveiled its new range of flagship smartphones, complete with upgrades to its AI tools that the firm says make the technology more of a \u201ccompanion\u201d.\n\nThe Korean phone maker confirmed the new Galaxy S25, S25+ and S25 Ultra would go on sale on February 7.\n\nAt the heart of the new devices is what Samsung says is a substantial array of updates to its Galaxy AI features \u2013 including new abilities to work across different apps quickly to carry out tasks and the built-in AI being able to better understand the context of what a user is looking at on their phone at that moment.\n\nOne industry expert said the firm was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on the technology and had made \u201cclever enhancements\u201d to try and entice more consumers to upgrade or switch to Samsung.\n\nAI tools have become a key arms race in the smartphone market, with Samsung first launching its tools in January last year, followed by Google, Apple and others later in the year.\n\nAs part of its latest updates, Samsung said users will be able to make more complex and multi-layered requests \u2013 for example asking the built-in Google Gemini AI assistant to find a football team\u2019s fixtures online and then add them to a user\u2019s calendar \u2013 in a single command using text or their voice.\n\nSamsung has a close partnership with Google, as a user of its Android operating system on its smartphones, and said its enhanced AI tools would be able to work across all native Samsung and Google apps because of this partnership, as well as some third-party apps such as Spotify.\n\nAnother Google-made tool, Circle to Search \u2013 where users can draw around an item on screen they want to search for \u2013 has also been updated for the S25 and can now recognise phone numbers, email and web addresses on a user\u2019s screen.\n\nIn addition, Samsung has introduced new context-driven features called the Now Brief and Now Bar to the S25 series, which proactively gives users summaries, updates and app suggestions based on their usage and habits throughout the day.As well as enhanced AI tools, the S25 Series includes improved cameras and processors (Samsung)\n\nAnnika Bizon, director of mobile experience at Samsung UK and Ireland, said: \u201cModern life is hard. Balancing work and home is incredibly overwhelming, and we\u2019re all looking for ways to help us juggle life\u2019s demands.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve reached a point now where AI has evolved to become a companion \u2013 it\u2019s knowing intuitively what you need, and when. It\u2019s lightening your load so you can focus on the things that matter, at your own pace.\n\n\u201cIn many ways, it\u2019s becoming a pocket personal assistant for people, helping you manage your to-do lists.\n\n\u201cThe speed at which it\u2019s changing how we live is astonishing.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a year into Galaxy AI and it\u2019s rolling out nearly up to eight times faster than the internet when it first launched in Britain \u2013 which is something we all use every day.\u201d\n\nThe company confirmed the S25 would start at \u00a3979, the S25+ at \u00a3999 and the S25 Ultra \u2013 which comes with Samsung\u2019s S Pen stylus built-in \u2013 would start at \u00a31,249.\n\nIndustry expert and analyst Ben Wood from CCS Insight said Samsung was \u201cdoubling down\u201d on AI with some \u201cclever enhancements\u201d in the S25 range, but said some consumers were still to be convinced by the technology.\n\n\u201cLaunching new flagship smartphones has become a considerable headache for all the leading smartphone manufacturers,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cTop-end products are now so good that it\u2019s extremely difficult to deliver any meaningful differentiation from one year to the next. Samsung is not alone in this challenge, with Apple and all the other Android smartphone manufacturers in the same boat.\n\n\u201cLaunches are now characterised by \u2018slightly better everything\u2019, be that screen technology, battery life, processor performance, camera specs and more.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s little surprise that phone makers are hoping that a little \u2018AI magic dust\u2019 will help turn consumers heads, but that\u2019s proving to be a tough sell too.\n\n\u201cAt a time when improvements to hardware capabilities and product design are largely incremental, Samsung is doubling down on its AI story.\n\n\u201cThere are some clever enhancements included in the Galaxy S25 line-up, but it\u2019s unlikely they\u2019ll be enough to have consumers rushing out to upgrade their phones prematurely.\n\n\u201cHowever, this is far from being a unique issue for Samsung. Apple is facing the same challenges with the iPhone 16 and Apple Intelligence. AI is a boon for someone who needs an upgrade, but not enough to move the needle for consumers who have a relatively up-to-date phone already.\u201d\n\nView Comments",

Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is low, and the probability of a fall is also relatively low, with the stock price more likely to remain relatively unchanged, influenced more by broader market factors than this specific news. The slight downward trend in predictions across rounds is considered, but the overall impact is deemed minimal."

        "content": "Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financials) is allegedly close to settling a spat with Indonesia that stopped importing its iPhone 16 series, therefore stopping sales of the product. Bloomberg reports that Indonesian authorities expect a settlement within weeks that would allay worries about the company's adherence to local investment rules.\n\nImplemented in October 2024, the restriction was related to Indonesia's local content policies, which demand that certain of cellphones or their components be produced locally. Apple's first promised $10 million in funding was judged insufficient, hence the government decided to limit iPhone 16 sales. Apple responded by increasing their suggested expenditure to $1 billion, including intentions for an AirTag facility. Still, the presence of AirTagsclassified as accessories rather than necessary smartphone componentsdid not satisfy legal requirements.\n\nAs reported by Bloomberg, Indonesian Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani showed hope for a resolution of the problem. The minister said that differences in local content requirement computation have been found and are under correction. The fix would allow Apple to satisfy the necessary criteria and start national iPhone 16 series sales once again.\n\nReaching a deal might allow Apple to once again access one of the biggest consumer markets in Southeast Asia, hence increasing sales in the area, according to the report.\n\nApple has not yet commented on the topic.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

        "headline": "Intel races to find its next CEO, but insiders say no clear frontrunners yet",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) is racing against the clock to find a new chief executive who can launch the company into the artificial intelligence age \u2014 or risk sinking further into irrelevance.\n\nA series of strategic missteps dating back to the early 2000s and a failure to build cutting-edge technologies culminated in the once-dominant chipmaker\u2019s dramatic crash in 2024, when its stock plummeted 55%.\n\nIts board ousted CEO Pat Gelsinger in December and appointed two temporary co-CEOs.\n\nThe move laid bare the board\u2019s lack of a coherent strategy and called into question the fate of Gelsinger's bold turnaround plan: Opening up Intel\u2019s manufacturing business to make chips for external customers (i.e. operating a foundry).\n\n\u201c I think it's the board that should have been fired, not him,\u201d analyst William Lazonick, who has written extensively on Intel for the Institute of New Economic Thinking, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nSince Gelsinger\u2019s exit, the board has brought on two semiconductor experts, former ASML CEO Eric Meurice and Microchip chairman Steve Sanghi. Prior to their addition, only two of the 11 board members had semiconductor industry experience, per Citi analyst Christopher Danley.\n\nA Wall Street Intel analyst said Meurice and Sanghi are \"already ... challenging the plans [and] the processes within Intel.\" They asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the topic.\n\nIntel declined to comment on its CEO search.\n\nYahoo Finance spoke to analysts and several former high-level Intel executives, who offered their insights on who Intel\u2019s board might select to take the helm of America\u2019s only large-scale, leading-edge chip manufacturer.\n\nThe aforementioned Intel analyst told Yahoo Finance that temporary co-CEO David Zinsner \u201cdoesn't want the job.\u201d Several people with knowledge of the situation said Zinsner\u2019s counterpart, Michelle Johnston Holthaus, is being considered for the role. A former executive said the Intel veteran, who heads its products group, \"has a shot.\"\n\nThe former executive and another former high-level executive from Intel's manufacturing division critiqued Holthaus as lacking technical skill \u2014 a quality that analysts and Intel insiders agree is a must-have in its next leader.\n\n\u201c She never has an independent idea. She never drives an agenda,\u201d one of the former executives said. Intel describes Holthaus as \u201ca proven general manager and leader.\u201d\n\nMoor Insights & Strategy analyst Anshel Sag said the chipmaker will likely choose someone currently outside the company, but the decision will take a while.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs someone who's very tightly connected within the company, I have not gotten the feeling that they are even remotely close to picking someone,\u201d Sag told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBloomberg, citing unnamed sources, reported that Intel\u2019s external candidates include former Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) CEO Lip-Bu Tan, Marvell Technology (MRVL) CEO Matt Murphy, Intel board member Stacy Smith, Ampere Computing founder Renee James, Apple's (AAPL) internal chip head Johny Srouji, Analog Devices (ADI) exec Gregory Bryant, and Lenovo\u2019s (0992.HK) Kirk Skaugen.\n\nFive of those \u201coutsiders\u201d previously worked at Intel. Several of them spent more than a decade at the company and were pushed out under former CEO Brian Krzanich.\n\nThe Intel analyst also mentioned Boeing (BA) chair and former Qualcomm (QCOM) CEO Steve Mollenkopf and Eclipse Ventures general partner Sanjay Jha as potential candidates.\n\nSources have mixed opinions on whether it should hire an insider who knows the company well.\n\n\"Intel needs to be examined by a fresh set of eyes unburdened by prior affiliations,\" Futurum Group analyst David Nicholson told Yahoo Finance.\n\nBernstein semiconductor analyst Stacy Rasgon said Lip-Bu Tan is the candidate \u201ca lot of shareholders would love to see\u201d fill the role. Tan previously served on Intel\u2019s board but stepped down in August because he disagreed with Intel\u2019s foundry strategy \u2014 a plan that was aggressively pursued by Gelsinger. Former executives agreed that Tan is \u201cwell-respected\u201d and, in many ways, an ideal person for the role.\n\n\u201cLip-Bu knows how to do a turnaround, how to reinvent a business, how to incentivize change. He also knows how resistant Intel is to change,\u201d the aforementioned Intel manufacturing executive told Yahoo Finance.\n\nYet according to analysts, Tan would not be interested in such a leadership role at this point in his career. Tan also sits on the board of Gelsinger's Christian organization.\n\nOne of the former high level executives with knowledge of the matter said that Tan is still deciding whether he would consider taking the role.\n\nOne of the five former Intel insiders is AI startup Ampere founder Renee James, who was described by two of the former executives as \u201cstrategically brilliant\u201d and \u201cexecution-oriented.\u201d\n\nHowever, one of the sources, who worked at the company for decades, said that James does not have a good enough relationship with the board to be a top pick.\n\nStacy Smith \u2014 an Intel board member who previously worked at the company for nearly 30 years, including as CFO for roughly a decade \u2014 was described by the former Intel manufacturing executive as \u201ctrusted, respected, well-liked.\u201d\n\nSmith recently oversaw the IPO of Japanese company Toshiba\u2019s chip business as its executive chair, which was rebranded as Kioxia in recent years. The completion of Kioxia\u2019s IPO opens the door for Smith to take the Intel job, one of the former executives said.\n\nFormer executives also spoke highly of Kirk Skaugen, a former engineer who served in executive roles across Intel\u2019s PC and data center business. Apple's Srouji and Marvell's Murphy are both well-versed in semiconductors, but sources doubt either will take the top job.\n\nWall Street has mixed views on how long the CEO search will take. In a client note on Jan. 8, Danley suggested that the process could wrap up \u201cwithin the next couple of months,\u201d writing that \u201cthe company is relatively far along in the process.\u201d Meanwhile, KeyBanc\u2019s John Vinh wrote in his own note the same day that the process would likely take four to six months.\n\n\u201cThe board is currently looking at external candidates with no hard timelines,\u201d Vinh said.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nLast Friday, Intel\u2019s stock popped on a report that an unnamed company is trying to acquire the company. Analyst Dylan Patel suggested Elon Musk, while Citi wrote that Broadcom (AVGO) would be the most likely buyer. Last year, Qualcomm reportedly explored an acquisition before interest cooled off.\n\nIntel did not respond to a request for comment on the acquisition rumors.\n\nMeanwhile, US officials are eyeing a merger between US-based chip manufacturer GlobalFoundries and Intel, per Bloomberg.\n\nBut until a new CEO can be found, the chips giant is at a standstill. \u201cThe interim CEOs \u2026 will avoid altering the overall grand strategy in irreversible ways,\u201d KeyBanc analyst Vinh added in his note.StockStory aims to help individual investors beat the market.\n\nYasmin Khorram is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance.

While this news is significant for Intel, it does not directly impact Apple Inc. (AAPL). However, the uncertainty surrounding Intel's leadership and strategic direction could create a ripple effect in the semiconductor industry, potentially affecting Apple's supply chain and market position. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech sector, any instability in a key supplier like Intel could lead to cautious investor sentiment towards Apple. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight inclination towards a potential decline in stock price due to market reactions to Intel's situation."

While potential acquisition rumors and US officials eyeing a merger between GlobalFoundries and Intel could be positive, the overall tone is negative due to the leadership vacuum and strategic challenges. The article highlights internal disagreements and a lack of confidence in current leadership, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall in the short term. The potential for a turnaround with a new CEO is there, but the uncertainty outweighs the potential positive catalysts in the immediate future. The news mentions Apple's internal chip head Johny Srouji as a potential candidate for Intel's CEO, but it also casts doubt on whether he would take the job. This doesn't directly impact Apple's stock price, but it does indirectly suggest that Apple's internal chip development is strong, which could be seen as a slight positive for Apple in the long run. However, the primary focus of the news is on Intel's struggles, not Apple's performance."

While several potential candidates are mentioned, including some with strong backgrounds, there's considerable disagreement among analysts and insiders about the ideal qualities and even the likelihood of certain candidates accepting the role.  The ongoing search itself represents a period of uncertainty for Intel, which could negatively impact investor confidence.  The mention of potential acquisitions of Intel is a separate factor that could lead to a stock price increase, but the uncertainty surrounding the CEO search overshadows this possibility in the short term.  The news is primarily about Intel, and its impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and minimal.  The only connection is the mention of Apple's Johny Srouji as a *potential* external candidate for Intel's CEO position.  However, the article expresses doubt that he would take the job.

Additionally, the article mentions rumors of a potential acquisition, which could also positively impact the stock price. On the other hand, the lack of a clear timeline for the CEO search and the uncertainty surrounding the company's future strategy could lead to a decrease in stock price.
