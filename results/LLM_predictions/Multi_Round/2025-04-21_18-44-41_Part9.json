        "headline": "A Mother Tracks Her Son's Stolen iPhone On An 8,000-Mile Trip From NYC To Shenzhen, China \u2013 Here's What Irks Her More Than Losing The Phone",
        "content": "When a mother in New York City realized her son's iPhone was missing, she did what many parents would do \u2013 she immediately opened Apple's Find My app to track the device. What she discovered was both frustrating and fascinating, as the stolen iPhone went on an international adventure highlighting just how organized the black market for stolen electronics has become.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement \u2014 How do you compare? Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nFrom NYC to Shenzhen\n\nThe phone's journey began on Oct. 30 in NYC when it was snatched. First, it appeared in an apartment complex in the Bronx, then sat in a Long Island warehouse for a few days. Months later, it resurfaced nearly 8,000 miles away in Shenzhen, China, a well-known city hub for electronics manufacturing and repair.\n\nBy this point, the device was locked and useless to whoever had it, thanks to Apple's Activation Lock \u2013 a feature designed to prevent thieves from resetting and reselling stolen phones. Despite this, the phone's destination made sense. Shenzhen is home to Huaqiangbei, a sprawling electronics market where stolen phones are dismantled for parts or reassembled into \u201cnew\u201d devices.\n\nThe Scale of the Problem\n\nSmartphone theft is a widespread issue in the United States. Allstate estimates that 5% or an estimated 14.7 million phones were stolen in 2023 alone. Since iPhones make up about 50% of the smartphone market in the U.S., this translates to approximately 7.35 million stolen iPhones in a year. The financial damage is immense, not just in the cost of the devices but also in the security risks posed by potential data breaches.\n\nSee Also: \u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum.\n\nWhat Frustrated Her Most\n\nOddly enough, losing the iPhone wasn't the most infuriating part of the ordeal. What truly upset the mother was the lack of interest from local authorities. She filed a police report with the NYPD immediately after the theft, but the response was underwhelming. Even when the phone's location was trackable in NYC, nothing was done to investigate.\n\n\"I'm not that mad about losing this one phone,\" she shared, \"but I wish the NYPD had looked into the Long Island warehouse before it left NY. I bet there are a ton of other phones going through this same path.\" Her frustration resonated with others online, as many shared similar stories of police apathy toward stolen phones.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAs one person said, \u201cAnd I thought only in India police are not interested in stolen phone cases. Well, this has been the same for the entire world. Looks like a nexus to bring the phone to China where tracking is difficult because of the poor treaty.\u201d\n\nAnother tried explaining things further: \u201cPeople don't understand that filing a police report is literally just a report. It's not a request for the police to look into it or a declaration by the police that they will look into it.\u201d\n\nTrending: Maker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today.\n\nHow the Black Market Thrives\n\nShenzhen's Huaqiangbei district has become a hotbed for dismantling stolen devices. While Apple's Activation Lock, part of its Stolen Device Protection measures, makes it nearly impossible to reuse an iPhone, individual components like screens, batteries and chips can still be salvaged and sold.\n\nIn some cases, thieves even scam the original owners into removing the Activation Lock by sending fake messages claiming to be from Apple. Or, as someone said, \u201cHe'll start getting messages from someone claiming that they bought it and need him to remove the activation lock. Don't do it. Block and ignore. Eventually, they'll start threatening him. Again, ignore. They can't do anything.\u201d\n\nOrganized networks route phones from theft hotspots like NYC to international markets, with Shenzhen being one of the biggest destinations.\n\nThese operations are so well-oiled that stolen phones are often shipped in bulk, passing through intermediaries.\n\nRead Next:\n\nMany are using retirement income calculators to check if they\u2019re on pace \u2014 here\u2019s a breakdown on what\u2019s behind this formula. Deloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!\n\nUNLOCKED: 5 NEW TRADES EVERY WEEK.

                    "reasoning": "The news article, while mentioning Apple's iPhone, primarily focuses on the issue of smartphone theft and the black market for stolen electronics. While it highlights the effectiveness of Apple's Activation Lock in rendering stolen iPhones unusable, it also points to the organized nature of the theft and resale network, and the dismantling of iPhones for parts. The article also mentions the lack of police interest in stolen phone cases. This could be interpreted as a minor negative for Apple, as it suggests a potential vulnerability in the security of their devices and a problem with the overall ecosystem. However, the article also highlights the effectiveness of Apple's anti-theft measures. The overall impact is likely to be neutral to slightly negative. The article is more of a commentary on the broader issue of smartphone theft than a direct criticism of Apple. Therefore, the impact on the stock price is likely to be minimal. Given the nature of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise, but the overall impact is expected to be small."

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) edged higher Thursday after reports indicated the company is close to resolving its dispute with Indonesia, which has blocked iPhone 16 sales over local investment rules. Investment Minister Rosan Roeslani told Bloomberg in Davos that he expects a resolution within one to two weeks.\n\nThe government had previously rejected Apple's $1 billion investment plan, which included an AirTag factory, saying it did not meet local content requirements for smartphone production. Indonesia first imposed the ban in October 2024, citing Apple's failure to meet investment thresholds. The company initially offered $100 million over two years, later increasing the bid to $1 billion.\n\nReports last month suggested President Prabowo Subianto approved the latest proposal, paving the way for a deal. Roeslani said the government and Apple are now working through differences in how local content is calculated and expressed confidence that an agreement will soon allow iPhone 16 sales to resume in the Southeast Asian market.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

A $1 billion investment deal nearing completion suggests a positive outcome for Apple, potentially unlocking a substantial market. While the exact impact on Apple's overall revenue is uncertain, the removal of a sales ban in a growing market is generally viewed favorably by investors.  However, the market may have already partially priced in this positive outcome given previous reports suggesting the deal's approval. Therefore, while a price rise is likely, the magnitude might be less than if this news were entirely unexpected.

        "content": "Warren Buffett Once Claimed iPhones Are So Great That No One Would Take $10,000 To Stop Buying Them\n\nWarren Buffett, one of the most famous investors ever, has long admired Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and thinks it\u2019s one of the best companies in the world. He once made a bold claim that perfectly illustrates how much people love their iPhones.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett told CNBC\u2019s Squawk Box, \"If you're an Apple user and somebody offers you $10,000, but the only proviso is they'll take away your iPhone and you'll never be able to buy another, you're not going to take it.\" He believes people value their iPhones so much that even $10,000 wouldn't convince them to give them up forever.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\n\u2018Scrolling To UBI' \u2014 Deloitte's #1 fastest-growing software company allows users to earn money on their phones. You can invest today for just $0.26/share with a $1000 minimum. According to Juniper Research, the total value of B2B cross-border payments stored on the blockchain is projected to exceed $4.4 trillion \u2014 Join the first company to bring blockchain payments to Salesforce early with just $100.\n\nApple's Unmatched Loyalty\n\nBuffett says Apple is special because it creates products that people truly enjoy. The iPhone is not just a phone \u2013 it's an experience many users see as part of their daily lives. Even though there are other phones with cool features \u2013 like better cameras, folding screens or advanced AI \u2013 none give the same smooth and simple experience as iPhones.\n\nIt's not just the usability. Owning an iPhone makes people feel connected to a larger community. Giving up an iPhone, as Buffett suggested, means stepping out of a social circle and giving up the ecosystem that so many users find irreplaceable.\n\nOn the other hand, he said, \"If they tell you if you buy another Ford Motor car, they'll give you $10,000 not to do that, you'll take the $10,000 and buy a Chevy instead.\"\n\nSee Also: With 100+ historic trademark victories, this company holds IP for some of the highest-grossing characters in history. Now, they've propelled these icons into the future using next-gen patented AR, VR, and AI technology. There\u2019s now a limited window for investors to claim shares at just $2/share with $980 minimum\u2014but the clock is ticking.\n\nA Changing Landscape\n\nDespite Apple's stronghold on customer loyalty, the company has faced recent challenges. In 2024, iPhone sales in China dropped by 17%, marking the biggest annual sales drop Apple has seen in the country. It even lost its market leadership to local competitors like Huawei and Vivo. The broader Chinese smartphone market grew 4% during the same period, showing Apple's struggle to keep up with innovative, domestically produced alternatives.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple offered rare discounts on its iPhone 16 models in China to fight back. However, competition from foldable and AI-powered phones made by other brands continues to challenge Apple.\n\nTrending: This 12,000 RPM Spinning Battery With Over $100 Million In LOIs Could Be The Missing Link For Green Energy \u2014 Here\u2019s Why Early Investors Are Flocking To Invest Before Funding Closes\n\nBuffett's Evolving Strategy\n\nInterestingly, Buffett's actions regarding Apple have raised eyebrows. Berkshire Hathaway, the investment firm he leads, recently reduced its Apple stake by 25%, leaving it with 300 million shares. While Apple still accounts for 26% of Berkshire's portfolio, the sale reflects Buffett's commitment to his value investing principles \u2013 he's always looking for quality investments at a fair price.\n\nThis sale helped Berkshire build up $325 billion in cash, the most it's ever had. Some experts think Buffett is preparing for a possible market downturn or making things easier for the next leader of Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nRead Next:\n\nDeloitte's fastest-growing software company partners with Amazon, Walmart & Target \u2013 Many are rushing to grab 4,000 of its pre-IPO shares for just $0.26/share!

However, the article also points out challenges Apple is facing, including declining iPhone sales in China and increased competition from local brands. Furthermore, Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple by 25% could be interpreted as a bearish signal. Considering these factors, the positive sentiment from Buffett's past comments is somewhat offset by the current challenges and Berkshire's reduced stake.

While Warren Buffett's anecdote highlights strong customer loyalty to iPhones, this is counterbalanced by significant challenges in the Chinese market, where Apple experienced a substantial sales drop and lost market leadership.  Buffett's recent reduction of Berkshire Hathaway's Apple stake also introduces uncertainty. Although the reduction might be due to various factors unrelated to Apple's intrinsic value, it could be interpreted negatively by some investors.  The positive sentiment from Buffett's strong belief in the iPhone's desirability is tempered by the concerning sales figures in China and the strategic move by Berkshire Hathaway.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted more towards a neutral outcome, with a slightly higher chance of a price fall due to the negative market data."

                    "reasoning": "The opening of the Apple Miami Worldcenter store is a positive development for Apple Inc. as it enhances their retail presence in a vibrant market, potentially driving sales and customer engagement. The store's focus on environmental sustainability and accessibility aligns with current consumer trends, which may further bolster Apple's brand image and customer loyalty. Given these factors, the news is likely to have a favorable impact on investor sentiment, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase. However, the overall market conditions and other external factors could still influence stock performance, hence a balanced probability assessment is provided."

                    "reasoning": "The news reports the opening of a new Apple store in Miami Worldcenter. This is generally positive news, indicating continued growth and investment by Apple. The store's design emphasizes sustainability and accessibility, aligning with Apple's brand image and potentially attracting environmentally and socially conscious consumers. The mention of 'iPhone 16' suggests continued product innovation and sales opportunities. The 'Today at Apple' sessions and special programming are designed to engage customers and build brand loyalty. The news also highlights Apple's community involvement and economic impact in South Florida. However, the impact of a single store opening on a company as large as Apple is likely to be marginal. Therefore, while the news is positive, it's unlikely to cause a significant surge in the stock price. The mention of new products like the M4 chip and Apple Watch Series 10 is a positive sign for future growth."

                    "reasoning": "The opening of a new Apple store in a vibrant location like downtown Miami is generally considered positive news.  It signifies continued retail expansion and brand strength. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal.  Apple is a massive company, and the revenue generated by a single new store, even in a desirable location, is unlikely to significantly affect the overall financial performance.  The news is more of a positive PR event than a major financial catalyst. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, but both probabilities remain close to neutral."

This development is likely to be viewed positively by investors as it demonstrates Apple's continued expansion and commitment to customer experience, accessibility, and environmental responsibility. Such initiatives often enhance brand perception and can lead to increased sales and customer loyalty. However, the impact of a single store opening on Apple's overall financial performance is relatively minor given the company's global scale. Therefore, while the news is positive, it is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement. The market may already have priced in such expansions, leading to a neutral to slightly positive reaction."

                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple Inc. opening a new store, Apple Miami Worldcenter, in downtown Miami, is generally positive. The new store offers the full lineup of Apple products, features an industry-leading environmental store design, and provides various services such as Apple Trade In, carrier activation, and personalized setup. The store's focus on sustainability, accessibility, and community engagement is in line with Apple's brand values, which could enhance the company's reputation and potentially attract more customers. However, the impact on the stock price is likely to be limited as the news is about a single store opening rather than a company-wide strategic shift or a significant financial performance announcement. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate, while the probability of a stock price fall is low."

The store's unique design, focus on environmental sustainability, and commitment to accessibility are likely to generate interest and attract customers. Additionally, the store's location in a vibrant downtown area and its offer of various services, including Apple Trade In and personalized setup, may contribute to increased foot traffic and sales.

It aligns with Apple's focus on sustainability and accessibility, which are positive factors for its brand image. Such expansions often lead to increased sales and customer interaction, potentially boosting investor confidence. However, given that it's just one store opening and Apple is already a large and mature company, the immediate impact on stock price might be limited."

This new store is likely to attract customers and drive sales, particularly with the introduction of the iPhone 16 and other products. While the impact of a single store opening on Apple's overall stock price may be limited due to the company's size, the positive sentiment generated by this expansion and the emphasis on community engagement and environmental responsibility suggest a higher probability of stock price increase.

While the store's design and features are commendable and align with Apple's brand image, the impact of a single store opening on a company of Apple's size is marginal.  The previous predictions range from 0.25 to 0.75 for a price rise, with most clustering around 0.55-0.6.  Considering the relatively minor nature of the news compared to broader market forces and Apple's overall performance, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the possibility of a slight fall due to market fluctuations unrelated to this specific event. The consensus among previous models leans towards a slight increase in probability, but I'm tempering that enthusiasm given the limited impact of a single store opening."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Nasdaq 100 Index has nearly doubled since the start of 2023, adding $14 trillion in value in the process. Evercore ISI\u2019s Rich Ross is prepared for that rally to continue, shrugging off fears of a familiar nemesis: rising bond yields.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump Donations to LA Fire Victims Rise Past $200 Million Mark NY\u2019s Hochul Calls for Law Banning Cell Phone Use in Schools LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nTreasury rates jumped to multi-month highs last week as investors parsed economic data for clues on the Federal Reserve\u2019s next interest-rate cut following US President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory. The win ignited bets that his economic plans \u2014 like large import tariffs and mass deportations of low-wage undocumented workers \u2014 would stoke inflation and hurt growth, reducing the Fed\u2019s scope to lower borrowing costs. That\u2019s dented the appeal of rate-sensitive sectors, especially those with elevated valuations like technology.\n\nThe yield on the US 10-year has since pulled back after hitting a relative strength reading that usually signals a retreat. Pair that with positive technical signals and the Nasdaq 100 and S&P 500 Index both appear poised to hit fresh all-time highs in the first quarter, according to Ross, Evercore ISI\u2019s head of technical analysis.\n\n\u201cAt the end of the day technology remains in an outstanding position to continue to lead this market higher,\u201d Ross said.\n\nThrough Tuesday, the tech-heavy equities benchmark has gone 467 sessions trading above its 200-day moving average \u2014 the second-longest such streak since the index\u2019s inception four decades ago, according to data compiled by Bloomber.\n\nThe gauge currently trades around 10% above that long-term support level, a signal of relative stability to technical analysts who monitor daily averages and other metrics to determine stock-market momentum. This comes after the benchmark rose as much as 20% above that line in July \u2014 a level that preceded a summer rout and has historically foretold past selloffs.\n\nThe weeks ahead will be a pivotal stretch for stocks as Big Tech companies gear up to report quarterly earnings and the Fed\u2019s next policy decision looms on Jan. 29. With earnings season already underway, investors are listening for how corporate chiefs expect the coming months to look. Next week is the busiest of the season, with reports coming from the likes of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTo gauge where the 100-member index goes from here, John Kolovos, head of technical strategy at Macro Risk Advisors, is monitoring the largest exchange-traded fund tracking the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ). He sees technical supports between $485 and $495, around the ETF\u2019s November lows. In his view, any pullbacks that are still above those thresholds provide a dip-buying opportunity.\n\n\u201cFalling yields are good for market breadth and equity-market participation,\u201d said Kolovos. Technical analysts are also watching for whether Apple will catch a bid as the iPhone maker nears its 200-DMA.\n\nAfter the yield on the 10-year Treasury briefly topped 4.8% last week \u2014 above its 2024 high \u2014 its fallen more than 20 basis points since then to hover around 4.57% on Tuesday. For Kolovos, the next key support level on the benchmark note\u2019s rate is 4.5%, near its 50-DMA and a November peak. He\u2019s also watching 4.8% and the late 2023 highs at 5% for resistance. The 10-year yield\u2019s 14-day relative strength reading topped the 70 level two weeks ago, which some technicians view as a sign of overheating.\n\nWith the Nasdaq 100 roughly 2.4% below its December record, semiconductor stocks \u2014 a high-conviction idea from Evercore ISI\u2019s Ross \u2014 are making fresh highs relative to software shares, suggesting that traders are rotating back into the chipmakers like Nvidia Corp. that have powered the bull market\u2019s advance for more than two years.\n\nIn fact, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH), which holds chip bellwethers like Nvidia, Applied Materials Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc., has outperformed the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) in five of the past six weeks, data compiled by Bloomberg show.\n\n\u201cHigher rates weigh uniquely on smaller caps and cyclicals such that when we get relief from rates, the first response is to buy back those hard hit groups,\u201d Ross said. \u201cWhen the dust settles, we go right back to those strong secular trends, big cash piles and big moats offered by Big Tech.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Kendrick Lamar Turned Beef With Drake Into Music Superstardom Elon Musk\u2019s Inaugural Highs (and Lows) Greek Police Say Eggs Were Stolen from IVF Clinic Patients Walgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

The consensus from previous rounds leans towards a positive outlook for Apple (AAPL), driven by the bullish sentiment surrounding the Nasdaq 100 and the tech sector. Considering the consistent positive predictions in previous rounds, I will increase the probability of a stock price rise."

Positive technical indicators, a pullback in Treasury yields, and the anticipation of strong earnings from major tech companies all contribute to this positive sentiment.  While risks remain (upcoming earnings reports, Fed decisions, general market volatility), the overall tone is optimistic.  The consensus from previous prediction rounds also leans towards a higher probability of a price rise for AAPL.  However, I've slightly moderated the probabilities to account for the inherent uncertainties of the market and the potential for negative surprises in earnings. The fact that the Nasdaq 100 is already near record highs suggests a potential for consolidation or a minor correction, even within a bullish overall trend.  Considering all these factors, a moderate increase in the probability of a price rise compared to the initial predictions is justified."

The lack of specific details regarding the reasons for Apple's underperformance is a key factor.

Creative Strategies CEO and principal analyst Ben Bajarin joins Market Domination to share his perspective on the company's outlook.\n\nBajarin attributes current challenges to increased local competition in China's smartphone market. While Apple has \"generally dominated the premium price tier in China,\" he questions whether there is \"a lot of growth left for them\" in the region, describing it as \"a wait-and-see\" scenario.\n\nOn Apple's artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives, Bajarin believes the story will \"get more interesting\" over time, though he notes consumer AI remains in its early stages and \"everyone is struggling to create some value propositions there.\"\n\n\"I think you need to see a hardware cycle really kick in for people to start to get really excited again,\" he tells Yahoo Finance.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Market Dominationhere.

While AI is mentioned as a potential future growth area, the analyst notes that it's still in early stages and lacks clear value propositions.

The lack of immediate catalysts for a significant price increase, coupled with the negative analyst sentiment, points towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term.

The consistent bearish predictions from various large language models across multiple rounds further strengthens the negative outlook. The 'wait-and-see' attitude expressed by the analyst suggests a lack of immediate positive drivers.  While Apple remains a strong company, the immediate impact of the news points towards a higher likelihood of a short-term price decline.  The consensus from multiple models across several rounds points to a significantly higher probability of a price drop than a rise.

On Jan. 14, she purchased 50 call options each in Google-parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), with each position valued between $250,001 and $500,000.\n\nThe contracts expire in January 2026 with strike prices of $150.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nMaker of the $60,000 foldable home has 3 factory buildings, 600+ houses built, and big plans to solve housing \u2014 you can become an investor for $0.80 per share today. If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nThe former Speaker\u2019s largest recent transaction was a sale of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares on Dec. 31, disposing of 31,600 shares valued between $5 million and $25 million. On the same day, she sold 10,000 shares of NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ:NVDA) worth between $1 million and $5 million.\n\nThese trades follow Pelosi\u2019s hospitalization in Luxembourg, where she was treated for a hip fracture sustained during the 80th-anniversary commemoration of the Battle of the Bulge.

The performance has reignited debates about congressional stock trading, with critics calling for stricter regulations.\n\nIn September, President Donald Trump questioned the timing of Pelosi\u2019s previous trades, particularly regarding Visa Inc.

This could lead to negative sentiment among investors, potentially driving the stock price down. However, the overall market sentiment towards Apple remains strong, and the company's fundamentals are solid, which could mitigate the impact of her trades. Therefore, while there is a likelihood of a price drop due to her selling activity, the strong brand and market position of Apple may also support a rise in stock price. Balancing these factors, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise."

The news also mentions her buying calls on GOOGL and AMZN, which could be seen as a positive signal for those stocks, but this analysis focuses solely on Apple. The overall market sentiment and Apple's own performance will likely be more significant drivers of its stock price.

It could be due to portfolio rebalancing, personal financial needs, or even a negative outlook on Apple's future. However, the fact that this is just one data point among many influencing Apple's stock price makes it difficult to assign a high probability to either a rise or fall.  The overall market sentiment, Apple's upcoming earnings reports, and other news will have a far greater impact.

The stock is down 11% in January, putting it on track for its biggest one-month decline since December 2022. It has dropped 14% from a December peak.\n\nThe day erased more than $110 billion from the company\u2019s market capitalization, enough for it to close under Nvidia Corp. in size for the first time since November. Apple now has a valuation of $3.35 trillion, compared with $3.45 trillion for the AI-focused chipmaker.\n\nThe company was downgraded to hold at Loop Capital and cut to underperform at Jefferies, which became a rare firm with the equivalent of a sell rating on the stock. Just 8.5% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have a bearish rating, while about 63% have the equivalent of a buy.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee writes that recent weakness in iPhone sales has been worse than expected, with the China market a particular concern. Independent research indicates that iPhone sales sank 18.2% in China during the December quarter, while global unit sales fell about 5% in the final quarter of last year amid higher China competition.\n\nCiting a third-party survey, Lee added that \u201cUS consumers do not yet find smartphone AI useful,\u201d meaning that it is \u201cunlikely to kickstart a super upgrade cycle anytime soon.\u201d Given these trends, he wrote, Apple\u2019s March quarter guidance could disappoint.\n\nSeparately, Loop expects a \u201cmaterial iPhone demand reduction\u201d beginning in the March quarter \u201cbut materially amplifying\u201d in the subsequent two quarters. While the drivers of the firm\u2019s former buy rating could still materialize, analyst Ananda Baruah wrote, \u201cit certainly won\u2019t be for the next nine months given we\u2019re on the front end of 2.5 Q\u2019s of materially softening iPhone demand.\u201d\n\nApple is scheduled to report its first-quarter results next week.\n\nWith the downgrades, Apple\u2019s recommendation consensus \u2014 a proxy for the ratio of buy, hold, and sell ratings \u2014 stands at 4.02 out of five, its lowest since May, and down from an August peak of about 4.3. Just over 60% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a rate well below other megacap tech stocks, where the percentage of buy ratings tops 80% or even 90%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMoffettNathanson downgraded the stock earlier this month, citing concerns in China and the stock\u2019s valuation.\n\nAlso on Monday, Morgan Stanley named Seagate Technology its top pick among IT hardware names, replacing Apple.\n\n(Updates to market close, adds market cap detail.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

Multiple analyst downgrades citing weak iPhone sales, particularly in China, and a lack of AI-driven upgrade cycle are significant concerns. The stock has already experienced a substantial decline in January. The downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, along with MoffettNathanson earlier in the month, indicate a growing consensus of negative sentiment. The fact that Apple lost its top-stock crown to Nvidia further reinforces the negative outlook. The upcoming earnings report next week adds further uncertainty, with analysts suggesting a potential disappointment. The shift of Morgan Stanley's top pick from Apple to Seagate Technology is another bearish signal. While a small percentage of analysts still have a buy rating, the overall trend is downward, and the consensus recommendation is at its lowest since May.

Analyst downgrades from Jefferies (to underperform) and Loop Capital (to hold) further amplify negative sentiment.  The cited 18.2% drop in iPhone sales in China during the December quarter and the belief that AI won't boost sales significantly in the near term paint a bleak picture for the short-term outlook.  While 63% of analysts still have a buy rating, the recent downgrades and the consensus recommendation dropping to its lowest since May suggest a shift in sentiment. The significant drop in market capitalization and the fact that Apple is now valued below Nvidia further supports the negative outlook.

        "content": "Big Tech is kissing the ring of President Donald Trump after having a contentious relationship with him in his first term.\n\nThat schmoozing was on display at Trump's inauguration as the likes of Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google (GOOG) CEO Sundar Pichai, and Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook snatched better seats at the event than incoming cabinet members.\n\n\"I do think that in a lot of these cases, these are companies that had something that they had to fix. They had problems and potential risk that was out there. And I think they were kind of coming and saying, listen, we're willing to talk to you. We're willing to engage and at some level,\" Cloudflare co-founder and CEO Matthew Prince told Yahoo Finance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n\nThe tech veteran didn't attend the inauguration but added there has been \"kind of the war on tech\" that hobbled the industry.\n\n\"The tech industry is very much like one of the US battleships. It is an incredibly powerful force for the United States, around the rest of the world,\" he said. \"I think if we actually start investing in tech, and not just the big companies, but startups, little tech, all of the different organizations that are out there, that's a huge advantage that the US has.\"\n\nCybersecurity stocks have performed relatively well since Donald Trump's election win in early November.\n\nCloudflare has outperformed its peer group, rising about 28% since Election Day. Fortinet (FTNT) is up 18%. ZScaler (ZS) is up 3%, while Palo Alto Networks (PANW) has shed 3%.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NET)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nThe optimism could be traced to several factors.\n\nFor one, investment pros say Trump will be friendly to the cybersecurity business model. Recall that in September 2018, Trump signed off on the National Cyber Strategy. The doctrine aimed to encourage government and private investment in cybersecurity infrastructure. It also sought to bolster domestic innovation in the sector.\n\nSecond, a mega trend such as AI and potentially looser regulations around dealmaking under Trump may spur profits and valuations on the cybersecurity stocks.\n\n\"We believe the cyber security sector will have a robust 2025 and should be one of the strongest sub-sector with our view cyber security could be up 30%+ over the next year led by accelerated cloud and AI growth along with M&A we expect to be very active in this tech area,\" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives said.\n\nAnd three, a more digital-first world is simply getting riskier by the day, pointed out the World Economic Forum in its 2025 global cybersecurity outlook report. With that comes the need to bolster cybersecurity tools at companies and governments.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"The prevailing turmoil has affected the perception of risks, with one in three CEOs citing cyber espionage and loss of sensitive information/ intellectual property theft as their top concern, while 45% of cyber leaders are concerned about disruption of operations and business processes,\" the report said.\n\n\u2014\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

However, the article primarily focuses on the cybersecurity sector and its potential growth under a Trump administration. While the initial reaction might be slightly negative due to the 'kissing the ring' narrative, the overall context suggests a potentially positive outlook for the tech industry, especially cybersecurity. Apple's involvement is mentioned only in passing, and the article doesn't directly link Apple's actions to any specific negative consequences. Therefore, the impact on Apple's stock is likely to be minimal. The positive outlook for cybersecurity, while not directly benefiting Apple, could contribute to a general positive sentiment towards the tech sector.

Meanwhile, Apple saw its shares fall by almost 4%, landing its market cap at $3.33 trillion. The iPhone maker\u2019s shares are down by more than 9% so far this year, while Nvidia\u2019s shares are up 2%.\n\nJefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform\u201d in a note Tuesday morning, citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it is \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and artificial intelligence capabilities powered by Apple Intelligence. Analysts also noted that the SE 4 is expected to have one rear camera, while the iPhone 13 Pro and 14 Pro have three cameras.\n\n\u201cAs Apple Intelligence has yet to gain traction with consumers, a used iPhone 13 would be an attractive option to some consumers especially [because] the selling price could potentially be lower than that of SE4,\u201d Jefferies analysts said in the note.\n\nMeanwhile, iPhone shipments were down by around 4% year over year in the quarter ending in December, Jefferies said, citing data from the International Data Corporation. Jefferies added that supply chain checks suggest iPhone sales in China were down by a percentage in the \u201chigh teens\u201d in the quarter, leading the firm to cut iPhone shipment growth expectations.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView Comments",

The current market reaction, with Apple's stock falling almost 4% and Nvidia surpassing it in market capitalization, further supports this negative outlook.

The already-declining year-over-year iPhone shipments and the 4% drop in the stock price on the day of the news release further reinforce the negative sentiment.

        "content": "Doug Gurr ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022 - Shutterstock\n\nThe chairman of Britain\u2019s competition regulator has been ousted and replaced with a veteran Amazon executive as Donald Trump threatens a trade war with countries that seek to curb US tech giants.\n\nMinisters last night appointed Doug Gurr, who ran Amazon\u2019s UK arm for nine years until 2022, as interim chairman of the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA).\n\nHe will replace Marcus Bokkerink, who is leaving just three years into a five-year term at the watchdog, after an intervention from Jonathan Reynolds, the Business Secretary.\n\nIt is understood his exit is intended to signal that the Government is serious about its efforts to unlock growth, as the CMA has in recent years been attacked for attempting to halt a wide range of deals.\n\nThis includes an effort to block Microsoft\u2019s $69bn (\u00a356bn) takeover of gaming company Activision in 2023, which led to the former\u2019s boss Brad Smith claiming his confidence in the UK had been left \u201cseverely shaken\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, under Mr Gurr, Amazon accused the CMA of a \u201cspeculative\u201d effort to block a minority investment in the UK\u2019s Deliveroo in 2018.\n\nFive years later, Will Shu, Deliveroo chief executive, claimed the watchdog was \u201ctrying to kill companies\u201d.\n\nIndustry sources said the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink, a former consultant at Boston Consulting Group, could serve to \u201creassure\u201d the technology sector and say \u201cwe\u2019re taking growth seriously\u201d.\n\nHowever, they also pointed to the fact that Sarah Cardell, the CMA chief executive, has ultimate day-to-day responsibility for the regulator, raising questions over how she will collaborate with Mr Gurr.Sarah Cardell will retain overall responsibility for running the CMA - Betty Laura Zapata/Bloomberg\n\nClash with White House\n\nThe unexpected departure of Mr Bokkerink comes as Britain risks a clash with Mr Trump\u2019s new White House regime over its stance on global competition rules.\n\nThe CMA has already announced an investigation into Google over its search dominance this year, while The Telegraph understands it also has been preparing a second probe into the power of Apple and Google over smartphone app stores.\n\nMarc Andreessen, who donated to Mr Trump\u2019s campaign, last week said there were \u201cenormous challenges\u201d in the UK on competition rules, claiming they were \u201cextremely draconian, anti-tech, anti-business, anti-American policies\u201d.\n\nBrussels regulators have reportedly put major decisions on investigations into Apple, Meta and Google on hold \u2013 in part to assess the temperature of the Trump administration.\n\nCristina Caffarra, a competition economist, said: \u201cIf anyone tried anything that had the potential to make real change, we now know there would be unknown retribution as Trump has indicated he would protect American platforms from Europe, and they bent the knee.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cThere were four men [Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos and Sundar Pichai] in the front row [at Mr Trump\u2019s inauguration] worth nearly a trillion dollars, it\u2019s very clear he will protect them in some way.\u201dTech bosses Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk at Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration - Julia Demaree Nikhinson/AP Photo\n\nAndrew Griffith, the shadow business secretary, said that Labour\u2019s decision to appoint Mr Gurr in the name of growth \u201cseems odd when they are simultaneously appointing their trade union and party donors elsewhere\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, it comes as the Government faces calls to refer the attempted takeover of The Telegraph by an Abu Dhabi fund to the CMA as a breach of legislation banning foreign state ownership of newspapers.\n\nAn investigation of the potential threat to press freedom was paused last year to allow RedBird IMI, which had acquired an option on ownership, to secure an onward sale.\n\nThe process has failed to deliver a transaction, chiefly owing to Abu Dhabi\u2019s price expectations, and RedBird IMI recently urged Telegraph executives to make job cuts and abandon editorial investments prompting a demand for action this week from Sir Ian Duncan Smith, the former Conservative leader.\n\nHe accused the Government of \u201cfoot-dragging\u201d because \u201cthey don\u2019t want to upset the UAE.\u201d\n\nA request for the CMA to complete the investigation could allow Lisa Nandy, the Culture Secretary, to order The Telegraph\u2019s independent directors to sell the company at a market price to any acceptable buyer.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported the decision to remove Mr Bokkerink. A government spokesman declined to comment. The CMA was contacted for comment.\n\nView Comments",

On one hand, the appointment of Doug Gurr, an ex-Amazon executive, to head the CMA suggests a potentially more lenient regulatory environment in the UK, which could be beneficial for large tech companies like Apple facing antitrust scrutiny. The article explicitly mentions a potential second probe into Apple and Google's app store power. A less aggressive CMA could reduce the risk of costly legal battles and restrictions on Apple's business practices. However, the threat of a trade war with the US under a potential Trump administration introduces significant uncertainty. Trump's protectionist stance towards US tech giants could lead to retaliatory measures against companies like Apple if the UK (or EU) pursues aggressive regulatory actions. This uncertainty, coupled with the political implications of the CMA appointment (criticism from the shadow business secretary), creates a complex situation. Given the potential for both positive (less UK regulation) and negative (US trade war) outcomes, the impact on Apple's stock price is difficult to predict with high confidence. The potential for a trade war and the political controversy surrounding the appointment likely outweigh the benefit of a potentially more lenient CMA, leading to a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall."

While the news doesn't directly impact Apple's operations, the potential for increased regulatory scrutiny in the UK and a more pro-US tech stance from the Trump administration could influence investor sentiment.  A more lenient regulatory environment could be positive for Apple, but the uncertainty introduced by the political landscape and potential investigations creates risk.  The probability of a price rise is lower due to the uncertainty and potential for negative regulatory actions, while the probability of a fall is also not high as the news is not directly negative for Apple's core business."

        "headline": "Meta Plans Oakley-Branded Glasses, Explores Watches and Earbuds",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is working on upgrades to its popular smart glasses and is exploring new wearable devices such as watches and camera-equipped earbuds, aiming to embed its artificial intelligence features into more products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTexas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters How Sanctuary Cities Are Preparing for Another Showdown With Trump What LA\u2019s Fires Mean for the City\u2019s Housing Shortage Deadly Landslide of Garbage Displays Uganda's Missed Opportunity LA Schools Wrecked by Fires Plead on GoFundMe for Help to Reopen\n\nThe effort includes developing Oakley-branded smart glasses for athletes this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Meta\u2019s devices group, Reality Labs, also plans to release new high-end glasses with a built-in display in 2025, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiatives haven\u2019t been announced.\n\nOther products underway would compete with Apple Inc.\u2019s smartwatch and AirPods, the people said. And the company is making headway on its first true augmented reality product \u2014 a holy grail for the tech industry \u2014 for release around 2027. A representative for Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, declined to comment on the company\u2019s plans.\n\nThe flurry of products is part of a bid to reposition Meta as an AI innovator, with a focus on hardware that can usher in the next era of computing. The social media company has spent tens of billions on augmented and virtual reality development and launched multiple versions of headsets and glasses, but broad consumer acceptance has remained elusive.\n\nMeta currently sells Ray-Ban glasses that are embedded with cameras, microphones and other technologies. Though they stop short of being an AR device \u2014 one that superimposes data and images on real world views \u2014 the spectacles can take pictures, analyze the surrounding environment, play music and handle calls.\n\nThat product line, internally code-named \u201cSupernova,\u201d will be expanded in three major ways. First, the company is planning to introduce its current Ray-Ban glasses to new markets. Second, Meta is broadening its smart glasses technology to other fashion brands owned by partner Luxottica Group SA. That includes a new version \u2014 dubbed \u201cSupernova 2\u201d \u2014 that is based on Oakley\u2019s Sphaera glasses. This model, which shifts the camera to the center of the glasses frame, will be aimed at cyclists and other athletes.\n\nThe biggest upgrade this year will be a new higher-end offering that uses a design that\u2019s closer to the current Ray-Ban glasses. Code-named \u201cHypernova,\u201d this model will include a display on the bottom portion of the right lens that projects information into a user\u2019s field of view. People would be able to run simple software apps, view notifications and see photos taken by the device \u2014 capabilities that get a bit closer to the long-promised AR experience.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe device would carry a higher price tag. Some employees involved in the project expect the Hypernova glasses to cost around $1,000, compared with a $299 starting price for the current Meta Ray-Bans.\n\nMeta is testing an approach that lets users rely on a wrist strap \u2014 dubbed \u201cCeres\u201d \u2014 to control the glasses. The Menlo Park, California-based company has discussed offering this accessory in the same box as the Hypernova spectacles, which will also have touch controls on the frame\u2019s temple. The temple approach would be the standard input method if the wrist accessory doesn\u2019t pass muster.\n\nThe strap controller would be similar to one used by Meta\u2019s Orion prototype AR glasses, an unreleased product that the company showed off last year. The Hypernova product also may work with a smartwatch, but Meta doesn\u2019t yet offer such a device.\n\nFor about half a decade, Meta has explored releasing a smartwatch that would compete with models from Apple, Samsung Electronics Co. and others. Over the years, the company has changed the project\u2019s details and priorities, and it\u2019s canceled and uncanceled the device multiple times. Meta is now again weighing the idea of releasing a watch as early as this year \u2014 with a display that would be able to show photos taken with the company\u2019s smart glasses.\n\nFor now, Meta\u2019s glasses are essentially an accessory to users\u2019 smartphones \u2014 rather than a true replacement. But the company is moving toward more of an all-in-one product that would let consumers dispense with carrying a phone and other devices.\n\nThe Orion prototype, which relies on an external puck to handle computing, is a step toward that. The company aims to start offering that device to software developers in 2026 so they can build and test applications for it. The glasses would then be more enticing to consumers when they\u2019re released broadly.\n\nOrion itself will never be released to customers. Instead, the company looks to begin selling a follow-up version code-named \u201cArtemis\u201d as early as 2027. Meta still needs to overcome challenges relating to costs, display technology and manufacturing before actually shipping it.\n\nBut people with knowledge of Artemis prototypes say they\u2019re more advanced than the Orion test units and aren\u2019t as heavy. Weight has been a stumbling block for other headset devices, including Apple\u2019s Vision Pro.\n\nMeta also is creating prototypes of an AirPods rival with built-in cameras that can see the outside world and take action using AI. If Meta decides to produce the earbuds for consumers, they likely wouldn\u2019t hit the market for a couple of years.\n\nSuch a device would let users look at an object and ask the earbuds to analyze the item. The features would be similar to what Meta already offers with the Ray-Ban smart glasses, but in a product form that\u2019s already popular with consumers.\n\nBut here too there have been snags. It\u2019s harder for people with long hair to use the device, for example. Meta also remains unsatisfied with the angle of the cameras in recent demo versions. Work on the earbuds, called \u201cCamera Buds\u201d internally, remains early, the people said. And it\u2019s always possible that the company cancels the project if it can\u2019t resolve the challenges.\n\nApple also is exploring the idea of putting cameras on earbuds and has made progress over the past few months, Bloomberg News has reported. Samsung, which sells earbuds that are similar to Apple\u2019s AirPods, is considering a version with cameras as well, according to other people with knowledge of the matter.\n\n--With assistance from Riley Griffin.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

While Apple is a dominant player, Meta's entry, especially with AI integration and potential camera-equipped earbuds (a feature Apple is also exploring), poses a threat. The news also mentions Apple's Vision Pro facing weight issues, which could give Meta an advantage if they overcome similar challenges. However, Meta's history of unsuccessful hardware ventures and the long timelines (2027 for AR glasses) suggest the impact on Apple's stock will be limited in the short term. The fact that Apple is also exploring similar technologies (camera earbuds) mitigates the negative impact. Therefore, a slight negative impact is expected, but not a significant drop."

However, the article does not provide any direct negative information about Apple or its products. Instead, it highlights Meta's efforts to expand its product line and compete with other tech companies, including Apple. Given that the news is more focused on Meta's plans rather than any negative developments for Apple, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. Nevertheless, the potential competition from Meta could slightly increase the probability of Apple's stock price falling."

This increased competition could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple. The previous rounds of predictions consistently lean towards a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price, but the effect is expected to be minimal in the short term due to Apple's strong brand loyalty, established market presence, and ongoing innovation. Meta's products are still in development, and their success is uncertain. The timelines for Meta's products are also relatively long, reducing the short-term impact. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the potential competitive threat, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise. However, Apple's strong fundamentals will likely prevent a significant drop."

The timelines for Meta's products are also relatively long, reducing the short-term impact. Apple's strong brand loyalty, established market share, and ongoing innovation are likely to mitigate any significant negative effect. The consistent trend in previous predictions shows a slight negative bias, which I've incorporated into my prediction. The lack of any immediate negative news about Apple itself further supports a relatively small impact.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Billionaire Chen Tianqiao Dumped 3 Tech Stocks and Betting On These 4 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nChen Tianqiao is a prominent Chinese entrepreneur and investor, best known for founding Shanda Interactive Entertainment, one of the leading internet and gaming companies in China during the early 2000s. Tianqiao also heads Shanda Asset Management, a hedge fund that managed more than $1.7 billion in 13F securities at the end of the third quarter of 2024. Through his innovative approach to technology and business, Chen has become one of the pioneers of the online gaming industry and a significant figure in the global tech and neuroscience communities.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nChen Tianqiao was born in 1973 in the Zhejiang province of China. Raised in a modest family, he excelled academically and earned admission to Fudan University, one of the top institutions in the Asian country, where he studied economics. His early years were marked by a strong interest in technology and business, which would later define his career. After graduation, Chen began his career in the investment arm of the state-owned conglomerate Jinjiang Group, where he honed his business and financial skills. However, his entrepreneurial ambitions led him to leave the corporate world and pursue opportunities in the burgeoning internet industry.\n\nIn 1999, Chen co-founded Shanda Interactive Entertainment with his wife, Luo Qianqian, and younger brother, Chen Danian. The company initially focused on developing and distributing multimedia content but quickly shifted its focus to online gaming. In 2004, Shanda became the first Chinese online gaming company to list on the NASDAQ stock exchange, raising $152 million. By the mid-2000s, Chen was one of the richest individuals in China, with Forbes naming him one of the wealthiest self-made billionaires under 40.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks by combing through the 13F portfolio of Shanda Asset Management at the end of the third quarter of 2024. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nShanda Asset Management's Stake: $116.5 million\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company demonstrates several qualities that make it a solid investment pick. The first factor that may attract great investment is the company\u2019s financial growth, as reported in the third quarter of 2024. For instance, the total revenue record of $94.9 billion, up 6% from a year ago and the cash dividend was $0.25 per share of the company\u2019s common stock. The second great factor that may attract investment is the production of the new iPhone SE model, which is being prepared for an early 2025 launch that will include artificial intelligence (AI) features. Moreover, the company has collaborated with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT technology into its devices, which will enhance app personalization and user experience. Lastly, the integration of Apple Intelligence into a broader range of devices, including the iPhone SE 4, iPad, Apple Watch, and Apple TV, also holds great investment potential.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Billionaire Chen Tianqiao dumped and bet on. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article emphasizes Apple's financial growth, AI integration (ChatGPT and Apple Intelligence), and the upcoming iPhone SE model with AI features as positive factors. However, it also states that the author believes other stocks hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, acknowledging Apple's strengths but suggesting better opportunities elsewhere. Given the mixed signals, the probability of a significant price rise is tempered by the suggestion of better alternatives.

The article's emphasis on other stocks deemed more promising suggests a relatively neutral to slightly negative sentiment towards AAPL, at least compared to the other investments mentioned.  The fact that Tianqiao holds a significant stake indicates some level of confidence, but the article's overall tone downplays AAPL's potential for rapid growth compared to other opportunities.

        "content": "Shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) fell 4.1% on Tuesday, as of 12:30 p.m ET.\n\nApple was downgraded by not one but two Wall Street sell-side analysts, as preliminary figures for the December quarter suggest disappointing iPhone sales.\n\nJefferies and Loop take Apple down a notch\n\nToday, analysts at Jefferies and Loop Capital each downgraded their ratings on Apple.\n\nJefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded Apple from hold to underperform and lowered his price target from $211.84 to $200.75. Referencing International Data Corporation (IDC) data, Lee recalibrated iPhone shipment figures from 1% growth to a 2% decline in the December quarter. But even that may be optimistic, as IDC data indicates the potential for a 4% decline in iPhone shipments.\n\nThe main source of weakness is China, unsurprisingly, where independent research suggests an 18.2% decline in iPhone sales. The Chinese consumer is in a sort of recession at the moment, and low-priced domestic rivals appear to be taking share.\n\nLee also noted consumers don't appear to see a huge benefit from Apple Intelligence as of yet. As such, the anticipated AI-fueled upgrade cycle may not materialize as some think.\n\nLoop also downgraded Apple from buy to hold today, citing weak current trends and the potential for bad forward guidance for the March quarter. Loop remains a bit more optimistic than Jefferies, as it still anticipates a \"material amplifying\" of demand in the June and September quarters later this year. Loop still believes in Apple's \"structural\" long-term growth as an AI beneficiary, but the timing appears delayed.\n\nCan Apple figure out AI?\n\nAt over 36 times earnings, Apple appears expensive for a company that only grows in the single digits. Apple also has complications with China from a demand perspective and the fact that it manufactures iPhones there. Furthermore, it's an open question as to whether Apple can execute on AI.\n\nApple still has a huge, sticky customer base, so it doesn't appear there is any grave danger. But its valuation doesn't leave much room for disappointment at these levels.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

        "content": "Jefferies analyst Edison Lee downgraded the investment bank's rating on Apple's (AAPL) stock to Underperform and decreased his price target by 13% to $200.75 on Monday. Loop Capital also downgraded Apple's stock from Buy to Hold, with a revised price target of $230, down from $275.\n\nIn an investor note, Lee said he expects Apple to report lower-than-expected results for its December quarter and a miss on expectations for the second quarter on weak iPhone sales and a lack of interest in AI among consumers.\n\nShares of Apple fell as much as 3.7% midday on Tuesday. The stock is up 16% over the last 12 months. Big Tech rivals Meta (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) are up some 36% and 30%, respectively, over the last year, while Microsoft (MSFT) is up just 3.5%. The broader S&P 500 has climbed 20% in the same period.\n\nAccording to Lee, iPhone sales in China fell between 15% and 20% year over year. Apple is contending with a number of headwinds in the region, including the continued ascendence of local offerings from Huawei and Xiaomi and cautious consumer spending amidst a slower economic backdrop.\n\nApple isn\u2019t just dealing with trouble in China. Overall iPhone market share fell roughly 1% year over year in Q4 to 23%, according to estimates by Canalys and IDC. That\u2019s despite the fact that smartphone shipments rose 3%, Canalys reports.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nJefferies forecasts that iPhone revenue will decline 0.4% year over year for the first quarter, while total Apple sales will grow 2.8%, lower than the firm\u2019s prior estimate of 4.6%.\n\nPart of Apple\u2019s issue, Lee contends, is that the company\u2019s big push into AI isn\u2019t panning out as investors had hoped. Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence platform for the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, was expected to kick off a sales supercycle. But if IDC and Canalys estimates prove correct, it will throw cold water on the AI sales boost.Apple CEO Tim Cook (C) seen behind US President Donald Trump (R) and US Vice President JD Vance (L) after the two were sworn into office at an inauguration ceremony in the rotunda of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC, USA, 20 January 2025.

SHAWN THEW/Pool via REUTERS\u00b7via REUTERS / Reuters\n\nApple began rolling out Apple Intelligence in batches in October. It\u2019s a risky move for Apple, which generally debuts its latest and greatest products and services at one time via big, splashy launch events. That makes it difficult for customers to know when the platform will feature all of the capabilities Apple initially promised when it debuted Apple Intelligence in June 2024.\n\nAI smartphones and their counterpart AI PCs are struggling to gain traction despite a massive sales push from tech giants ranging from Apple and Google to Microsoft and Intel.\n\nApple\u2019s iPhone is its most important product, and China is among its most important sales regions. In 2024, the iPhone accounted for $201.1 billion of Apple\u2019s $391 billion in total revenue. The company\u2019s second-largest business segment, its Services division, brought in $96.1 billion.\n\nStory Continues\n\nChina, however, has proven to be a persistent area of trouble for Apple over the last two years. Sales in the region declined 8% in 2024, falling to $66.9 billion, and 2% in 2023. At the time, Apple blamed weakness in the renminbi versus the dollar and lower iPhone and iPad sales.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg\u2019s Mark Gurman, Apple will debut a new iPhone SE in the coming months, which could help goose overall sales in the mid-range smartphone market. The company is also set to roll out new entry-level iPads and new MacBook Airs, which could drive improved sales in the segments.\n\nApple will report its first quarter earnings after the bell on Jan. 30.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

While new product releases are mentioned, their impact is uncertain and doesn't outweigh the immediate negative sentiment. The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% midday Tuesday confirms the market's initial negative reaction. The underperformance of Apple stock compared to its Big Tech peers and the S&P 500 further strengthens the bearish outlook. The upcoming earnings report on Jan 30th will be crucial, but the lowered expectations set by Jefferies suggest a higher likelihood of a negative surprise."

The fact that the stock already fell 3.7% midday Tuesday reinforces this negative sentiment. While new product releases are mentioned, they are not seen as sufficient to offset the negative factors.

                    "reasoning": "The overwhelming consensus from multiple AI models across three rounds, coupled with the negative news itself, strongly suggests a high probability of Apple's stock price falling in the short term. The downgrades from Jefferies and Loop Capital, citing weak iPhone sales (especially in China), and disappointing AI performance are significant negative factors. The already observed 3.7% drop reflects the market's immediate negative reaction. While new product launches are planned, their impact is uncertain and unlikely to offset the current negative sentiment in the short term. The lowered revenue forecasts further reinforce the bearish outlook. The consistent bearish predictions, with probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.7 to 0.85 across multiple models, support this assessment. While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong, the short-term outlook based on this specific news is predominantly negative. The fact that the negative news is focused on iPhone sales, Apple's most important product, and China, a key market, further strengthens the bearish outlook. The consistent downward trend in predictions across rounds indicates a strengthening of the bearish sentiment.  The upcoming earnings report will be crucial, but the lowered expectations set by Jefferies suggest a higher likelihood of a negative surprise."

The downgrades include reduced price targets, with Jefferies lowering its target to $200.75 and Loop Capital to $230. Additionally, the article highlights declining iPhone sales in China, a key market for Apple, and an overall drop in iPhone market share. Analyst predictions also suggest lower-than-expected revenue growth, further dampening the outlook. While there is mention of upcoming product launches that could potentially boost sales, the immediate impact of the negative news and market sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term. The consensus from previous models also strongly supports a bearish outlook, with probabilities of the stock price falling ranging from 0.7 to 0.85."

The downgrades, combined with the decline in iPhone sales in China and the overall market share, suggest a negative outlook for Apple's stock. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple's push into AI is not panning out as expected, which could further impact the stock price. While the company is set to debut new products, such as a new iPhone SE, entry-level iPads, and MacBook Airs, which could potentially drive improved sales, the immediate impact of the negative news and market sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling in the short term. The consensus from previous models also strongly supports a bearish outlook, with probabilities of the stock price falling ranging from 0.7 to 0.85. Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling."

While new product rollouts might provide some upside, the immediate impact of the negative news outweighs any potential positive developments. Previous predictions from various models consistently indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling. Therefore, the cumulative evidence points towards a higher likelihood of the stock price falling."
