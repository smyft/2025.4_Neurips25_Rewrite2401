        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Australia\u2019s central bank is honing its focus on potential financial shocks linked to the nation\u2019s fast-growing A$4.1 trillion ($2.6 trillion) pensions industry, and working through multiple scenarios with regulators.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nSpeaking at a conference run by Conexus Financial on Thursday, Reserve Bank Assistant Governor Brad Jones said it would be a \u201cdereliction of our duty not to be engaging with the industry\u201d on liquidity risks. He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

While a major global economic downturn *could* indirectly impact Apple, this news alone doesn't present such a scenario. Therefore, the probability of a significant price change (up or down) remains low."

                    "reasoning": "The financial news discusses the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) heightened surveillance on liquidity risks within the Australian pension industry, with a focus on systemic financial shocks. Such risks mainly pertain to the local financial landscape of Australia and do not have direct implications on Apple Inc. (AAPL). Apple's stock is influenced predominantly by factors like product releases, global market conditions, and technological advancements rather than localized financial stability risks in Australia. The majority of predictions from previous rounds indicate very low probabilities of the stock price being impacted by this news."

        "headline": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Although Apple is highlighted as an AI superstar by Goldman Sachs and shows positive revenue growth, the overall bearish sentiment towards the tech sector and the possibility of reduced hedge fund investment outweighs the positive news of Apple's Q4 performance in terms of predicting short-term price movement.  The fact that the article itself downplays Apple relative to other, potentially cheaper, AI stocks further suggests limited upside potential in the immediate future."

Goldman Sachs' long-term optimism in AI provides some counterbalance, but the dominant short-term sentiment seems risk-averse, pulling back on tech investments. Considering the minor downward trend appearing in the previous rounds driven by short term market volatility and investor cautiousness, I'm adjusting my probabilities slightly downward.

Positive earnings reports generally lead to stock price increases, while disappointing reports can cause declines. The overall market sentiment derived from Q4 GDP and home sales data will also influence the stock price. Expected slower GDP growth (2.7%) is slightly concerning, but strong earnings could offset this concern. Given the anticipation around Apple's earnings and the potential for a positive surprise, along with relatively stable economic news, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, while also leaving room for the possibility of price decline given GDP slowdown concerns."

While the news itself doesn't provide any specific information about Apple's expected performance, the fact that earnings are being released creates uncertainty.  A positive earnings surprise could lead to a stock price rise, while disappointing results could cause it to fall. The macroeconomic data (GDP and home sales) could also influence investor sentiment and indirectly impact Apple's stock price, but their impact is likely to be less significant than Apple's own earnings report. Therefore, the probabilities are assigned assuming a roughly equal chance of positive and negative impacts from the earnings report, with slightly more weight given to the earnings report than general market sentiment."

Given the lack of specific information, it's difficult to estimate a significant movement in either direction. Therefore, I'm assigning a neutral probability to both rising and falling scenarios, with a slight bias towards a rise due to the general trend of the market and Apple's historical performance."

Positive earnings would likely boost the stock, while negative results could lead to a decline.  The expected slowdown in GDP growth to 2.7% introduces some downward pressure on the overall market, potentially offsetting a positive earnings surprise for Apple.  The previous predictions from multiple models show a consistent convergence towards a probability slightly above 0.5 for a price increase, reflecting the balance between positive expectations for Apple's performance and the potential negative impact of the broader economic context. This convergence suggests a cautious optimism, acknowledging the uncertainty inherent in predicting stock prices based on this news alone.  Therefore, I am assigning a probability slightly above 0.5 for a price rise, reflecting the potential for a positive earnings surprise while acknowledging the risk of a decline if earnings disappoint."

This positive signal from a respected investor like Buffett could attract other investors, increasing demand for the stock. Apple is a leading technology company with significant investments in AI. However, the article suggests Berkshire could possess more than one leading AI stock. It is unlikely a direct correlation between Berkshire's portfolio and Apple's stock price can be definitively established, as Apple is only mentioned in this relation and not directly named as a Berkshire holding. Without knowing the specific AI stocks held in Berkshire's other investments, it is hard to predict stock movement with high accuracy.

However, the news does not directly mention Apple as one of the companies invested in by Berkshire Hathaway. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there seems to be a range of opinions on how this news might affect Apple's stock price. Some models are optimistic, citing Buffett's reputation as a value investor and the potential for increased investor interest in AI-related stocks. Others are more cautious, noting the lack of direct connection between Berkshire's investments and Apple's stock. Taking into account the trend of others' beliefs as demonstrated in the previous rounds, it seems that the general sentiment leans slightly towards a potential increase in Apple's stock price due to the positive association with AI and Buffett's investment strategy. However, the probabilities should reflect the uncertainty and the indirect nature of the news' impact on Apple. The average of previous predictions is around 0.62 for a price rise and 0.38 for a price fall, considering the overall positive sentiment around AI stocks and Buffett's endorsement, as well as the indirect connection to Apple."

Initially, many models were bullish, but as rounds progressed, the lack of a direct link became clearer. The probabilities converge around 0.6 for a rise and 0.4 for a fall, mostly due to indirect association with positive AI sentiment driven by Buffett's investment and the consistent 'others' belief trends. I'm taking a more conservative approach reflecting this nuance. The absence of direct mention of Apple significantly weakens the bullish case.  Therefore, a slight probability increase for a price rise is predicted reflecting the aggregated analysis of the previous rounds, but acknowledges a considerable probability of no significant change based on this news alone."

The news also mentions a tech sell-off fueled by DeepSeek's AI. While Apple is involved in AI, the broader concerns about the Mag 7's capital allocation and reliance on each other for growth are more likely to create downward pressure, slightly increasing the probability of a stock price fall. Note, this analysis is based on limited information and a single article. Broader market dynamics and company-specific news would be needed for a more accurate assessment."

However, the core concern is the unsustainable nature of their dominance due to excessive internal spending and resulting low returns, symbolized by the 'snake eating its own tail' metaphor. While Apple is considered a relatively safe bet compared to others, the inherent risk of low returns, coupled with a broader tech sell-off (mentioned in the news), points towards a higher probability of a price decline in the short term. The lack of specific positive news for Apple amplifies the negative sentiment.  Across three rounds of predictions from multiple AI models, there's a strong consensus pointing to a higher likelihood of a price fall.  This consensus, combined with the article's central thesis, strengthens the prediction of a stock price decrease."

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 11 Best Consumer Electronics Stocks to Invest in Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)) stands against other best consumer electronics stocks to invest in now.\n\nThe global consumer electronics market has seen significant growth, reaching a valuation of $755 billion in 2024, with projections to hit $1.15 trillion by 2031, according to Research and Markets. This growth is driven by rising demand for innovative devices that enhance convenience. Consumer electronics, including smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and connected home devices, have transformed how people live, work, and connect.\n\nContinuous innovation also keeps the industry competitive, with companies focused on attracting consumer interest. Despite global economic challenges, the market remains resilient, driven by advancements in AI. In 2023, smartphone shipments reached about 1.2 billion units, reinforcing this category\u2019s profitability. The market is projected to grow to $1.13 trillion by 2025, with a 3% annual growth rate. North America, particularly the US, is at the forefront of the consumer electronics market, leading globally in terms of adoption and demand. The region is expected to maintain this leadership due to its swift embrace of cutting-edge technologies. In the US, the fast-paced lifestyle increasingly revolves around digital solutions, with automation becoming a key priority.\n\nTim Seymour, Seymour Asset Management CIO, appeared on CNBC\u2019s \u2018The Exchange\u2019 on January 18 to signify upcoming events and how they might correlate with current market dynamics. Seymour notes that the tech sector, which includes consumer electronics, has rallied under President Trump, creating a favorable hiring environment. He believes that at least half of the MAG7 stocks have defensible valuations. Regarding tariffs, he suggests that consumer-centered sectors, like consumer electronics, will be impacted first, with reports indicating that tariffs could negatively affect the economy, as highlighted by the World Bank and IMF.\n\nDiscussing the economic implications of tariffs, Seymour expressed skepticism about tax increases while acknowledging uncertainty around reductions. He reflected on the tariffs imposed against China in 2018 and 2019, which impacted manufacturing, including consumer electronics. While tariffs may hinder growth, he noted that a strong dollar could enhance the competitiveness of US products abroad. Seymour focused on tech companies with solid valuations for their growth potential. Large MNCs in consumer electronics may perform better with upcoming announcements and are less vulnerable to strategic influences than smaller firms. While he is cautious about growth scares overshadowing inflationary pressures in 2025, he maintains a positive sentiment overall.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMethodology\n\nWe first sifted through ETFs, online rankings, and internet lists to compile a list of the top consumer electronics stocks. We then selected the 11 stocks that were the most popular among elite hedge funds and that analysts were bullish on. The stocks are ranked in ascending order of the number of hedge funds that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024. The hedge fund data was sourced from Insider Monkey\u2019s database which tracks the moves of over 900 elite money managers.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a tech giant known for its innovative consumer electronics products. Its popular products include iPhones, Mac computers, iPad tablets, and wearables like Apple Watches and AirPods. It also provides an ecosystem of services like app stores, streaming services, and cloud solutions, which enhance the user experience across its entire product line.\n\nRecent years have witnessed a slowdown in iPhone sales growth. But the company\u2019s investments in AI, showcased by the recent introduction of Apple Intelligence, will reignite growth. Apple Intelligence, which is a suite of AI-powered tools and services integrated into the iPhone, assists users with tasks like email composition, notification summarization, and appointment scheduling.\n\nFollowing its launch of Apple Intelligence, Rosenblatt Securities maintained a Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) with a $262 target price on January 27. This was despite concerns about disappointing iPhone performance in the December quarter, echoed by UBS. While Apple Intelligence and upcoming software updates hold promise for future growth, intense competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, which offer advanced AI and aggressive pricing, poses a significant challenge. The company experienced a 7.7% sales drop in China in FY24. This decline came from competition from domestic brands and a sluggish Chinese economy. To mitigate this, it\u2019s shifting its focus from hardware sales towards revenue streams like its App Store services.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double-digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 1st on our list of best consumer electronics stocks to invest in now. As we acknowledge the growth potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold great promise for delivering high returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Analyst ratings remain positive (Rosenblatt Securities Buy rating). Furthermore, Mar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy sees the AI integration spurring iPhone upgrades and new monetization avenues. However, there are challenges, including slowing iPhone sales, intense competition from Chinese brands like Huawei, and a sales drop in China. Potential tariffs, as highlighted by Tim Seymour, could also negatively impact the company. While the overall sentiment is cautiously positive, the competition and potential economic headwinds suggest a more balanced assessment. Considering the bullish factors (AI integration, positive analyst ratings) and bearish factors (competition, potential tariffs, slowing iPhone growth), I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so. Furthermore, the mention of tariffs and the complex geopolitical landscape creates uncertainty. Given this ambiguity, the impact is likely to be tempered."

However, the mention of cheaper AI alternatives indicates that some investors might prefer other options, potentially limiting the upward price movement. Balancing these positive and negative factors, a moderate probability of a price increase is expected, but the uncertainty prevents a significantly higher estimate."

However, significant headwinds exist: slowing iPhone sales, intense competition from Chinese brands with aggressive pricing and AI capabilities, and a notable sales decline in China (7.7%).  The potential impact of tariffs also introduces uncertainty.  Previous predictions show a range of probabilities (0.55-0.75 for a price rise), reflecting the inherent ambiguity.  While the positives are notable, the competitive and economic challenges prevent a strongly bullish prediction.  Considering this balanced outlook and the trend of slightly decreasing probabilities of a price increase in previous rounds, a probability slightly below the average of the previous rounds is assigned. The consistent presence of both bullish and bearish factors, along with the observed trend of slightly decreasing probabilities in previous prediction rounds, suggests a cautious approach.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer's Game Plan: Top 14 Stocks to Watch.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nJim Cramer, the host of Mad Money, recently shared his thoughts on the upcoming earnings season, emphasizing that investors should tread carefully and avoid making any big moves.\n\n\u201cWhen people think about an exciting time for stocks, they think of the next two weeks, that's when some of the most important consequential companies on Earth report, practically at the same time. Throw in the actions of the new president and all I can say is, we're not gonna have any idea what the heck we're doing until we have time, probably at night to sift through all the data points and study all the conference calls.\u201d\n\nREAD ALSO: Jim Cramer Looked At These 7 Stocks Recently and Jim Cramer Recently Shed Light on These 9 Stocks\n\nCramer stressed that the current week, in particular, is too difficult for snap judgments. He warned that the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision on Wednesday will only add to the uncertainty. At one point, it seemed like the market could expect a rate cut, which would push stocks higher, but then Amex reported that its customers were spending at a rapid pace. He said:\n\n\u201cBut when American Express says today that its millions of customers are spending like mad, the Fed can't possibly give us a rate cut, can it?\u201d\n\nHe added that if the Fed does lower rates on Wednesday, it would likely be because Chairman Jerome Powell has caved to President Trump\u2019s demand for immediate cuts. In this complex situation, Cramer advised investors to just sit tight and not act, pointing out that it would be a \u201cno-win situation\u201d for Powell.\n\nAs if the pressure of earnings reports and the Fed's decision were not enough, Cramer also noted that this week would feature the release of the Fed\u2019s favored inflation measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. However, Cramer does not expect good news, given the high level of consumer spending.\n\n\u201cThe exhausting bottom line: Look it\u2019s a sheer hell week. Our heads will be spinning, swivel-like, lazy Susan even, as each day you can expect a flood of earnings and a sound bite from President Trump that upsets whatever order there might be. Like I always say, don\u2019t try to make decisions during this part of earnings season, just listen. It's too hard and I don't want you to lose money just because this is one of eight super exciting weeks of the year.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we compiled a list of 14 stocks that were discussed by Jim Cramer during the episode of Mad Money on January 24. We listed the stocks in the order that Cramer mentioned them. We also provided hedge fund sentiment for each stock as of the third quarter of 2024, which was taken from Insider Monkey\u2019s database of 900 hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nDuring the episode, Cramer talked about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and here\u2019s what he had to say:\n\n\u201cAfter the close, we have the most widely anticipated disappointment that I've ever seen. I'm about to be facetious. I want you to hear this. It's facetious but here's what we're gonna hear. Let's see. We have horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, a surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and of course, a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year, all way below the consensus. There, that's everything I've heard about Apple for the last two weeks.\n\nCramer advised against trading the stock, urging investors to hold onto it instead. He noted that Apple is an exceptional company with outstanding management and that any issues the company faces will eventually be addressed, even if the timing remains uncertain. Cramer emphasized that historically, it has been more beneficial to simply hold Apple stock rather than trying to trade it.\n\nHe also pointed out that his Charitable Trust has seen a remarkable performance with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) precisely because the company has control over its own future, which he said is easier to maintain when management is excellent and products are of the highest quality.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 11th on our list of stocks to watch according to Jim Cramer. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While Jim Cramer acknowledges potential near-term disappointments (horrendous Chinese cell phone orders, no lift from new AI, surprising slowdown in service revenues, lackluster Vision Pro sales, and a radical chop to the forecast for the rest of the year), he ultimately advises against trading the stock, emphasizing Apple's exceptional management, high-quality products, and historical resilience. His charitable trust's success with Apple reinforces the idea that long-term holding is preferable. Also Cramer discussed market uncertainty factors beyond Apple's specifics(earnings season, Federal Reserve's decision and Personal Consumption Expenditures(PCE), this adds to the unpredictable situation of the market affecting stock movement. The AI stocks' higher return compared to Apple also provides a slight negative outlook. Considering these competing factors, I believe the near-term probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but a significant drop is unlikely due to Cramer's overall positive long-term view. The Fed meeting could be a positive catalyst if it decides to cut the rate but the current market environment suggests otherwise."

However, he also advises against *trading* the stock and recommends holding, highlighting Apple's strong management and historical performance. This conflicting advice weakens the predictive power of his statement.  While his pessimistic outlook suggests a higher probability of a price fall, his recommendation to hold indicates a belief in the long-term prospects of the company, mitigating the immediate impact of negative news.  The market's reaction will depend on whether the actual earnings meet or exceed already lowered expectations.

The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, some leaning heavily towards a fall, others toward a rise. The wide range highlights the uncertainty inherent in interpreting Cramer's statement.  His prediction of disappointment is already likely priced into the market to some extent, possibly mitigating the immediate impact of the actual earnings announcement. However, significant deviation from expectations, either positive or negative, could cause a volatile reaction. Considering the conflicting signals (negative short-term outlook, positive long-term outlook, overall market uncertainty) and the spread of predictions in previous rounds, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall due to the immediate disappointment but acknowledge the possibility of a rise driven by factors beyond this specific news."

Despite Cramer's view on Apple's financial standing in the long term, considering the negative sentiment from his own statements and previously made price predictions, it is more probable that the stock price will decrease in the near future.

This negative outlook is reinforced by the majority of previous model predictions. However, Cramer's contradictory advice to *hold* the stock, rather than trade it, indicates some belief in Apple's long-term strength and resilience.  This long-term positive view, combined with Apple's historically strong performance and solid management, suggests that the potential drop may be limited and that a significant rebound is possible after the initial negative market reaction to the earnings announcement. The uncertainty surrounding the Federal Reserve's actions and the PCE inflation data further complicates the situation. Considering all factors, I estimate a higher probability of a short-term price fall, but a less extreme decline than some previous predictions might suggest, with the possibility of a relatively quick recovery."

        "headline": "DeepSeek sends 2 big signals that shatter tech investor assumptions: Snowflake CEO",
        "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nDeepSeek has caused a permanent reset in how AI development will unfold in coming years.\n\nAt least that's the take from Snowflake (SNOW) CEO Sridhar Ramaswamy, whose data storage company provides technology used by companies developing large language models like DeepSeek and ChatGPT.\n\n\"So what this [news] basically does is two things. One, it says there's still a lot of innovation left and many companies can aspire to train these models. But, two, it also raises the really interesting question of do you need to spend billions of dollars in order to train cutting-edge, world-class models? I think the jury is still out there for things like that, but it's basically upended our assumptions about where AI is going,\" Ramaswamy told me on Yahoo Finance's Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen in below).\n\nDeepSeek is a Chinese company that has burst onto the tech landscape seemingly out of nowhere.\n\nLast week, it surprised more than just markets after unveiling RI, its AI model that gave a ChatGPT-esque performance at an arguably cheaper price tag. RI costs a reported $5.6 million to build a base model, compared to the hundreds of millions of dollars incurred at US-based companies such as OpenAI and Anthropic.\n\nWatch: Why billionaire investor Ray Dalio is concerned about tech valuations\n\nFears mounted instantly that US companies are overspending on AI infrastructure, which includes Nvidia (NVDA) chips.\n\nIn response, stocks went haywire on Monday. Nvidia\u2019s market value dropped by $588.8 billion, or 16.97%. It was the biggest ever single-day loss in a stock\u2019s market cap in absolute terms, according to Deutsche Bank data. Monday's decline for Nvidia was larger than the total market cap of Exxon or Mastercard.\n\nThe sell-off in Nvidia has persisted into Wednesday, with shares down 4.5%. The AI darling has seen its stock tank 11% so far this year.\n\n\"DeepSeek model suggests the cost of training GenAI models is set to decline substantially \u2026 which we see leading to faster gen-AI product innovation and availability,\" Morgan Stanley tech analyst Brian Nowak said in a note.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nDeepSeek just revealed a huge risk to the stock market Billionaire Ray Dalio offers fresh tips on how to be a better investor Another bitcoin bubble will happen: Nouriel 'Dr. Doom' Roubini\n\nNowak stayed upbeat on Microsoft (MSFT) despite its investment exposure to OpenAI.\n\nInterestingly, Nowak thinks Apple's stock could be a winner as fears about DeepSeek's impact weigh on the Magnificent Seven names.\n\n\"Apple's AI ambitions are far more contained than the majority of the Mag 7 (or other frontier model developers), as Apple is currently focused on smaller, function-specific, on-device LLM's, rather than large frontier models. As a result, Apple's annual capex ($9.4B in FY24) is about 1/20th the scale of the US Tier 1 hyperscalers combined, and therefore if the market hyper-focuses on capex ROI, the threshold for Apple to deliver an attractive return is far lower (i.e. less risk) than the T1 hyperscalers,\" explained Nowak.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSnowflake's Ramaswamy thinks investors need to be on high alert for more developments out of DeepSeek rivals in China.\n\n\"Even the fact that they were able to do this coming out of nowhere is a wake-up call again, that there's lots of innovation to go and many people should be trying it,\" said Ramaswamy.\n\nThree times each week, I field insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and the broader implications for AI development costs have negatively impacted Nvidia and could signal a shift in investor sentiment towards companies heavily invested in large-scale AI infrastructure. However, Morgan Stanley's tech analyst Brian Nowak suggests that Apple's more focused and contained AI strategy, prioritizing on-device LLMs, could be advantageous in this scenario. This is because Apple's lower capex requirements make it less susceptible to concerns about ROI compared to hyperscalers. The news also contains concerns about the high valuation on technology stocks. Even though the news contains both pros and cons for Apple's valuation overall, based on the information contained in the news, the information skews toward the stock price rising in value based on current market conditions."

However, Morgan Stanley analyst Brian Nowak argues that Apple (AAPL) could benefit.  Nowak highlights Apple's more contained AI ambitions, focusing on smaller, on-device models, requiring significantly less capital expenditure than larger competitors. This contrasts with the concerns raised about the massive investments of companies like OpenAI and Anthropic.  Apple's lower capex makes it less vulnerable to the market's reassessment of AI investment returns. Therefore, while the overall tech sector experiences negative pressure, Apple's different approach positions it for relative strength, suggesting a higher probability of price increase for AAPL compared to the overall negative sentiment."

Two main issues raised by Oppenheimer analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt were growing competition in China and a dearth of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps to propel near term device upgrades.\n\nReferring to Canalys statistics, the company observed that Apple exports to China dropped 25% in the fourth quarter and dropped 17% in the fourth quarter. Young noted that a delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 might arise from Apple Intelligence's sluggish adoption and the lack of major generative AI consumer apps.\n\nFrom prior predictions of $431 billion and $7.73, Oppenheimer reduced its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates to $407 billion and $7.22, respectively.\n\nAfter the market closes on Thursday, Apple is scheduled to unveil its first-quarter fiscal 2025 earnings.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Analysts have significantly reduced sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, indicating a bearish outlook. In addition, specific statistics showing a 25% drop in exports to China and a potential delayed iPhone replacement cycle into fiscal 2026 further reinforce the negative sentiment. Given the overwhelming focus on these negative indicators, it is highly likely that investor confidence will wane, leading to a higher probability of the stock price falling rather than rising. Although earnings are to be released, the pre-emptive downgrade suggests a market expectation of disappointing performance. Thus, the probability of stock price falling is substantially greater than that of it rising."

The lowered fiscal 2025 sales and EPS estimates further solidify this bearish outlook. Furthermore, the previous rounds of predictions overwhelmingly favored a stock price fall, suggesting that the consensus is already aligned towards a negative reaction. Given that other models also had high prediction values around 0.7 and 0.8 for a fall, I am factoring in convergence, which usually means that market behavior may be more predictable if consensus is forming."

The reduced sales and EPS estimates for fiscal 2025 further solidify this negative outlook.

The consensus among previous models leans heavily towards a price drop, ranging from 0.7 to 0.8 probability.

Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. Given this negative outlook, it is likely that the stock price will fall.

While the upcoming earnings report introduces some uncertainty, the preemptive downgrade and significant issues cited (e.g., -25% China exports) outweigh potential positive surprises.

The consensus across multiple AI models over three rounds strongly predicts a higher probability of a stock price fall, averaging around 0.75-0.8.  While the upcoming earnings report could provide a positive surprise, the pre-emptive downgrade and the severity of the negative factors largely outweigh any potential positive impact.  The consistent negative sentiment and convergence of predictions across models reinforce the likelihood of a price decrease. I'm adjusting the probability slightly higher to reflect the weight of the negative factors and the strong consensus."

The analysts have reduced their sales and earnings per share estimates for fiscal 2025, pointing to a delayed iPhone replacement cycle and a lack of compelling Apple Intelligence and generative AI apps. The 25% drop in exports to China is particularly concerning. These factors collectively suggest a bearish outlook for Apple's stock in the near term.

The analysts cited reduced iPhone sales forecasts over the next 12 to 18 months, growing competition in China, and a lack of convincing Apple Intelligence and generative artificial intelligence apps. Oppenheimer also lowered its fiscal 2025 sales and earnings per share estimates. The consensus across multiple AI models, over three rounds of predictions, consistently indicates a higher probability of the stock price falling due to these negative factors. The significant drop in exports to China (25% in Q4) and the lack of immediate positive catalysts further reinforce the bearish outlook.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 12 Safest Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other safe stocks.\n\nHedge funds, known for their sophisticated investment strategies and ability to generate returns across market cycles, have a complex performance history. Since their inception in 1949, hedge funds have evolved significantly, with returns varying widely by strategy, market conditions, and the broader economic environment. The first hedge fund was created by Alfred Winslow Jones in 1949, combining long and short equity positions to hedge against market risk. During the 1950s and 1960s, hedge funds gained attention for their ability to outperform traditional mutual funds. Jones\u2019s fund reportedly generated returns of approximately 20% annually in its early years, setting a precedent for the industry.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nThe 1970s and early 1980s were challenging due to high inflation, stagflation, and the oil crisis, but some hedge funds excelled by capitalizing on macroeconomic trends. Macro-focused funds like those led by George Soros delivered impressive returns by making bold bets on currencies and commodities. For example, Soros famously earned $1 billion in 1992 by shorting the British pound. The 1990s were a golden era for hedge funds, marked by rapid industry growth and strong performance. The average annual return of hedge funds during this period was approximately 15%, according to data from Hedge Fund Research. Managers benefited from a booming stock market, globalization, and the rise of new asset classes.\n\nNotable successes included Tiger Management, led by Julian Robertson, and Renaissance Technologies, whose Medallion Fund achieved annualized returns exceeding 30%. The 2000s were a mixed decade for hedge funds. The early 2000s saw strong performance during the dot-com crash, as many funds profited from short positions in overvalued tech stocks. Between 2000 and 2002, the S&P 500 fell by 43%, while hedge funds, on average, delivered positive annualized returns of around 6%. However, the 2008 financial crisis tested the industry. The HFRI Fund Weighted Composite Index declined by 19% in 2008, its worst annual performance on record. However, since the 2010s, there has been a prolonged bull market, barring minor blips during the pandemic, during which hedge funds have shined relative to other investment vehicles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected stocks that have solid businesses with recurring revenue streams, reliable dividend payouts, and burgeoning growth pipelines. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. This company offers a robust investment case for several reasons. Apple has achieved 11 consecutive years of dividend growth, exceeding the sector median of 1.7 years by 555%, reflecting its commitment to consistently increasing shareholder returns. The company is also planning to launch a new low-cost iPhone, a refreshed low-cost iPad, and an M4 MacBook Air. The iPhone SE, the company\u2019s first device with an Apple 5G modem, will see an update in 2025, and it is expected to feature a 6.1-inch OLED display, Face ID, and an iPhone 14-like design. It will be the first Apple device with an Apple 5G modem. Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on an 11th-generation iPad with a faster chip and support for Wi-Fi 6E. The tablet is also expected to feature Apple's custom-designed modem chip, an A17 Pro chip, and 8GB RAM. Lastly, the iPad Air is going to get updated with either an M3 or M4 chip, and it could debut alongside a new lower-cost Magic Keyboard that Apple is developing for the more affordable iPad models.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the safest stocks to buy according to hedge funds. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company's strong performance history, consistent dividend growth over 11 years, and upcoming product launches further support a positive outlook. Given these factors, there is a high probability that investors will react positively to this news, suggesting an increase in stock price. However, the market conditions can change, and there is always some level of uncertainty present.

So, a lot of this may be actually what gets said in the press conference, and what is the CEO's kind of body language,\" Kaiser says. \"How committed are they to that CapEx spend? How vital do they think that spending [is], and particularly, the really, really high-end Nvidia (NVDA) chips are to their development?\"\n\nWhile generally positive on large-cap growth, Kaiser remains cautious due to the lack of clarity and information on DeepSeek's new AI model and its efficiency.

While not directly mentioning Apple's earnings or capex guidance, the article highlights that CEO commentary and commitment to AI development (and specifically, access to Nvidia chips) is very important to investors. The expert's comments indicate that strong commitment and aggressive capex plans related to AI are generally being received positively by the markets. However, there is uncertainty regarding DeepSeek's AI model and its affects on competition, which introduces some potential volatility. Since the main focus is on CEO commentary, and Apple hasn't yet reported, this information is largely neutral until Apple actually releases its earning results. Thus, the effect on Apple is speculative to the news, but still relevant to the overall market sentiment around big tech. Therefore, the short-term price movement is likely to be neutral. However, because the article also mentions Apple's competitors (Microsoft, Meta, IBM) and their AI commitments, strong news on this front would positively impact the whole sector, which would likely include Apple. Overall, I see better chances of a rise than a fall here because the general sentiment will be bullish if Apple is commited to competing in the AI race."

The news focuses more on CEO commentary regarding AI-related CapEx, so the impact on a specific company prior to its earnings release is somewhat speculative. Given this context, and considering that there's uncertainty regarding the DeepSeek AI model, I will modestly increase the probability of the stock rising, because those previous predictions can be seen as weak signals, and I believe there will be stronger earnings results than expected."

Shares were down a fraction in morning trading.\n\nThe investment firm also removed its $250 price target, reducing its full-year revenue and EPS forecasts to $407 billion and $7.22, down from $431 billion and $7.73. Analysts Martin Young and Andrew Northcutt pointed to increased competition in China and the lack of compelling generative AI applications as key risks for iPhone growth over the next 12 to 18 months.\n\nCiting Canalys data, Oppenheimer noted that iPhone shipments to China declined 25% in Q4 and 17% for all of 2024. Analysts expect the iPhone replacement cycle to slow into FY 2026, given the gradual rollout of AppleIntelligence features and stronger AI competition.\n\nApple is set to report Q1 earnings post-market on Thursday, with Wall Street expecting adjusted EPS of $2.35 on $124.04 billion in revenue.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While the upcoming earnings report could provide some positive news and mitigate the impact, the pre-existing negative sentiment significantly increases the chances of the stock price falling, at least in the short term.

Considering these factors, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.25 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.75."

Given these factors, I maintain a pessimistic forecast, anticipating the downward pressure on stock prices to persist, though earnings could still provide some volatility. After considering previous rounds of evaluations that have mostly been bearish, I would slightly adjust the likelihood downwards to reflect that the sentiments are getting over-saturated, and the earnings release could still be better than the already lowered expectations.

While the news highlights potential advancements in AI modeling from China, it also emphasizes national security risks, which could prompt regulatory scrutiny and impact investor sentiment negatively. Thus, the likelihood of a stock price decline appears higher than that of a rise, as fears of geopolitical tensions and competitive pressures could lead to sell-offs in Apple stock. However, the overall sentiment about market viability and technological advancements might buffer some reactions, though likely not enough to prevent a decline."

China is a crucial market for Apple, and the AI race is heating up, putting pressure on Apple to innovate.

Therefore, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term, though the magnitude of the fall is uncertain and will depend heavily on the earnings report.

Although the earnings report could potentially offset some of the negative sentiment, the pre-earnings downgrade creates considerable uncertainty, increasing the likelihood of a short-term price decrease. The consensus from previous models also leans heavily towards a price drop, which I weigh significantly in this prediction. While there's always a chance for a positive surprise in the earnings report, the immediate impact of the downgrade is likely to lead to a drop.  The probability of a price rise is reduced by the significant negative sentiment surrounding the downgrade.  Therefore, using previous predictions as a weighting factor, the higher probability remains on the stock price falling, but adjusted slightly upward from the previous predictions due to the possibility of positive news in the upcoming earnings report.

The mention of a significant software update (iOS 18.3) that supports Starlink features is likely to be positively received among consumers and investors, suggesting a strong potential for market interest. Additionally, T-Mobile reported strong earnings, which is likely a positive indicator for the partnership's success. Given this context, I estimate a higher probability of Apple's stock price rising, while the likelihood of falling is lower due to this positive news."

The integration with Starlink is potentially a long-term positive, suggesting innovation and future revenue streams. The iOS 18.3 update supporting Starlink features is a concrete positive development. The overall market sentiment and how investors perceive the value of Starlink integration will play a crucial role."

The integration of Starlink connectivity into iPhones via the iOS 18.3 update is a positive development, potentially boosting sales and attracting new customers. This is a significant technological advancement that could enhance the user experience and Apple's competitive edge. However, the news mentions this alongside other unrelated stories about other companies, and lacks specific details about the market impact of Starlink integration on sales figures.  Therefore, while the Starlink integration is positive, its impact on the stock price isn't immediately clear and needs further market reaction, so the probability of a rise is moderate. There is no negative news directly related to Apple in this specific report; hence, the probability of a fall is low."

However, the news does not provide immediate financial impact details. On the other hand, T-Mobile exceeding Wall Street expectations could positively influence investor sentiment. Since the news directly relates to Apple's activities with Starlink but does not provide clear financial indicators, the stock movement probability is relatively neutral.

The integration of innovative technology like Starlink could attract more users and potentially boost sales, thus positively impacting investor sentiment. Additionally, T-Mobile's strong earnings may contribute to a favorable view on partnerships involving Apple. There are no direct negative news impacts on Apple, making it reasonable to expect a higher probability of stock price rise.

This is a positive development, potentially enhancing user experience and creating a 'wow' factor for consumers. The fact that it's integrated in 'images, music, and podcasts' indicates it's more than just a gimmick and offers real functionality. T-Mobile's strong earnings further reinforce the narrative of successful integration, at least from the telco side. Considering the consistently positive appraisals from the previous rounds which hover primarily between 60% and 75%, and the lack of negative information relating to Apple, I'll lean slightly more positive than neutral, while also acknowledging that real impact needs time to become apparent."

The Starlink integration, supported by the iOS 18.3 update, is a significant technological advancement that could enhance the user experience and attract new customers.  While the long-term impact needs to be seen, it's a positive development. The previous predictions largely agree on a higher chance of a price increase, ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. The strong T-Mobile earnings, though indirectly related, contribute to a positive overall market sentiment which may benefit Apple as well.  However, the lack of concrete immediate financial implications of the Starlink integration and the overall vagueness of the news piece prevent assigning an extremely high probability to a price increase.  Therefore, I assign a moderate probability of price increase, slightly higher than the probability of a fall due to the lack of any negative news directly impacting Apple. "

However, the immediate financial impact is unclear. T-Mobile's strong earnings provide a positive indirect effect.  The previous predictions consistently favored a price increase, ranging from 0.55 to 0.78 probability of a rise.  While there's no direct negative news about Apple, the lack of concrete short-term financial details prevents assigning an extremely high probability to a price increase.  Considering the overall positive sentiment, the potential for future revenue streams from Starlink integration, and the consistent positive predictions from various models,  I am assigning a higher probability to a price increase, but acknowledging the uncertainty."

        "content": "The fourth-quarter earnings season is underway, and the so-called \u201cMagnificent 7\" companies are in focus. The \u201cMag 7,\u201d the stock market darlings, have soared on the AI craze. \r\n\r\nThe seven stocks are Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Tesla TSLA and Meta Platforms META. Among the seven, Tesla, Microsoft and Meta Platform will be the first to report, with their releases scheduled after market close today. Apple is scheduled to report on Jan. 30, followed by Alphabet on Feb. 4 and Amazon on Feb. 6. NVIDIA is likely to report later next month.Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFourth-quarter earnings of the Mag 7 companies are expected to be up 20.9% from the same period last year on 12.2% higher revenues. This would follow the 32.9% earnings growth on 15.4% higher revenues in the third quarter. Per Bloomberg Intelligence, profits of the Mag 7 are projected to increase by 22% in the fourth quarter from a year earlier, the smallest jump since the first quarter of 2023.\r\n\r\nSee the Zacks Earnings Calendar to stay ahead of market-making news.\r\n\r\nTesla\r\n\r\nTesla has an Earnings ESP of +1.68% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they\u2019re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nThe electric carmaker saw a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings indicates substantial year-over-year growth of 4.2% and revenue growth of 9.3%. The earnings track record of the company is moderate as it delivered a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 0.13%. The electric carmaker has gained about 55% in the past three months.\n\nTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseTesla, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nTesla, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Tesla, Inc. Quote\n\nTesla has made a solid comeback, especially after Trump's election victory, and reclaimed its trillion-dollar market cap. The EV maker is expected to benefit from Musk's proximity to Trump's administration during its second term. Trump's administration could help expedite regulatory approval for new versions of Tesla's self-driving software and for its autonomous \"robotaxis\" to hit the road.\r\n\r\nHowever, Tesla stock took a hit when the company missed estimates for fourth-quarter deliveries and recorded its first year-over-year decline in full-year vehicle deliveries in the company's history. Trump recently rolled back pro-EV policies, which also weighed on TSLA shares. Tesla shares fell 5% in a month. \r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has an Earnings ESP of -2.13% and a Zacks Rank #3. This software maker has witnessed a negative earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past seven days for the second quarter of fiscal 2025. Microsoft\u2019s earnings surprise history is good, as it delivered an earnings surprise of 4.91%, on average, in the last four quarters. The company is expected to post substantial earnings growth of 6.5% and revenue growth of 10.8% in the to-be-reported quarter. Microsoft has gained about 3.5% over the past three months.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMicrosoft Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nThe world's largest software company is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI boom, courtesy of its partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI and its investments in data centers and Copilot AI applications. It has been investing billions of dollars in expanding its global network of data centers and other physical infrastructure required to develop AI technology that can compose documents, make images and serve as a lifelike personal assistant at work or home.\n\nIn the latest development, Microsoft plans to spend $80 billion in fiscal 2025 on constructing data centers designed for artificial intelligence workloads. Over half of this spending will be focused on the United States, according to a blog post by Brad Smith, Microsoft vice chair and president.\r\n\r\nThough Azure growth will continue to slow down, Microsoft expects its AI business to be on track to bring in more than $10 billion in sales sometime in the coming quarters. Microsoft expects revenues of $68.1-$69.1 billion for the fiscal second quarter of 2025, implying 10.6% growth at the mid-point.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has an Earnings ESP of +6.74% and Zacks Rank #3. The social media giant saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 15 cents for the fourth quarter over the past seven days. Analysts increasing estimates right before earnings \u2014 with the most up-to-date information possible \u2014 is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the yet-to-be-reported quarter indicates substantial year-over-year earnings growth of 29.5%. Revenues are expected to increase 17.1% year over year. Meta Platforms delivered an earnings surprise of 11.34%, on average, in the last four quarters. Shares of META have gained about 14% over the past three months.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMeta Platforms, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMeta received a price target boost from a couple of analysts ahead of its earnings release. Wedbush raised the price target for the stock from $680 to $700 and BofA Global Securities lifted the price target to $710 from $660.\r\n\r\nThe world\u2019s largest social media platform expects to post revenues in the range of $45-$48 billion for the fourth quarter. However, Meta expects a \u201csignificant acceleration\u201d in infrastructure spending this year as it continues to pour money into developing AI. Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg pledged to spend significantly on infrastructure and other projects like the metaverse and AI-powered glasses. Meta plans to invest around $60 to $65 billion in AI in 2025, up from $40 billion spent in 2024. Management also plans to launch its own GPUs by the end of the year. \r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple has an Earnings ESP of -1.51% and a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell). Apple saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter of 2025. The iPhone maker has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 5.05% in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a modest year-over-year increase of 8.3% for earnings and 3.7% for revenues. The stock has gained about 4% over the past three months.\n\nApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseApple Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nThe iPhone manufacturer rolled out the first wave of Apple Intelligence applications on Oct. 28 and the second wave on Dec. 11. Since both AI applications are only for English-language users, these features haven\u2019t boosted sales of iPhone 16 handsets.\u00a0 As such, Jefferies downgraded Apple to underperform, which was rare. Apple expects to add AI features in other languages starting in April.\r\n\r\nOn the last earnings call, Apple offered weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. It expects \u201clow to mid-single digit\u201d sales growth. \r\n\r\nAlphabet \r\n\r\nAlphabet has an Earnings ESP of +5.96% and Zacks Rank #3. It saw no earnings estimate revision over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The company\u2019s earnings surprise track record over the past four quarters is good, with the average being 11.84%. Earnings are expected to increase 29.3%, while revenues are expected to grow 12.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Internet behemoth has gained 12% in the last three months.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAlphabet Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGoogle is facing headwinds from antitrust lawsuits and intensifying competition in the AI space. Analysts are concerned about the impact of generative AI on Google's core search business.\r\n\r\nAmazon\r\n\r\nAmazon has an Earnings ESP of +8.62% and a Zacks Rank #2. The stock saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates a year-over-year earnings increase of 52.5% and substantial revenue growth of 10.1% in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, Amazon\u2019s earnings surprise history is impressive, with the four-quarter average surprise being 25.85%. The stock has risen 23.6% in the past three months.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmazon.com, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nAmazon recently soared to new all-time highs, given its continued dominance in e-commerce and expanding footprint in cloud computing, advertising, and various other sectors. Amazon\u2019s AI business, already up by triple-digit percentages, is growing much faster than the cloud business at a comparable stage of evolution. The world's largest online retailer expects revenues in the range of $181.5-$188.5 billion for the fourth quarter of 2024. \r\n\r\nLike other tech companies, Amazon has been ramping up investments in data centers, chips and the power needed for AI workloads.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Despite a historical track record of positive earnings surprises, Apple's current metrics reveal a slight deterioration with a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%) and a sell rating (Zacks Rank #4). The projected earnings growth of 8.3% is modest compared to peers, which could limit upside potential. Furthermore, the weak sales guidance provided by Apple and downgrades from analysts could put downward pressure on the stock ahead of the earnings release. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than that of a rise."

While the overall outlook for the group is positive, with expected earnings growth, Apple's specific situation presents a more nuanced picture. Apple has a Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) and a negative Earnings ESP (-1.51%), suggesting a higher probability of missing earnings expectations.  Further, the article highlights concerns regarding the limited impact of its new AI applications and weak sales guidance for the fiscal first quarter. While Apple has historically shown strong earnings surprises, these negative indicators outweigh the general positivity surrounding the tech sector. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is assessed to be higher than a rise, although not overwhelmingly so, given Apple's overall strong brand and market position."

        "content": "Reddit (RDDT) is climbing 2% this morning after rallying nearly 8% yesterday. In a note to investors yesterday afternoon, investment bank Piper Sandler contended that a technical update by the social media firm may enable it to attract more advertisers.\n\nReddit's Update Could Be Significant\n\nThe company has made it easier for marketers to replicate on Reddit the ad campaigns that they're using on Meta (META), Piper Sandler analyst Thomas Champion explained. As a result, the number of firms advertising on Reddit could meaningfully increase, Champion asserted. Such a development, in turn, could cause the firm's revenue growth to accelerate, the analyst wrote.Evercore ISI Maintains \"Outperform\" Rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Sees AI Benefits Driving Future Growth\n\nA close up of a user's hand scrolling through a mobile social media application.\n\nAnother Investment Bank Was Recently Bearish on RDDT\n\nIn a note to investors on Jan. 22, investment bank Roth Capital downgraded the stock to Neutral from Buy. The investment bank predicted that the company's revenue growth would decelerate in upcoming quarters, and it expects RDDT's EBITA margins to drop over the next year.\n\nAdditionally, Roth predicts that the company's user growth will slow this year after it added a record number of users in 2024. It placed a $195 price target on RDDT.\n\nThe Recent Price Action of RDDT\n\nIn the last month, the shares have advanced 20%, while they are up 70% in the last three months.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of RDDT, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than RDDT but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD ALSO 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock\n\nDisclosure: None.

While this news does not directly impact Apple's stock, the context suggests increased engagement on social media platforms may indirectly benefit companies like Apple, especially in advertising and app monetization. Given the positive sentiment surrounding Reddit, one could infer that investors' confidence in tech stocks, including AI-related companies like Apple, may rise. However, there is also a bearish note from Roth Capital that suggests potential revenue slowdowns for RDDT, which could create volatility in tech stocks overall. This uncertainty warrants a cautious viewpoint, leading to a moderate estimate for both upward and downward movement for Apple\u2019s stock price."

The overall lack of direct news related to Apple and the ambiguous nature of the Reddit-related news results in a prediction that strongly favors neutrality.  While some models pointed to slight upward movement due to general positive sentiment in the AI sector and the Evercore rating, the majority of previous predictions lean towards neutrality.  Considering the limited direct information about AAPL, I assign a near-neutral probability for both upward and downward movements, with the probability of rise slightly higher due to the positive rating.

Numerous analyst downgrades reinforce this negative outlook. While a recent two-day rally provided a temporary boost, it seems overshadowed by the consistent negative data and analyst sentiment surrounding the stock. The upcoming earnings report introduces uncertainty, but the overall bearish climate suggests a higher probability of a negative market reaction. The consensus from previous predictions consistently points toward a higher probability of a stock price decline, generally above 0.65. Although there's a slight trend of some models inching towards a more positive outlook, the dominant sentiment remains negative. I am slightly more optimistic than the average consensus; the earnings are a wildcard and could beat expectations. China's Deepseek could offer a better avenue to market in China. Furthermore, Apple's products still have strong branding and consumer loyalty. Taking these factors into account, there's a reasonable chance that the probability of rising is not too low."

The consistent downgrades from various financial institutions, citing declining iPhone sales (particularly a significant drop in China), and the lack of compelling new AI applications, create strong headwinds. While a recent two-day rally and the emergence of DeepSeek offer some counter-narrative, the weight of negative analyst sentiment and poor sales data overshadow these positive factors. The upcoming earnings report introduces further uncertainty, but the currently dominant bearish sentiment increases the likelihood of a negative reaction, even to a moderately positive report. Although some models show a slightly higher probability of a price rise (hovering around 0.35-0.4), the trend across all models shows the probability of a price fall consistently higher, generally above 0.6 and frequently near 0.7.  My prediction incorporates this consensus, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in the market, but leaning towards the more prevalent bearish outlook.  The slight upward creep in the probability of a price rise across multiple rounds of predictions suggests some residual optimism might be uncaptured by the purely negative news. I will therefore adjust my probabilities slightly higher for the rise and lower for the fall, based on this creeping optimism."

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best American Stock to Buy and Hold in 2025?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Best American Stocks To Buy and Hold in 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025.\n\nWill the Market Continue To Be Bullish in 2025?\n\nWall Street\u2019s outlook for the stock market in 2025 reflects a cautious optimism following two consecutive years of substantial gains. Analysts predict continued growth, however at a more moderate pace compared to the explosive increases of 2023 and 2024. According to a report by CNN, published on January 1, strategists anticipate a 14.8% increase in the S&P 500 for 2025, which is significant but lower than the previous years\u2019 performances. The Index saw gains of approximately 23% in 2024 and 24% in 2023. As per the report 2025 marks a return to typical growth rates after an extraordinary period of high returns, which has not been seen since the late 1990s.\n\nWhile several factors are expected to contribute to the market growth, there are potential risks that can hinder it. One of the key factors contributing to growth is the anticipated business-friendly policies under President-elect Donald Trump. Dan Ives, who is a technology senior analyst at Wedbush Securities in his December 30 note mentioned his expectations that tech stocks can rise 25% in 2025 due to less regulation under the Trump administration. The analyst has picked Technology and Artificial Intelligence (AI) stocks as his best performers for the year.\n\nOn the other hand, there are potential risks that could negatively impact the stock market. For instance, the uncertainty surrounding Trump\u2019s policy decisions may create a volatile environment for markets. Traders are particularly wary of how proposed tariffs could affect economic stability and investor confidence. David Sekera from Morningstar emphasizes that the implementation of tariffs is a significant wildcard that could sway market performance in either direction. We recently covered the analysis of Jurrien Timmer, Director of Global Macro at Fidelity Management & Research Company in our article titled, 12 High Growth International Stocks to Invest in Now. Here\u2019s a piece from our coverage:\n\n\u201cWhile talking about large-cap stock performance, Timmer raises the question of whether this trend of narrow leadership will persist. He suggested that trends continue to move in the same direction until a significant change occurs. Given that large-cap growth stocks have dominated for years, it is reasonable to assume that they may continue to lead. However, he also cautioned the investors that as per the concept of mean reversion, asset prices will eventually return to their historical averages and when this happens, it could lead to sharp corrections in stock prices. Timmer believes that while 2024 was a \u201cGoldilocks year,\u201d for earnings and valuations, this year can be a tussle between higher earnings and rising long-term interest rates, thereby resulting in a volatile market.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo get the list of the 10 best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, we used Insider Monkey\u2019s third-quarter hedge funds database. Using the database we ranked the top 10 American stocks in ascending order of the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best American Stock To Buy and Hold in 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is an international provider of smartphones, personal computers, and other technology gadgets. Based in America, the company is renowned for its iPhone, Mac, and iPad. On January 27, Rosenblatt Securities reiterated their Buy rating on the stock, keeping the price target of $262. The firm expects the ongoing December quarter to be a bit low due to slower sales of the iPhone as it continues to face challenges from other Chinese manufacturers.\n\nManagement has been proactive in dealing with this competition. They released Apple Intelligence in June last year. The new artificial intelligence will be integrated with upcoming models to enhance user experience and act as a competitive edge over its competitors. Moreover, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has also shifted its focus on the Apple Store and its services revenue stream. As a result, the company was able to generate a record $25 billion in fiscal fourth-quarter revenue of 2024, indicating a 12% increase year-over-year.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy viewed Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock positively due to investor enthusiasm for its AI roadmap and iPhone 16 launch. Here\u2019s what it is said regarding the company in its Q3 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was strong in the quarter as investors viewed the company\u2019s generative AI roadmap and iPhone 16 product cycle positively. The market was reminded of the strength of the Apple ecosystem as management demonstrated how generative AI solutions would be integrated into its iOS 18 operating system, which was broadly released in the iPhone 16 late in calendar Q3. We believe Apple\u2019s generative AI-enabled products should spur a meaningful iPhone upgrade cycle and create new avenues of monetization through its app store and advertising offerings. We believe this will support intrinsic value growth that will range between high single digits and low double digits over our investment horizon.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 7th on our list of best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL to grow, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Furthermore, the article highlights a preference for AI stocks over Apple, suggesting that the article's authors believe AI stocks have greater potential for growth. The overall market prediction is for moderate growth, not the explosive growth of the previous two years.  Considering these mixed signals, assigning a higher probability to a price rise is justified by the strong fundamentals and positive analyst ratings.

On the positive side, Apple is ranked 7th among the best American stocks to buy and hold in 2025, with strong hedge fund interest (158 holders). Analysts like Rosenblatt Securities maintain a Buy rating with a $262 price target, and the company's focus on AI integration (Apple Intelligence) and services revenue has shown promising results, including a 12% year-over-year increase in fiscal Q4 2024 revenue. Additionally, investor enthusiasm for the iPhone 16 launch and AI roadmap is noted. However, challenges such as slower iPhone sales due to competition from Chinese manufacturers and broader market risks (e.g., potential tariffs and policy uncertainty under the Trump administration) introduce volatility. The overall market outlook for 2025 is cautiously optimistic, with moderate growth expected. Given these mixed signals, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the sentiment remains balanced with moderate optimism."

        "content": "ASML (ASML) stock rose as much as 5% in premarket trading after the Dutch semiconductor equipment company posted better than expected fourth quarter earnings and its CEO dismissed concerns that DeepSeek's latest breakthrough would hurt demand for AI chips.\n\nASML invented the technology required to make the world\u2019s most advanced artificial intelligence chips and is the only manufacturer of the complex machines \u2014 that latest version of which cost nearly $400 million \u2014 that use its EUV lithography technology.\n\nASML sells its machines to chip manufacturers such as TSMC (TSM), which uses its machines to produce chips for Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), and other tech heavyweights.\n\nThe Dutch firm on Wednesday reported earnings per share of \u20ac6.85, ahead of the \u20ac6.68 expected, and its quarterly revenue of \u20ac9.2 billion topped the \u20ac9 billion forecast, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates.\n\nASML\u2019s 2025 first quarter sales forecast also surpassed expectations, with its guidance range of \u20ac7.5 billion to \u20ac8.0 billion ahead of the \u20ac7.2 billion consensus estimate, per Bloomberg.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(ASML)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\n\"Consistent with our view from the last quarter, the growth in artificial intelligence is the key driver for growth in our industry,\u201d said CEO Christophe Fouquet in a statement.\n\n\"It has created a shift in the market dynamics that is not benefiting all of our customers equally, which creates both opportunities and risks as reflected in our 2025 revenue range.\u201d\n\nASML\u2019s results were under more scrutiny than usual after its prior quarterly earnings came in far below expectations and sent its stocks \u2014 and those of other chipmakers \u2014 tumbling.\n\nShares have been under pressure in recent weeks amid announcements of more restrictive export controls from the Netherlands and the US seeking to disrupt China\u2019s access to advanced semiconductors.\n\nWhile ASML has never been permitted to export EUV lithography machines to China, its sales of other equipment to the region have surged in recent years. ASML\u2019s revenue from China surged to roughly \u20ac9 billion in 2024 from \u20ac6.4 billion the previous year, per Bloomberg data.\n\nThe stock tumbled this week as news of a cost-effective AI model from Chinese firm DeepSeek cast doubt on the ultra-high spending from Western big tech companies on AI infrastructure, such as semiconductors made by ASML\u2019s machines.\n\nFouqet dismissed those concerns in an interview with CNBC Wednesday.\n\n\u201cA lower cost of AI could mean more applications,\" Fouqet said. \"More applications means more demand over time. We see that as an opportunity for more chips demand.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nCEO of Dutch tech giant ASML, Christophe Fouquet speaks during the presentation of the company's quarterly and annual results in Veldhoven on January 29, 2025.

While ASML is not Apple, it's a critical supplier to companies like TSMC, which in turn makes chips for Apple. The news highlights increased demand for AI chips, which is positive for Apple as it relies on these chips. ASML's CEO dismissing concerns about DeepSeek potentially reducing demand is also a positive signal. Previously poor ASML results negatively impacted the market, so these positive results should have the opposite effect, albeit indirectly. This coupled with the rise of ASML stock in response, suggests a more positive outlook for Apple. There will be a slight negative consideration that Apple has no direct involvement in the news itself, so the impacts cannot be too large. Therefore the probability of Apple's stock price rising is moderately favorable."

While the news is positive for ASML, Apple's (AAPL) direct involvement is limited to being a customer of TSMC, which uses ASML's equipment.  Therefore, the impact on AAPL's stock price is indirect.  A positive outlook for ASML suggests a generally positive sentiment towards the semiconductor industry, which *could* indirectly benefit AAPL. However, the connection is weak, and other factors impacting AAPL's stock price are far more significant. The news doesn't directly address any Apple-specific factors, and the indirect relationship is tenuous.  Therefore, the probability of a price change in AAPL due to this news alone is low, with the probability of no change being significantly higher."

        "content": "Jan 29- Shares of Tech Gaint Apple (AAPL, Financial) remained low on early trading on Wednesday, losing 1.5%share value after Oppenheimer downgraded shares from \"Outperform\" to \"Perform\", saying longer-term prospects are weaker than previously expected on iPhone sales projections that have come in weaker than polled estimates and increasing competition in China. The firm also tweaked its view on Apple's valuation and short-term growth prospects, cutting its previous $250 price target due to worries about the firm.\n\nThe EBITDA margin, however, climbed year on year, and Oppenheimer cut the fiscal year 2026 earnings per share (EPS) estimate by 4% to $7.95, below the consensus estimate of $8.23. Firm drops Apple revenue forecast to $438 billion in FY26 from $456 billion. The revisions were blamed on iPhone demand slowdown, and analysts lowered their projected shipment growth for FY25 to 2% from 5% and kept an outlook of 2% for FY26.\n\nApple's falling market share in China is a major concern: iPhone shipments in Q4 dropped 25%, and the full year 2024 fell 17% for the iPhone, Canalys said. With local Android manufacturers pressuring Apple's dominance, market share dropped from 19% to 15%.\n\nApple will likely struggle to maintain premium valuation and revenue momentum in the years ahead as it battles with competitive headwinds and sluggish iPhone sales, analysts warn.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The lowered price target and revenue forecast further reinforce this. The 25% drop in iPhone shipments in China for Q4 and a 17% drop for the full year 2024 is alarming, highlighting a loss of market share.

The news highlights significant concerns: slowing iPhone sales, particularly a dramatic 25% drop in Q4 iPhone shipments in China and a shrinking market share there.  Increased competition from local Android manufacturers further exacerbates the situation. While the EBITDA margin increased, this positive factor is overshadowed by the substantial negative impacts of reduced revenue projections and slowing growth. The overall picture painted by the news is one of weakening growth and increased competitive pressure, making a price drop more likely in the short-term. However, Apple remains a large and established company, and the market may react with less volatility than expected, given that some positive aspects (EBITDA increase) are present.

The consistent bearish sentiment across multiple AI models, even accounting for their distinct reasoning processes, reinforces this outlook.

Previous model predictions consistently favor a price decrease, ranging from 70% to 85%. Given the downward trend across predictions and the substantial negative news, I am more bearish.

        "content": "Investing.com - The emergence of DeepSeek could help bolster the case for investors to consider European equities, according to analysts at Citi.\n\nStock markets stabilized on Tuesday, but were roiled earlier in the week by a surge in popularity of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's AI model, which overtook OpenAI's ChatGPT as the top-rated free app on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s App Store in the US.\n\nDeepSeek said the model could compete with ChatGPT despite being made with less data and costing only around $6 million to construct. Although some have cast doubts around the claims, the announcement still raised questions around the necessity of massive AI spending plans being pursued by several mega-cap tech companies.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite slipped on Monday, weighed down by semiconductor companies who have been recently boosted by hopes around AI-driven demand. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the poster child of the AI boom, was one of the biggest decliners, erasing a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\nIn a note to clients, the Citi analysts led by Beata Manthey argued the ructions caused by DeepSeek suggest that while the enthusiasm around AI is unlikely to disappear, \"it could be evolving\". In particular, they said this trend could lead to earnings gains being less concentrated in the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" mega-cap tech companies, and even broadening out beyond the US.\n\nIndeed, the growth profile of S&P 500 members not in the \"Magnificent 7\" and the wider European market \"looks incredibly similar\", the analysts said. At the same time, valuations in the US are \"priced for perfection\", while European stocks are priced for more \"reasonable\" earnings growth expectations, they added.\n\n\"The pieces of the puzzle are coming together for better European relative performance,\" the Citi analysts said.\n\nAs a result, they view European stocks as \"the best cyclical diversifier\" in global portfolios, especially if worldwide economic growth \"stays on course this year\" and central banks continue to pursue interest rate reductions.\n\n\"[F]or global investors, the European index could be a relatively attractive proposition should returns begin to broaden away from mega-cap tech,\" they wrote.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWhat does the emergence of DeepSeek mean for European stocks?

Although DeepSeek's rise could potentially shift investor focus towards European equities, which Citi analysts deem favorable, it raises questions about the massive investments by tech giants in AI. Given that the tech market is currently experiencing volatility and the Nasdaq has shown a decline, there is a higher likelihood of downward pressure on Apple\u2019s stock in the short term. However, the long-term outlook remains stable as the overall growth of AI technology may continue to spur investor interest in the tech sector. Hence, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall in the near term due to the current market sentiment and volatility."

The article does not indicate any direct positive or negative impact on Apple; rather, it is an indirect mention. AI capabilities are already established in Apple.

The article highlights potential shifts in investor sentiment towards European equities and away from high-valuation US tech stocks. This indirect relationship means the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted.  The uncertainty makes a neutral prediction most likely.  A slight downward pressure is possible due to the overall shift in sentiment away from high-growth tech companies, but this effect is expected to be small given Apple\u2019s established market position and diversification."

While Apple is mentioned (DeepSeek's App Store success), the impact on AAPL is indirect and mostly driven by broader market sentiment.  Previous predictions show a consistently bearish to neutral outlook, with probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.55 to 0.7.  The consensus is that while Apple's fundamental business is strong, the news creates uncertainty related to the future of massive AI investment and potential sector rotation.  This uncertainty, coupled with the generally bearish sentiment reflected by the previous predictions, outweighs any potential positive impact from DeepSeek being hosted on Apple's App Store.  Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall, but less pronounced than some of the earlier predictions due to Apple's established market position and diversification."

However, some models recognize the App Store effect, which mitigates some of that concern.

The probability of a stock price fall is higher due to the overall market sentiment and the potential shifting focus away from US mega-cap tech towards European stocks.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s Stock Portfolio: 15 Stock Picks for 2025. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025.\n\nTelevision personality, financier, and entrepreneur, Kevin O\u2019Leary, also known as \u2018Mr. Wonderful\u2019 is recognized mostly as one of the panelists on the reality shows Shark Tank and Dragon\u2019s Den. In 1986, the Irish-Canadian began his business career by launching the educational software company Softkey with $10,000 from his mother\u2019s investment and leveraging the proceeds from the sale of his SET share.\n\nWhen it comes to stock investing, Mr. Wonderful seeks names that meet three criteria: They must be quality companies that boast consistently strong financial performance and a solid balance sheet. Second, he believes that a stock portfolio must be diverse across multiple market sectors. Most importantly, however, he demands income, stressing that the companies he invests in should be ones that pay dividends to shareholders. The ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF, an ETF offered by O\u2019Shares Investment Advisors, aims to encompass O\u2019Leary\u2019s strategies by holding stocks that combine all three of these characteristics. Since its launch, the ETF has returned 115.18% to shareholders. While high-risk, high-reward investments like those on Shark Tank or volatile assets like Bitcoin can be thrilling, O\u2019Leary believes that a focus on consistent, dependable income should be the basis of a sound portfolio.\u00a0 The venture capitalist summed up this view in a LinkedIn post:\n\n\u201cOUSA is part of the S&P 500, cherry-picking the highest quality balance sheets with positive cash flow from around 100 out of the 500 names. Then there\u2019s OUSM, which grabs the Russell 2000 and weeds out the underperformers \u2013 those companies not making any real dough. Forget Shark Tank, forget Bitcoin. Sure, I\u2019ve got a 5% stake in Bitcoin and another 5% in gold, but the meat of my US portfolio? It\u2019s in OUSA or OUSM.\u201d\n\nThe Race for TikTok\n\nFormer president Joe Biden recently signed a bipartisan bill that deemed TikTok a national security threat and required Bytedance, the platform\u2019s Chinese parent company, to either sell or divest from the platform completely in order for the social media platform to remain available in the United States. During a recent appearance on Fox News\u2019 \u201cAmerica\u2019s Newsroom\u201d, Kevin O\u2019Leary claimed to have made an offer of $20 billion in cash to TikTok\u2019s owners to purchase the platform, saying \u201cRight now, $20 billion is on the table, cash, cash, $20 billion.\u201d However, he added that the federal government wasn\u2019t able to verify whether the data of American account holders was actually being shared with Chinese leaders. That said, he believes the risk wasn\u2019t worth it. Moreover, in light of the dwindling timeframe, he said that companies are weighing the risks of maintaining the app\u2019s availability in the U.S., while keeping in mind the potential penalties for any provider who permits access beyond the cutoff date.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cAs of midnight on the 19, any service provider \u2026 that could be an Apple, that could be an Oracle, it could be a video compression technology company that\u2019s being paid as a consulting service, any of them that keep this thing alive is subject to $5,000 a day fine times 170 million. That\u2019s over a billion dollars a day.\u201d\n\nOur Methodology\n\nO\u2019Leary typically favors equities of well-established, financially stable companies with strong balance sheets and a history of consistent dividend growth. The following holdings are the top 15 from the ALPS O\u2019Shares U.S. Quality Dividend ETF (BATS:OUSA).

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), a multinational technology company, is well-known for its flagship products, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive suite of services, including Apple Music and iCloud. With approximately 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, the company has a sizable platform from which to launch its AI services.\n\nBernstein raised its price target for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) from $240 to $260 as part of its 2025 IT hardware industry forecast and maintained an Outperform rating on the company\u2019s stock. The company sees the names in its coverage universe primarily as trading stocks rather than long-term core holdings, and IT hardware as a \u201cstructurally challenged sector.\u201d Although many companies\u2019 portfolios are stronger than in the past, Bernstein predicts a more favorable environment for IT spending by 2025. However, it also notes that stock valuations are at the upper end of the spectrum, artificial intelligence profitability remains difficult, and it does not see much upside from a PC refresh cycle in 2025. As 2025 progresses, however, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to be one of the firm\u2019s top picks for the year.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, up 6% from the same period the year before. Product revenue increased to nearly $70 billion from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. In addition, the company distributed $29 billion to shareholders and reported $27 billion in operating cash flow.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 4th on our list of Kevin O\u2019Leary\u2019s stock picks for 2025. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                    "reasoning": "The news highlights Apple Inc. being a preferred stock pick by Kevin O'Leary, a well-known investor, which could improve investor sentiment towards AAPL. The increase in Bernstein's price target also indicates analysts' confidence in the stock, despite a competitive environment in IT hardware. Additionally, Apple has shown strong recent financial performance with increasing revenue and significant shareholder returns, suggesting stability. However, concerns about high valuations and the future of AI profitability might temper expectations. Overall, the positive mentions and analyst upgrades lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling."

                    "reasoning": "The news article is overall neutral to slightly positive for Apple. While it highlights Kevin O'Leary's potential interest in Apple, it doesn't explicitly confirm it as a top pick. The article mentions Apple's strong financials and market position, along with a price target increase from Bernstein. However, it also acknowledges potential challenges in the IT sector and suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns. The discussion of TikTok divestiture has a negligible impact on Apple's stock. Given the mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the confirmation of Apple's strong financial position and positive analyst sentiment, despite the caveats."

                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Apple's inclusion in Kevin O'Leary's potential stock picks for 2025, but this is not a strong indicator of future stock price movement.  While O'Leary's investment strategy is highlighted, focusing on quality, dividend-paying companies,  the article doesn't suggest a direct investment in AAPL by O'Leary.  The article also mentions positive factors such as Apple's strong Q4 2024 revenue, Bernstein's positive price target ($260), and the introduction of Apple Intelligence. However, these are largely already known factors and are balanced by the mention of Madison Investment's underweighting of Apple due to volatility and the assessment that other AI stocks might have greater short-term potential.  Therefore, the news itself provides only a small amount of new information likely to influence the stock price. The overall sentiment is mildly positive but not overwhelmingly so. The probabilities are skewed slightly towards a rise due to the positive revenue figures and maintained outperform rating, but the impact of this news alone is expected to be minimal."

        "headline": "Apple and SpaceX Link Up to Support Starlink Satellite Network on iPhones",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has been secretly working with SpaceX and T-Mobile US Inc. to add support for the Starlink network in its latest iPhone software, providing an alternative to the company\u2019s in-house satellite-communication service.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters Newsom Enlists Magic Johnson, Guggenheim CEO for LA Rebuilding US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years\n\nThe companies have been testing iPhones with the Starlink service from Elon Musk\u2019s Space Exploration Technologies Corp., according to people with knowledge of the matter. In an under-the-radar move, the smartphone\u2019s latest software update \u2014 released Monday \u2014 now supports the technology.\n\nThe tie-up comes as a surprise: T-Mobile has previously only specified Starlink as an option for Samsung Electronics Co. phones, such as the Z Fold and S24 models. Apple, meanwhile, already provides a Globalstar Inc. offering that lets consumers send texts and contact emergency responders when out of cellular range.\n\nT-Mobile has begun allowing customers to sign up for an early version of the Starlink service, and this week the carrier enabled a small number of iPhones as part of a beta test. In a post on X responding to the news, Musk said images, music and podcasts should be supported by current Starlink technology and future upgrades will add video support as well.\n\nThe first users received text messages from T-Mobile saying, \u201cYou\u2019re in the T-Mobile Starlink beta. You can now stay connected with texting via satellite from virtually anywhere. To start experiencing coverage beyond, please update to iOS 18.3.\u201d Users in the program have a new toggle switch in their iPhone cellular data settings to manage the satellite feature.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment, while T-Mobile said that the test will \u201cbegin with select optimized smartphones\u201d and that the full launch will \u201csupport the vast majority of modern smartphones.\u201d T-Mobile has also opened the beta to some users running Android 15, the latest version of the Google operating system. A representative for SpaceX didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGlobalstar shares fell about 11% in premarket trading in New York on Wednesday.\n\nEver since Apple teamed up with Globalstar to offer satellite features in 2022, there\u2019s been speculation over whether it might support competing networks. The day after Apple\u2019s 2022 announcement, Musk posted on X that his company has \u201chad some promising conversations with Apple about Starlink connectivity.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nHere\u2019s how it will work: When a T-Mobile iPhone is in an area without cellular connectivity, devices that are part of the Starlink program will first try to pair with SpaceX satellites. Users will also be able to activate texting via the satellite menu for the Globalstar service or contact emergency services through Apple.\n\nThe initial version of Starlink is exclusively for texting. But SpaceX and T-Mobile have said that they plan to expand into data connections and voice calls in the future. The program also is only available in the US for now. That contrasts with Apple\u2019s Globalstar service, which works in several countries. SpaceX is looking to expand Starlink to other carriers globally.\n\nThere\u2019s another major difference between the two services. The current Apple feature requires users to point their iPhone to the sky to find a satellite. The Starlink option, meanwhile, is designed to work automatically \u2014 even when the phone is in a customer\u2019s pocket.\n\nBoth the Starlink and Apple satellite features are designed to work in off-the-grid areas, such as hiking trails, that don\u2019t have cellular service. The capabilities can\u2019t be used in places where a mobile-phone network is within reach. Support for the Apple feature is available on most current iPhone models and the company plans to bring it to its Ultra smartwatch later this year, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nT-Mobile updated its website this week to tell beta testers that the iPhone is supported as part of the iOS 18.3 software release. As of now, the number of users in the beta is minimal, with T-Mobile planning to expand the program in February. Apple\u2019s announcement of iOS 18.3 touted AI features and bug fixes, but it didn\u2019t disclose the Starlink support.\n\nSpaceX requested authority to begin beta-testing the service starting Monday. The Federal Communications Commission granted SpaceX conditional approval for its satellites to supplement T-Mobile\u2019s cellular network in November.\n\n--With assistance from Loren Grush.\n\n(Updates with Globalstar premarket shares in the seventh paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWhat America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Indy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                    "reasoning": "This news is mixed but generally positive for Apple. It introduces a new feature (Starlink connectivity) that could be attractive to users, especially in areas with poor cellular coverage, giving Apple a competitive edge. The fact that it was kept secret and then rolled out suggests a strategic move to gain an advantage. The negative aspect is the potential dilution of Apple's existing Globalstar partnership, as Globalstar's stock already fell in response. However, the expanded connectivity options, combined with future capability for data and voice , suggests long term value. Furthermore, the support for iPhones on T-Mobile Starlink Beta test can encourage and support expansion to other carriers globally. Considering these points, it's more likely than not that this news will have a positive, but not overwhelmingly positive, effect on Apple's stock price. Investors will be intrigued by the added functionality, but also cautious about the impact on the Globalstar partnership. Given the negative reaction from Globalstar, it is possible for the stock price to fall on the news as well."

                    "reasoning": "The news of Apple integrating Starlink satellite technology into iPhones through a partnership with SpaceX and T-Mobile is potentially positive for Apple.  This expands Apple's satellite communication capabilities beyond its existing Globalstar partnership, offering a more advanced and potentially more widely usable service (automatic connection, future data/voice capabilities).  The surprise nature of the announcement and the positive reaction from Elon Musk on X suggest a potential for increased customer interest and brand enhancement. However, the current limited beta test and geographical restrictions (US only initially)  temper the immediate impact.  The negative impact on Globalstar's stock price suggests some investors view this as a competitive threat, albeit a limited one at this stage, which may somewhat dampen enthusiasm for Apple, but likely less than the overall positive sentiment.  Therefore, a slight increase in Apple's stock price is more probable than a decrease, but the effect is expected to be modest because of the phased rollout and current limitations of Starlink integration."

The limited beta test and geographical restrictions temper the immediate impact. Observed trend from the previous rounds indicates a general consensus around 0.6 as probability of rise. In addition, the partnership is not explicit. Hence the probability is further discounted. Therefore, I predict a slightly positive movement in Apple's stock price, with a slightly reduced probability of rising with respect to the previous rounds. Given the uncertainty and mixed reactions, I will go for a moderate value. Considering the mixed nature of the news and the potential for competition, the probabilities of price rise and fall are assigned.

The previous predictions show a gradual decline in predicted probability of a price rise, suggesting the market's initial optimism is waning. There's a consensus that the long-term potential is positive, but short-term uncertainty and the negative impact on Globalstar create significant downside risk.

        "headline": "Apple's sales likely hurt by AI delays, Chinese competition",
        "content": "By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) - Apple is expected to report tepid quarterly revenue growth on Thursday as its slow roll-out of artificial intelligence features and tough Chinese competition weighed on iPhone demand during the crucial holiday-shopping season.\n\nThe company and its rivals Google and Samsung have been leaning on AI to drive sales of their devices. But Apple's latest iPhone 16 series lacked such features at launch in September and some of its AI services, including an improved Siri, are only expected later this year in some regions.\n\nApple's challenges with AI were highlighted this month when it had to pull a news-summarizing AI tool due to inaccurate headlines, which drew criticism from the BBC and other news outlets.\n\n\"AI is the new technology innovation, the fact that Apple's handsets are lagging behind on capabilities is a key reason why their competitive positioning has weakened and the company has lost market share,\" said Jane Hepburne Scott, investment manager at Aegon Asset Management, which owns Apple shares.\n\nUnder pressure from a resurgent Huawei as well as other Chinese smartphone makers, Apple saw its share of the global smartphone market narrow to 23% in the final three months of 2024 from almost 25% a year earlier, according to IDC data.\n\nThe decline was steeper in China - its third-largest market - where Apple's share fell by 10 percentage points to 17%, the data showed.\n\nAlthough the Chinese government has been offering subsidies to smartphone purchasers to boost domestic consumption, these subsidies target low- to mid-tier phones priced below $800, excluding high-end iPhones, Barclays analysts said in a note.\n\nWorries about iPhone demand have weighed on Apple shares this year, dragging them 5% lower so far in January.\n\nAnalysts expect the company to post revenue growth of 3.8% for the three months to December, Apple's first fiscal quarter, according to data from LSEG. That is well below the 6.1% growth the company posted in the September quarter, which included only a few days of new iPhone sales.\n\nSales of iPhone will likely tick up 1.9% in the first quarter, weaker than the 5.5% increase in the previous quarter.\n\nMac sales are expected to rise 2.3%, slightly faster compared with the previous three months, while iPad revenue is expected to increase by 4.2%, a slower pace than the fourth quarter.\n\nThe services business, which has in recent years outpaced growth in Apple's devices, is expected to post an increase of 12.9% in sales.\n\nLike other companies with a large global presence, Apple is also set to be hit by a stronger dollar. The U.S. dollar strengthened by nearly 8% in the final three months of 2024 amid expectations for trade tariffs from President Donald Trump.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"With more than 50% of sales coming from outside of the Americas, the strengthening U.S. dollar against the euro and yen in the December quarter could make it more difficult for Apple to report sales that are above consensus estimates,\" warned Tom Forte, senior consumer internet analyst at Maxim Group.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram and Rishi Kant in Bengaluru; Editing by Aditya Soni and Saumyadeb Chakrabarty)",

The decline in market share, particularly in China, is a major concern. However, the services segment is expected to continue strong growth.  The overall picture suggests a likely short-term negative impact on the stock price due to the weaker-than-anticipated sales and competition, but the strong services segment and Apple's brand loyalty provide a degree of support against a significant drop.

Although the services sector is expected to continue its strong growth trajectory, it's unlikely to completely offset the negative effects of the other factors. The consistent bearish sentiment expressed across multiple AI models in previous prediction rounds reinforces this negative outlook. While Apple's strong brand and robust services business offer some downside protection, the confluence of negative pressures suggests a higher probability of a stock price decline in the short term.  The market's 5% January drop already partially reflects negative expectations, limiting the potential for a sharp decline, but a further fall or sideways movement seems more probable than a significant rise."

The previous rounds of predictions all skew heavily towards a stock price decrease. Given that market worries have already dragged the stock down 5% in January, a further substantial drop might be mitigated; however, a price fall remains the most probable outcome. I will adjust the probability because the previous rounds may have priced in some negative information about the stock price.

Shares have had a rough showing in 2025 so far, down roughly 8% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500.\n\nBut can the tech titan's results push some life back into shares? Let's take a closer look at revisions and a few other key metrics to keep an eye on.\n\nEarnings & Sales Revisions Primarily Unchanged\n\nAnalysts have been quiet concerning their EPS revisions, with the $2.36 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate unchanged over recent months and suggesting 8% growth year-over-year.\n\nTop line revisions have been slightly more negative but have otherwise been stable since a downward adjustment in early November of last year. The $124 billion expected suggests 3.7% growth year-over-year.\n\nThe company's top line has remained rather stagnant over recent years. Apple's overall top and bottom line growth has been cooling for some time now, with it no longer recognized as the growth machine it used to be.\n\nKey Apple Metrics to Watch\n\nIt's critical to keep a close eye on Apple's China results, as the region has become a big thorn in the side amid a growth cooldown stemming from increased competition. The company's China revenue has fallen short of our consensus estimate in five consecutive releases, reflective of the struggles.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for China sales for the upcoming print stands at $22.1 billion, 6.5% higher than the year-ago figure and reflective of the first positive year-over-year change in several quarters.\n\nAnother key metric to watch in the release is Apple's Services results, which have regularly been robust and reached record levels throughout its latest period. The Zacks Consensus estimate for the metric stands at $26.2 billion, 14% higher than the year-ago figure.\n\nAnd last but not least, the company's iPhone results will be under heavy scrutiny. Apple has bounced back on the metric in recent quarters, as shown below, but Apple Intelligence will likely be discussed significantly.\n\nMany have remained skeptical of Apple Intelligence, and we'll likely get a good read on whether or not the technology and new features have led to greater sales. The iPhone remains the biggest top line contributor for Apple, accounting for nearly 50% of sales throughout its latest quarter.\n\nBottom Line\n\nBeloved Apple is gearing up to reveal its next set of quarterly results this week, with many other notable companies slated to report.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe stock is currently a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), reflective of bearishness among analysts. Commentary and guidance will be critical for the stock's movement post-earnings, likely dictated by the adoption rate and use of Apple Intelligence.\n\nIn addition to the iPhone's new capabilities, investors should also keep a close eye on China results and momentum within its Services segment, with the former suppressing growth over recent periods and the latter supporting it. Still, it's worth noting that China sales are forecasted to show the first positive year-over-year change in several periods.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

While there is anticipation surrounding the earnings report, analysts have maintained a consensus EPS estimate that reflects only minimal growth, with some top-line metrics trending negatively. Key metrics to watch, such as China sales, suggest a possible stabilization, but overall sentiment and the Zacks Rank of #4 indicates a prevailing bearish outlook. Therefore, the probabilities for the stock price movement favor a fall rather than a rise."

While analysts expect EPS and revenue growth, concerns remain about China revenue and the success of 'Apple Intelligence'. The stock's Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) indicates bearish sentiment. Currently, Apple stocks have already experienced a near 8% fall. The article highlights key metrics to watch during the earnings call: China sales, Services revenue, and iPhone sales influenced by 'Apple Intelligence'. Positive surprises in these areas could boost the stock, while disappointments could further depress it. Taking these factors into account, there is a higher probability for a stock price decrease."

While the company's Services segment shows strong growth, and China sales are projected to increase year-over-year for the first time in several quarters, several factors suggest caution.  The stock is currently rated a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), indicating bearish sentiment among analysts.  Concerns remain regarding Apple's overall growth, particularly in China where performance has lagged.  The success of Apple Intelligence is also uncertain and will heavily influence post-earnings stock movement. Given these mixed signals and the already negative performance of the stock in 2025, the probability of a price fall is considered higher than a price rise."

Key concerns include stagnant top-line growth, challenges in China, and skepticism around Apple Intelligence. Analysts' EPS estimates suggest modest year-over-year growth, but revisions have been largely unchanged or slightly negative. The Services segment remains strong, but China's performance and iPhone sales are critical uncertainties.

The stock's underperformance in 2025 (down 8%) further reinforces this viewpoint. While a potential recovery in China sales and strong performance from the Services segment could offer some positive catalysts and potential upside surprise, the overall lukewarm earnings revisions and scepticism surrounding 'Apple Intelligence' mean investors will be cautious. A neutral earnings release is unlikely to move the needle much and any dissapointment can cause a strong bearish swing. Incorporating a slight adjustment due to the trend of earlier increased predictions, a slightly more bearish view is still warranted."

There is a general consensus among prediction models that the stock price is more likely to fall.

        "headline": "Apple's $725 Billion Investment Is Fueling Its Growth -- and It Has Nothing to Do With Artificial Intelligence (AI)",
        "content": "It's a good time to be a bull on Wall Street. Since the start of 2023, the mature stock-driven Dow Jones Industrial Average, broad-based S&P 500, and growth-inspired Nasdaq Composite have respectively soared by 34%, 59%, and 91%, as of the closing bell on Jan. 24, 2025.\n\nInvestors haven't hurt for catalysts, with a softening in the prevailing rate of inflation, better-than-expected corporate earnings, and Donald Trump's return to the White House helping to lift equities. But topping the list of factors that have sparked this bull market rally is the ascension of artificial intelligence (AI).Image source: Apple.\n\nAlthough many of Wall Street's most-influential businesses have leaned on AI as a way to fuel their growth, one of Wall Street's biggest businesses, tech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), has put $725 billion to work elsewhere to boost its bottom line.\n\nApple is one of Wall Street's largest businesses for a reason (and AI is part of it)\n\nApple was the very first public company to top $3 trillion in market value, and as of this past weekend was the second-largest company, behind only Nvidia. Apple has consistently led Wall Street higher for years -- and its success is no accident.\n\nFor starters, the iPhone is the premier smartphone domestically. Since rolling out the first 5G-capable iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple's share of domestic smartphone sales has been 50% or higher. The ongoing upgrade of wireless networks to support 5G download speeds has led to relatively consistent demand for the company's iPhone.\n\nApple's innovation has also played a key role in sending its market cap to north of $3 trillion. This innovation includes physical products, such as the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, as well as its ongoing transformation into a platforms company.\n\nFor years, CEO Tim Cook has overseen the push to promote subscription services. By focusing on subscriptions, Apple has an opportunity to lift its operating margin, improve its already impressive customer loyalty, and smooth out the revenue peaks and valleys that often accompany major iPhone upgrade cycles. Apple's Services segment has been consistently growing by a double-digit percentage and now accounts for around a quarter of the company's net sales.\n\nLike most tech stocks, Apple is betting big on AI to power its top-and-bottom-line growth. Last year, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, which is its AI-driven personal intelligence model for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Apple Intelligence can do everything from write and summarize text to create images for users.\n\nStory Continues\n\nLastly, Apple's balance sheet is cash rich, which allows it to aggressively invest in its future.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis $725 billion investment has been crucial to Apple's profit growth\n\nWhile this confluence of factors has helped Apple become the company it is today, arguably the greatest driver of Apple's growth in earnings per share (EPS) hasn't been mentioned yet. I'm talking about Apple's single greatest investment: stock repurchases.\n\nIn 2013, Apple's board kicked off a share buyback program that quickly became the envy of the investing word. Here's a breakdown of Apple's repurchasing activity in each of its last 11 fiscal years (its fiscal year typically ends in late September):\n\n2013: $22.95 billion in buybacks 2014: $45 billion 2015: $35.253 billion 2016: $29.722 billion 2017: $32.9 billion 2018: $72.738 billion 2019: $66.897 billion 2020: $72.358 billion 2021: $85.971 billion 2022: $89.402 billion 2023: $77.55 billion 2024: $94.949 billion\n\nCollectively, Apple has bought back $725.69 billion of its shares spanning 11 years and reduced its outstanding share count by almost 43% in the process. To put this into some context, the $6.08 in EPS Apple reported in fiscal 2024 would have equated to just $3.47 in EPS if the board hadn't authorized any share buybacks.AAPL Shares Outstanding data by YCharts.\n\nAn ongoing share repurchase program serves a number of purposes for Apple. For one, as noted, it reduces the company's outstanding share count, which can increase EPS and make the company's stock more fundamentally attractive to investors.\n\nSecondly, buyback programs tend to incentivize long-term investing. When a company's outstanding share count declines by a considerable amount over time, it incrementally increases the ownership stakes of investors. When investors buy and hold, it typically reduces share price volatility, which can also make a stock more attractive to investors.\n\nAnd third, buybacks intimate that Apple's insiders (the board and management team) believe shares of their company remain attractively valued.\n\nNot even Apple's world-leading buyback program can mask these issues\n\nWith more cash than Apple knows what to do with on its balance sheet (and generated from its operations), there's no end in sight to this world-leading buyback program.\n\nBut just because Apple is buying back its shares at a breakneck pace, it doesn't necessarily mean its stock is a good value. Billionaire Warren Buffett has sold 67% of Berkshire Hathaway's stake in its top holding, Apple, over the trailing year (ended Sept. 30) -- and there are two good reasons why this selling is likely taking place.AAPL Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts.\n\nFirst off, Apple's physical product sales have stalled out for two years. Even though iPhone remains the top-selling smartphone in the U.S., stagnant sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac, and other wearables suggest consumers aren't being wowed by the company's physical products in the same way they have in the past. Though it's possible the incorporation of Apple Intelligence into iPhone, iPad, and Mac will turn these fortunes around, not even historically high inflation helped Apple grow sales of its physical product lines in fiscal 2023.\n\nThe other prominent concern with Apple is that its stock is historically pricey. Despite its aggressive share buybacks, Apple recently hit a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of more than 42, which is a level that hasn't been witnessed in 17 years. The stock market is itself pushing the envelope on the valuation front, and Apple's premium is even more pronounced.\n\nThough Apple's share repurchases are bound to continue, there's a lot of work to be done with the company's physical products before its current valuation makes sense.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, there are concerns about stagnating sales of physical products and a high P/E ratio indicating potential overvaluation. While the ongoing buybacks and services growth could provide upward momentum, the stagnant product sales and high valuation create caution among investors. Therefore, the likelihood of a stock price rise is moderate, but the potential for a fall exists due to concerns about product performance and market valuation."

While this is positive, the article also points out significant concerns:  stalled physical product sales for two years, despite the iPhone's continued dominance in the US;  a historically high P/E ratio over 42; and Warren Buffett's significant reduction of his Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple.  These negative factors outweigh the positive impact of the buybacks, especially given the current high valuation. The overall market's current upward trend due to AI and other factors is mentioned but doesn't directly address Apple's specific challenges. The buybacks may offer some support, but the fundamental issues suggest a higher chance of price correction than continued substantial growth. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is assessed as higher than a rise."

These factors suggest potential overvaluation and a risk of price correction. The previous predictions show a clear downward trend in the probability of a price rise across multiple models, reflecting these concerns. While the buybacks and strong services segment offer support, the fundamental issues regarding product sales and valuation are substantial.  The positive impact of buybacks on EPS is not enough to offset the negative sentiment surrounding product stagnation and high valuation, especially given the generally bearish trend in predictions. I've considered the overall trend of decreasing probability of a price rise in the previous rounds, lending more weight to the negative factors. The high P/E ratio is a significant concern, pointing towards potential overvaluation in the market.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is weighted higher than a price rise."

        "headline": "Tech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures ticked up on Wednesday, after stock markets stabilized in the prior session in the wake of sharp declines earlier in the week that were inspired by a new Chinese AI model. Several Big Tech names are set to publish quarterly results after the closing bell, while traders will also be keeping an eye on a Federal Reserve interest rate announcement. Meanwhile, Dutch chipmaker ASML (AS:ASML) reports solid demand in the fourth quarter and luxury goods titan LVMH unveils disappointing sales growth.\n\n1. Nasdaq, S&P futures higher\n\nNasdaq 100 futures and S&P 500 futures both inched higher on Wednesday, with investors looking ahead to key earnings from mega-cap tech companies and a Federal Reserve interest rate decision -- all while assessing the fallout from a steep sell-off earlier in the week sparked by a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek.\n\nBy 03:30 ET (08:30 GMT), the Nasdaq futures contract had gained 96 points or 0.5%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 8 points or 0.1%, and Dow futures had dipped by 34 points or 0.1%.\n\nAll three of the indices ended higher on Tuesday. In particular, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite advanced by 392 points or 2.0%, recovering some losses logged on Monday which stemmed from fears that the emergence of DeepSeek's model could render massive Big Tech spending on AI unwarranted.\n\nShares in AI-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) were among the main drivers of the Nasdaq, climbing by 8.9% following a sharp drop on Monday that wiped a Wall Street-record $593 billion off its market value.\n\n\"The consensus narrative aggressively pushed back on DeepSeek-linked negativity, [with] some dismissing the product and attendant worries about it having a detrimental impact on industry capex while others offered praise, predicting it would trigger an acceleration in demand,\" analysts at Vital Knowledge said in a note to clients.\n\n2. Tech earnings ahead\n\nFocus now turns to a raft of quarterly results from major tech industry players -- and recent stock market drivers -- this week.\n\nSoftware titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and electric vehicle maker Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are due to report after the closing bell on Wall Street on Wednesday, followed by iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on Thursday.\n\nThe four groups are all part of the so-called \"Magnificent 7\" collection of large tech firms which have underpinned strong gains in stock markets over much of the past two years.\n\nAI will likely be a central topic for analysts as they pour through the numbers, especially after Monday's DeepSeek-inspired rout in equities. Silicon Valley executives have previously stated their intent to shell out billions of dollars on developing their AI infrastructure, all in a bid to eventually monetize the nascent technology.\n\nStory Continues\n\nHowever, some doubts around the expenditures have arisen since DeepSeek's AI model, which was made with lower-capacity chips and for around a mere $6 million, shot up in popularity. Investors may be keen to hear what the tech sector's leaders have to say about the matter, analysts say.\n\n3. Fed decision\n\nThe Federal Reserve is widely expected to leave interest rates unchanged following its latest two-day meeting on Wednesday.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at ING aruged the Fed would need to see \"significant weakness\" in the American economy as well as lower inflation in order to justify cutting rates down from their current range of 4.25% to 4.5%.\n\n\"For the moment, the job market and wages are gradually cooling, but not enough for resuming easing,\" they added. According to market pricing, the conditions for a reduction will not be met until June, they noted.\n\nInstead, attention could center around Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference, with observers anticipating that he will be asked to comment on this week's stock market turmoil and the central bank's independence in the face of political pressure from U.S. President Donald Trump.\n\n4. ASML, LVMH report\n\nInvestors were buoyed on Wednesday by strong results from Dutch semiconductor giant ASML, helping sentiment following the global tech slump earlier in the week.\n\nASML's stock price soared 10% after the biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment posted much better than expected demand for its most advanced tools in the fourth quarter, even as DeepSeek\u2019s low-cost model raises concerns over AI spending.\n\nElsewhere, shares in LVMH fell 4% as sales growth at the luxury goods giant failed to impress, following a string of solid returns from rivals and recent price gains.\n\nRemy Cointreau 's (EPA:RCOP) stock also dipped after the French spirits maker said it now expects the decline in full year 2024/25 group sales to be close to 18%, at the lower end of its guidance target, citing a lack of visibility around the timing of a recovery in demand in the U.S. and worsening market conditions in China.\n\n5. Oil muted\n\nOil prices steadied Wednesday after an uptick in U.S. crude stockpiles weighed on prices, adding to global growth concerns already exacerbated by the possible impact of President Trump's sweeping tariff plans.\n\nBy 03:31 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $73.96 per barrel, while the Brent contract added 0.1% to $76.53 a barrel.\n\nUS crude oil inventories grew by 2.86 million barrels last week, according to data from the industry body American Petroleum Institute, after nine straight weeks of draws, as cold weather pushed up demand for heating and travel activity rose during the year-end holidays.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Energy, is due to release its weekly report later in the session.\n\nOil benchmarks fell to multi-week lows early this week, dented by worries over increased U.S. production, the Trump administration\u2019s plans to impose trade tariffs on major economies, and weak economic data from China.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTech earnings ahead, Fed decision, ASML reports - what's moving markets\n\nSwedish central bank cuts policy rate eying weak economy\n\nJapan to cooperate with Bessent on forex, other issues\n\nView Comments",

ASML's strong performance also suggests continued robust demand in the semiconductor sector, which bodes well for Apple's supply chain. However, looming over Apple specifically, the news mentions disappointing sales growth in the luxury goods titan LVMH. It casts slight shadows toward the demand of some premium products. The key event is Apple's upcoming earnings report and the market's reaction to it. The Fed's anticipated decision to hold rates steady is largely priced in, but Powell's commentary could influence market sentiment, but it may not directly affect Apple.

This suggests positive overall market sentiment, which could benefit Apple. However, the upcoming earnings announcement is a key catalyst for price movement. The report may be affected by the concerns around AI spending raised by the DeepSeek model and doubts about tech companies' stated billions in AI investments. The Fed's decision is mostly expected to be neutral, although the press conference could introduce uncertainty.  Overall, the market seems to be showing some resilience against the earlier sell-off but the upcoming Apple earnings report carries significant weight.

LVMH's disappointing sales growth raises concerns about demand for premium goods, and the impact of the DeepSeek AI model on tech spending remains uncertain, potentially affecting Apple's earnings report. The Fed's expected rate hold is largely neutral, though Powell's comments could influence market sentiment.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.45 to 0.65 for the probability of a price rise, and the mixed nature of the news, a balanced probability is warranted, slightly weighted towards a rise given the overall market trends and Apple's position within the 'Magnificent 7'.  The uncertainty around the earnings report is the biggest factor; while positive market sentiment and ASML's success are promising, the potential for negative surprises related to AI spending remains."

                    "reasoning": "The financial news presents a mixed but generally positive outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL). Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures are higher, indicating a rebound in tech stocks following earlier declines. Apple's upcoming earnings report is a significant event, and the company's strong position as part of the 'Magnificent 7' could bolster investor confidence. Additionally, the Federal Reserve's expected decision to maintain interest rates may provide market stability. However, concerns about AI spending following the emergence of DeepSeek's low-cost AI model and mixed performance from peers like LVMH introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors and the previous predictions, which generally lean towards a cautiously optimistic stance, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

(AAPL) is cautiously optimistic, supported by rising Nasdaq and S&P 500 futures and a rebound in tech stocks following previous declines. Apple's positioning as part of the 'Magnificent 7' adds to the positive outlook, particularly ahead of its earnings report. While concerns regarding AI spending from the new Chinese model and disappointing luxury goods sales (as indicated by LVMH) introduce some uncertainty, the anticipated Federal Reserve decision to maintain interest rates is expected to provide stability. Considering the mix of positive and negative indicators and the trend of previous predictions, which generally lean towards a cautiously optimistic stance, the probability of Apple's stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

Investors are particularly focused on earnings from companies like Apple and the overall sentiment influenced by the tech sector performances and the macroeconomic environment. Previous predictions from various models suggest a cautious but generally positive outlook due to a rebound in tech stocks, the 'Magnificent 7' effect, and the expectation of the Fed maintaining interest rates.
