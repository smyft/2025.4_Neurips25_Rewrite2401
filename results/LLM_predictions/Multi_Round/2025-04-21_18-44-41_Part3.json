        "content": "Tech stocks looked set to lead the broader market higher on Friday as a wild week for markets drew to a close. The rapid rise of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model\u2013seemingly made on the cheap\u2013triggered a brutal selloff Monday, but tech stocks have pared back some of their losses since then. Apple CEO Tim Cook said DeepSeek was probably a \"good thing\" on a call with analysts Thursday, adding that the world's largest company in terms of market capitalization has taken a \"prudent\" approach to capital spending.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments",

Apple, a major tech company, is specifically mentioned with its CEO offering a positive assessment of the situation and highlighting a prudent approach to capital spending. While the news doesn't directly announce any positive developments for Apple specifically, the broader market positivity and Cook's comments suggest a likely positive impact on Apple's stock price. The fact that the initial selloff has been partially reversed also adds to the optimism. However, there's always inherent market volatility, and external factors could influence the stock price regardless of this news.  Therefore, while a price rise is considered more likely, a certain probability of a fall is also acknowledged."

This, combined with the fact that tech stocks have already started to recover from their initial losses, leads me to believe that the stock price of Apple is more likely to rise than fall due to this news."

CEO Tim Cook's comments suggesting that DeepSeek could be beneficial reinforce a positive outlook for investors regarding Apple's competitive position. The overall sentiment leans toward optimism with many predictions reflecting a higher probability of rising stock prices given the recovery of tech stocks and Apple's stable financial stance. However, there remains a minor risk of a price fall due to market volatility and residual uncertainty from the initial selloff.

The 'prudent' capital spending message reinforces Apple's stability. Given this, and the trend in previous predictions, I expect a slightly more conservative positive movement.

The tech sector is recovering from a DeepSeek-induced selloff, and Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, offered reassuring comments, characterizing DeepSeek as potentially beneficial and highlighting Apple's prudent capital spending.  This suggests confidence and stability. The previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a stock price rise (most models predicted a probability of 0.6 or higher).  However, it's important to note that this is based on a relatively short-term assessment, external factors could influence the stock price, and any significant market shifts would impact the prediction. The consensus of previous predictions, while not definitive proof, strengthens the probability that the stock will rise. I've adjusted the probability slightly downward compared to some previous predictions, accounting for potential market volatility and the fact that Cook's statement is not explicitly positive news for Apple itself but rather reflects an overall positive market sentiment."

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures rose on Friday, driven by gains in Apple following a strong sales growth forecast, as investors focused on key inflation data expected later in the day that could influence the Federal Reserve's policy decisions.\n\nApple gained 3.4% in premarket trading after its earnings on Thursday, when executives forecast relatively strong sales growth, a sign the company would recover from a dip in iPhone sales as it rolls out AI features.\n\n\"On the whole, investors appeared reassured by guidance that revenue growth is expected in the low- to mid-single digits in the coming quarter,\" Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.\n\nThe December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to be released at 8:30 a.m. ET, with headline inflation expected to increase 0.3% month-on-month and 2.6% annually.\n\nExcluding the volatile food and energy components, the PCE price index is expected to rise 0.2%. Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments",

The overall market also shows positive movement in pre-market trading and is on track for monthly gains, further boosting the likelihood of AAPL continuing its upward trajectory.

With Apple set to report earnings soon, the market is likely being influenced by the broader volatility created by DeepSeek's revelations. Additionally, any potential weakness in earnings or guidance from Apple could lead to negative sentiment. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is elevated. Given these considerations, despite the anticipation around Apple\u2019s earnings, the overall sentiment leaning towards risk aversion may weigh heavily, hence the probability of stock price fall is higher than that of a rise."

                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). Several articles highlight the competitive threat posed by Chinese AI startup DeepSeek, which has caused broader market concerns and even a tech stock sell-off, initially a negative signal. However, Nvidia has suggested that DeepSeek will need more of Nvidia's chips, suggesting that DeepSeek's advancement is real but not detrimental to chip leaders. Meta's success indicates market appetite for AI spends. Apple is gearing up to release its fiscal first quarter results. These earnings generate uncertainty until actually released. Considering the rise of AI development (as seen with Deepseek, Meta, and others), the possibility of positive announcements from Apple is present, as they have likely built some AI strategies of their own. Given the information available, a slightly higher chance of a positive (or no) movement is indicated by the recent events. However, the market is uncertain and dependent on what actually turns out for Apple. Therefore, a slight increase is expected, if anything."

The article mentions DeepSeek's competitive AI model causing a significant sell-off in tech stocks, including Nvidia's record-setting loss. While Apple's earnings are upcoming, the overall negative sentiment surrounding the AI landscape due to DeepSeek and the related anxieties about competition and potential national security concerns, create a cloud over the market.  While Apple's performance is not directly linked to DeepSeek, the prevailing market sentiment suggests increased risk aversion.  Considering this broader negative market sentiment, and the lack of positive news directly related to Apple, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise.  The upcoming earnings announcement however might influence the stock price independently, but the overall context suggests a higher likelihood of negative price movement."

However, given the broader tech sell-off and investor caution around AI competition, there may be negative sentiment affecting AAPL.

Moreover, Apple's earnings are due, presenting the potential for positive surprises. Considering the previous round of predictions shows differing opinions and a slight lean towards stock price falling, the effect of DeepSeek and uncertainty may be diminishing. The increasing belief in the potential of Apple to leverage AI for growth is also present. Thus the stock movement trend has been reversed. Overall, given Apple's upcoming earnings, the potential to showcase AI strategy, plus the positive sentiment around AI demonstrated by Meta, the likelihood of a rise is present. However the market will be uncertain about the stock until the earnings is released. Therefore a conservative rise is expected."

Round 1 sees some models adjusting upward (Gemini 2.0-flash-001 leaning towards a rise to 0.6), while others remain bearish. There's an expectation that Apple might navigate the AI competition with positive earnings, but this is not assured. Combining the negative external environment with uncertainty regarding Apple's AI strategy suggests that a cautious perspective is warranted. The slightly higher bearish sentiment (lower prediction of rising stock price in previous turn) may indicates that there are some other potential negative information about Apple's stock price that other predictors may know. Hence, the chance of the stock price falling remains higher than rising, slightly lower than the last round."

Many previous predictions suggest a prevalence of negative sentiment influenced by DeepSeek, with most analysts leaning towards a higher probability of a price drop for Apple stocks. However, Apple's strong brand and diversified revenue streams may provide some resilience. Considering the mixed signals and the uncertainty around Apple's earnings, there is a cautious outlook towards tech stocks, including Apple."

The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, with even models initially optimistic shifting towards a more pessimistic outlook. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is considered higher than a rise.

The absence of a major positive catalyst related to AI suggests a limited likelihood of a substantial price increase solely based on this news.  However, the market is already factoring in the excitement around AI technology, and any negative news directly related to Apple\u2019s progress in AI could lead to a slight correction.

Considering the previous predictions, there's a trend toward slightly negative sentiment, with most models factoring in the tempered expectations surrounding Apple's AI progress. Several models emphasize the lack of immediate revenue drivers, leading to a cautiously negative outlook. The initial positive sentiments appear to be weakening based on the collective reasoning. Given this, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher, reflecting the market's potentially diminishing excitement and concern about the pace of AI adoption among consumers, as it directly impacts sales. I am setting price rise to 0.35. Price fall is increased to 0.65 to reflect market potential diminishing sentiment."

        "content": "On Friday, The stock price of Apple Inc. (AAPL, Financial) experienced a positive premarket increase of 3.5% after its quarterly results led to an initial decline. The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business. The future performance of Apple will be closely tracked by market analysts regarding its AI developments.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The company beat overall revenue and earnings estimates, and its future sales growth projections are positive. The growth in the services division further contributes to this optimism. However, iPhone sales declined slightly and missed analyst expectations, which poses a risk. The cautious approach to AI investments could be viewed as both a strength (indicating fiscal prudence) and a weakness (potentially missing out on AI-driven growth opportunities). Balancing these factors, the positive elements appear to outweigh the negative, leading to a slightly increased probability of a stock price rise in the short term.

Previous model predictions overwhelmingly favored a price rise (averaging around 0.7), although some acknowledged risks associated with slightly lower iPhone sales and a cautious AI strategy. The consensus view correctly interprets the overall positive tone despite some minor negatives.  While the slightly lower than expected iPhone sales could lead to some short-term correction, the positive outlook, strong services revenue growth, and the existing positive market reaction suggest the upward momentum is likely to continue in the near term. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than the average of the previous models to account for the strong pre-market reaction."

Considering the strong earnings beat, the positive outlook, robust services revenue, and the initial market reaction, the probability of a price increase is high. However, the slight miss on iPhone sales and the relatively cautious AI strategy introduce some risk of a short-term correction or consolidation.

The services division's strong performance significantly contributed to this positive sentiment, offsetting some concerns regarding slightly lower than expected iPhone sales. Apple's future guidance also remains encouraging. The previous rounds of predictions consistently show a bias towards a rising stock price, and I will reflect this trend in my prediction. Factoring in both the objective news data and the opinions of others, which may reflect other sources of information, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price increase, while accounting that there will be slight fluctuations."

The 3.5% pre-market jump reflects immediate positive investor sentiment. The cautious approach to AI, though possibly limiting future upside in that sector, is viewed favorably as a sign of fiscal prudence, especially given recent market volatility.

Considering the strong earnings beat, positive outlook, robust services revenue, the initial market reaction, and the consistent predictions of other models, the probability of a price increase is high. However, the slight miss on iPhone sales and the relatively cautious AI strategy introduce some risk of short-term correction or consolidation.

        "content": "Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

However, the positive outlook, driven by Apple Intelligence adoption, appears to be overshadowing the negative aspects in the market's initial reaction (shares rising in premarket trading). Analysts have called the results mixed and are positive about Apple Intelligence's impact on iPhone growth where available. Accounting for both positive and negative aspects, the overall sentiment, driven by the optimistic outlook, leans towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as there is also genuine uncertainty related to China revenue and slower adoption of Apple AI."

However, the positive outlook for Q2 sales growth, exceeding analyst expectations, and the positive impact of Apple Intelligence (AI features) on iPhone sales are key factors influencing the prediction.  The cautious approach to AI also seems to have shielded Apple from the recent Big Tech downturn.

The positive performance in Apple's services segment and the potential benefits of the new AI features further bolster the outlook, despite some concerns.

While the positive Q2 sales outlook, exceeding analyst expectations, and CEO Tim Cook's comments about Apple Intelligence boosting sales are strong positives pushing the stock upwards, there are significant headwinds. The drop in iPhone sales, especially the substantial decline in Greater China sales, cannot be ignored. The previous round predictions consistently lean towards a positive outlook, averaging around 0.7 for a price rise, which suggests a prevailing positive sentiment despite the mixed data. A slight downward adjustment from that prevailing positive sentiment is warranted, given the concerning China sales figures and the slight iPhone sales miss. Therefore, I will assume the probability of stock price rising is 0.65 and falling is 0.35."

The consensus among previous models leans heavily towards a price rise (around 0.7 probability).  However, I believe the significant underperformance in Greater China (a key market) warrants a more cautious outlook. While Apple Intelligence is touted as positive, its slower-than-expected rollout introduces uncertainty. The overall revenue and EPS beat are positive, but not overwhelmingly so. Considering the mixed signals and the relatively high consensus for a price rise, I am adjusting the probability slightly downwards to reflect the significant China market weakness and the uncertainty around Apple Intelligence's full impact. This is also partially influenced by the pre-market rise already reflecting some of the positive news."

Previous rounds of predictions have consistently hovered around a 70% probability of a price rise, indicating a degree of optimism already priced in.

Negatives include a slight miss on iPhone sales targets and a significant 11% drop in Greater China sales, well below projections. Analyst sentiment is described as 'mixed'.  The pre-market rise suggests the positive aspects are currently outweighing the negative ones. However, the substantial underperformance in the crucial China market warrants caution.  Considering the mixed signals and the consistent but slightly decreasing trend in previous predictions, I'm assigning a probability of stock price rise that's slightly lower than the consensus, but still leaning positive, acknowledging the potential for the negative factors to exert greater influence later."

However, the positive Q2 sales outlook, exceeding expectations, is a strong bullish signal, suggesting iPhone demand momentum. Apple Intelligence is also boosting sales where available, though rollout is slower than anticipated.  Previous predictions consistently leaned towards a price rise (around 0.7 probability), indicating a prevailing positive market sentiment.  However, the significant underperformance in Greater China, a key market, and the missed iPhone sales targets warrant a more cautious outlook than a simple average of previous predictions.  The pre-market rise likely already reflects some positive news.  Therefore, I'm slightly lowering the probability of a rise to reflect the negative factors, but maintaining a positive outlook given the strong Q2 guidance and positive aspects of the report."

        "headline": "Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

This analysis leads to a probability assessment leaning towards a stock price rise, albeit with caution regarding external factors."

The earnings beat and positive guidance for the next quarter are strong indicators that the stock price may rise.

The previous models have mostly converged around a probability of 0.6 to 0.7 for the stock price rising.

The upcoming PCE data adds to this uncertainty.  The previous predictions from various models show a consistent range, with a slight upward trend towards a higher probability of a price rise. Considering the positive earnings news as the primary driver, but acknowledging the considerable external headwinds, I am adjusting my prediction slightly downwards from the previous rounds' consensus, reflecting the inherent risk associated with the tariff threats and broader economic uncertainty."

        "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

It describes Apple's strong performance in Q4 2024, driven by product sales, and notes that BofA analysts reiterate a \"Buy\" rating, citing resilience, tailwinds, and cash flow. On the other hand, the article also mentions some negative headwinds, including Warren Buffett's overall shifted 'defensive' stance and significant cash hoard, as well as BofA analysts also predicting lower iPhone sales in the March quarter due to macroeconomic challenges and the delayed adoption for AI services.

While this is generally positive, the article also highlights several potentially negative factors.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, citing macroeconomic challenges and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple intelligence features, suggests a potential downward pressure on Apple's stock price.  Conversely, the article also mentions BofA's continued 'Buy' rating for AAPL, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, which provides support for a stock price rise. The fact that Apple is listed as only the 9th longest-held stock by Buffett also implies a lower level of conviction compared to other holdings. Overall, the article presents a mixed picture with both positive and negative factors influencing the stock price, with the negative factors possibly having a slightly stronger influence in the short-term."

Considering the trends in previous rounds' predictions, which showed a range of opinions from a slightly positive to a slightly negative outlook, and weighing the factors presented, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

Mac Revenue: $9 billion, up 16% year over year. iPad Revenue: $8.1 billion, up 15% year over year. Wearables, Home, and Accessories Revenue: $11.7 billion, down 2% year over year. Services Revenue: $26.3 billion, up 14% year over year, an all-time record. Gross Margin: 46.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially. Net Income: $36.3 billion, an all-time record. Operating Cash Flow: $29.9 billion. Installed Base: Over 2.35 billion active devices, an all-time high. Capital Return: Over $30 billion returned to shareholders, including $23.3 billion in share repurchases.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The company sets an all-time record for overall revenue and EPS, and it returned a significant amount to shareholders through buybacks. The positive growth in services revenue and the installed base of active devices further substantiate this positive outlook. However, challenges in the Greater China market and a decline in wearables may temper some optimism. Overall, the substantial positive financial results suggest a higher likelihood of stock price increase, despite the presence of some headwinds."

Apple reported record revenue and EPS, strong growth in key segments like iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Services, and a growing installed base. The company is also returning a significant amount of capital to shareholders. The introduction of Apple Intelligence is showing positive results where available. However, there are some negatives: a significant revenue decline in Greater China, a slight decline in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue, foreign exchange headwinds, and increased operating expenses. The decline in China is concerning, albeit partially attributable to channel inventory adjustments. The future impact of operating expense increase must also be monitored. The discussion of Apple Intelligence impacting upgrade cycles in markets it is available is promising for the future, as is growth in emerging markets like India. Overall, the positives outweigh the negatives, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise."

The strong performance in iPhone sales, driven partly by Apple Intelligence in available markets, is a significant positive.  However, the decline in Greater China revenue due to inventory adjustments and lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, along with increased operating expenses, presents a counterpoint.  The success in emerging markets offers a potential offset to China's challenges.  Overall, the record financial performance outweighs the negative factors, although the China market remains a concern. The positive outlook on future innovation and the robust upgrade cycle also contribute to a positive outlook.  Considering these factors, a price rise is more likely, but the uncertainty around China and expenses suggests the probability won't be overwhelmingly high."

While previous rounds of predictions largely lean towards a price increase, I feel that there are reasons for price decline based on GuruFocus warning signs and loss of the Chinese market. The high capital return to shareholders may also be seen as the company running out of ideas for innovation. The average of other predictions is about 0.75 for price rise, but I will reduce my confidence to 0.63 due to the GuruFocus warning and China revenue drop."

Record revenue and EPS are extremely positive, driven by strong iPhone sales and the consistently growing Services segment.  The massive installed base of active devices underscores customer loyalty and future revenue potential.  However, the decline in Greater China revenue (partially attributed to inventory adjustments but still significant) and the slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue are concerning. Increased operating expenses and foreign exchange headwinds further add to the complexity.  The strong performance in emerging markets, particularly India, offers some offsetting positive news, and the success of Apple Intelligence where it's launched suggests future growth potential.  Considering the overall financial health, the growth in key segments, and the emerging market potential, the positives likely outweigh the negatives in the long term. However, the short-term impact of the China market decline and increasing operating expenses can't be ignored. The consistent trend in previous AI model predictions (mostly around 70-80% probability of a rise) also factors into my analysis. The GuruFocus warning signs add another layer of caution.  Balancing these factors leads to a probability of a stock price rise that's above 0.5 but below the consistently high predictions of other models previously. I'm adjusting downward slightly to account for potential short-term market volatility and the unforeseen effects from the warning signs."

        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

An analyst downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, further contributes to negative sentiment. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it's lagging behind in generative AI applications for consumers. The article, while including Apple in a list of AI stocks, ultimately favors other AI stocks for potentially higher returns. The inclusion of Apple second place is moderately offsetting, however, the analyst downgrade will most likely have a significantly negative effect. The discussion around the Stargate initiative has limited direct relevance to AAPL. Therefore, the overwhelmingly negative tone suggests a higher probability of the stock price declining."

The Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's direct performance.  The consistent negative sentiment across previous predictions, all hovering around a 70% chance of a price drop, reinforces this bearish outlook.  Therefore, the probability of a price fall is considered significantly higher than a price rise, although the established brand and large existing market share suggests that the fall will be less severe than one might otherwise expect given the negative sentiment."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

While the initial reaction was positive, with the stock climbing 3% in late trading after the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, a deeper dive reveals underlying concerns. The 4% revenue growth to $124.3 billion was helped by services revenue which beat analyst expectations. Profit also beat analyst expectations at $2.40 a share. However, there were specific weaknesses notably, the 11% drop in China revenue and the slightly below-expected iPhone sales suggests challenges in a key market and product segment. The company's attempt to catch up to its peers in AI is another potential hurdle, as well as potential new tariffs, while a new CFO may add uncertainty. On the positive side, Mac and iPad lineups performed better than expected. The forecast of low to mid-single-digit revenue growth is in line with expectations. Overall, while the immediate sentiment is positive due to the revenue forecast and some product categories exceeding expectations, the combination of China decline, AI competition, and potential tariffs suggest limited upside."

However, the positive aspect was Apple's reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, projecting low-to-mid single-digit growth, which aligned with analyst expectations and calmed investor concerns.  While concerns remain about China, competition, and Apple's AI strategy lagging behind competitors, the positive outlook and record services revenue suggest a generally positive outlook. The immediate post-earnings stock price jump of over 3% in after-hours trading indicates a positive market reaction.  Considering this mixed bag of positive and negative factors, a rise is more probable than a fall, but significant uncertainty remains. The probability is weighted more heavily towards a rise due to the positive revenue forecast and the market's immediate positive reaction, but risks related to China, AI competitiveness and potential future tariffs must be acknowledged."

However, the reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter (low-to-mid single-digit growth), in line with analyst expectations, calmed investor nerves and triggered a significant post-market stock price surge.  This positive market reaction is a key factor.  However, persistent challenges remain:  China's economic slowdown and its impact on Apple's sales, the company's relatively slow progress in the AI race compared to competitors like Google and OpenAI, and the potential impact of future tariffs all introduce considerable uncertainty.\n\nThe consensus among the various AI models in previous rounds shows a consistent leaning towards a price rise, with probabilities generally ranging from 0.6 to 0.8.  This indicates that these models are considering factors beyond the immediate news release, perhaps including insights from other sources and analysis.  Given the mixed nature of the news and the lingering uncertainties, it's crucial to temper the optimism stemming from the immediate market response.  I'm adjusting my prediction slightly downward compared to the average of previous rounds, to account for these persistent risks while still acknowledging the positive market reaction and cautiously optimistic outlook. I'm also considering the possibility of some private information about AAPL stock possibly being available to those models, thus slightly decreasing the predicted probability of rising."

This positive market reaction is a significant factor.  The strong performance of the services division and better-than-expected results from the Mac and iPad lines also provided support.  The previous rounds of predictions from various AI models consistently show a leaning towards a price rise (mostly in the 0.6-0.8 range).  This consistency suggests these models may incorporate additional information beyond the public news release.  However, the persisting concerns regarding China, AI competitiveness, potential tariffs and macroeconomic uncertainty prevent an overly bullish outlook.  I am weighting my prediction more heavily on the immediate positive market reaction and relatively high consensus from the other models, but I am adjusting slightly downwards to account for substantial risks and incorporate both positive and negative factors.

This is a positive signal, likely to be well-received by investors. However, the market's reaction depends on many other factors, and it's impossible to predict a certain outcome with complete accuracy. We need to consider that this is just one piece of information amongst many that will influence Apple's stock price.  The probability of a price increase is higher than a price decrease because the news presents a positive outlook for future growth, but the magnitude is uncertain."

Considering this consensus, the mature company factor, and the inherent uncertainty in stock price prediction, a conservative estimate is appropriate. I'm adjusting the consensus slightly downward to account for the mature company aspect and the potential for other unforeseen market influences.

While total revenue increased by almost 4%, the slight decrease in iPhone sales (a miss compared to analyst expectations) is a negative indicator as the iPhone is Apple's most important product. The fact that AI hasn't yet driven new iPhone sales is also a concern. Overall, the slightly negative news regarding the core product outweighs the positive revenue growth in terms of its potential immediate impact on investor sentiment. This is because the market is forward looking and concerns regarding iPhone sales tend to drive quicker reactions than total revenue growth."

The news highlights the market's anticipation of an AI-driven growth spurt that hasn't yet materialized.  Investors are likely to react negatively to the missed expectations in the short term, potentially causing a price drop. However, Apple's overall financial health remains strong, and the anticipation of future AI advancements could limit the extent of the decline.  The long-term outlook for Apple remains positive due to its strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and potential for AI integration. Therefore, the probability of a price fall immediately following this news is considered higher than a price rise, but the fall is expected to be limited and potentially followed by a recovery as investors reassess the AI potential."

This is likely to negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term, despite the overall revenue growth of almost 4%. The anticipation of AI-driven growth has not yet materialized, adding to investor caution. Previous predictions consistently lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 in earlier rounds, and gradually adjusting to slightly lower probabilities (0.58-0.65) as mitigating factors like revenue growth and future AI potential are considered. Given this trend and the mixed nature of the news, the probability of the stock price falling remains slightly higher than the probability of it rising, but the extent of the decline may be limited by Apple's overall resilience."

While revenue and EPS beat estimates, and several product categories (Mac, iPad) and geographic regions (Europe, Japan) showed strong growth and exceeded expectations, the Greater China region experienced a significant decline. iPhone revenue was slightly below expectations, and Wearables, Home and Accessories also missed estimates. Overall revenue and EPS surprises were relatively small. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and underperformance relative to the S&P 500 over the past month suggest negative sentiment toward the stock.

While the company beat EPS estimates and slightly exceeded revenue expectations,  key geographic segments presented a complex picture.  Greater China revenue significantly missed estimates, offsetting strong performances in Europe and Japan.  Product sales slightly exceeded estimates, but iPhone sales were essentially flat and Wearables, Home, and Accessories fell short. Services revenue showed robust growth. Overall, the earnings beat was modest, and the geographic revenue breakdown suggests some underlying weaknesses. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further signals potential underperformance. Considering the mixed results and negative Zacks ranking, the probability of a price increase is lower than a price decrease."

Underperformance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment further adds to the negative sentiment.

This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests a positive initial response, likely because the beat on earnings outweighed the concerns about declining iPhone sales.  However, the long-term impact of the iPhone sales decline remains uncertain.  Investors will likely scrutinize future quarters to assess whether this is a temporary blip or a concerning trend.  Therefore, while the initial reaction is positive, there's a considerable chance of a correction if the trend continues or if future guidance is weaker. The probability of a rise is higher initially due to the positive earnings beat, but the uncertainty surrounding iPhone sales makes a fall a significant possibility."

The analysis of prior predictions indicates a consistent lean towards a higher probability (ranging from 0.6 to 0.75) of the stock price rise, solidifying the bullish outlook. While acknowledging the iPhone sales decline as a potential risk factor, it already appear to have been discounted by the market to some extent. The slight upward adjustment in probabilities reflects the cumulative effect of positive earnings and market reaction, balanced with a recognition of potential headwinds from iPhone sales."

The initial positive market reaction (stock price increase in extended trading) suggests that investors are currently prioritizing the earnings beat over concerns about iPhone sales.  The consensus from multiple previous prediction rounds leans towards a higher probability of a price rise (around 0.65 to 0.7).  While the positive market reaction is encouraging, the long-term impact of the iPhone sales decline remains unclear. I'm weighting the positive earnings beat and initial market reaction more heavily than the iPhone sales decline, but acknowledging the risk.  Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities slightly higher than some previous predictions to reflect this."

When questioned on the product cycle and the average life of products during Thursday's earnings call, Cook chose to focus on the opportunity ahead: \"I think it's different for different types of users,\" he said. \"And so I do think there were lots of units that are sold during the Covid period of time, and it's a huge opportunity for us as a company for more than one of the product categories.\"\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments",

The article highlights a historical three-year cycle of peak iPhone sales, which might be disrupted. Cook's response, while optimistic, doesn't directly address the cycle concern, potentially fueling uncertainty. The focus on 'opportunity' and a broad reference to Covid-era sales suggest a potential deviation from past trends, without concrete information on performance. This ambiguity carries a slightly negative outlook, increasing the probability of the stock falling relative to rising. The lack of clear information has more people expecting it to drop slightly than rise."

However, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, downplayed this concern, attributing past high sales to the COVID-19 period and emphasizing future opportunities.  This suggests a degree of uncertainty. While the missing refresh cycle could indicate weaker-than-expected sales in the near term, potentially putting downward pressure on the stock,  Cook's optimistic outlook and the company's overall strong position mitigate this risk. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the market's general tendency to react positively to Apple's news, unless evidence strongly suggests otherwise. The market may already have priced in this potential slowdown, making the impact of this news relatively muted."

Tim Cook's response suggests a focus on other product categories rather than addressing the iPhone cycle directly, which may indicate uncertainty or a shift in strategy. Investors might interpret this as a potential slowdown in iPhone sales, a key revenue driver for Apple, leading to negative sentiment.

The previous rounds of predictions show a mix of opinions, with a slight tendency towards a negative forecast, but with one outlier suggesting a higher chance of price increase. Considering the previous predictions and the indirect response of Tim Cook plus focusing on the future, the more conservative approach would be keeping the rise and fall probabilities close to each other, but with a slight increase in the probability of stock price rising, since Cook mentioning 'huge opportunity' would be the key. In this case the information is mixed."

Cook's optimistic statements and focus on broader opportunities mitigate the negative implications to some degree. The lack of specific guidance increases uncertainty.  The fact that some models foresee a higher probability of a rise, and others a higher probability of a fall, suggests that the market's reaction will be influenced by other factors such as overall market sentiment and Apple's performance in other product segments.  Considering the previous predictions' range and ambiguity of the news, a neutral stance is warranted. The significant diversity among the prior predictions suggests a relatively low degree of confidence in any single outcome.

The lack of clear guidance from Cook and the historical significance of the iPhone refresh cycle to Apple's sales performance contribute to the uncertainty, making a slight decline in stock price more probable than a rise in the short term, but still within a relatively narrow margin due to Apple's strong brand and market presence. The analysis of previous predictions and the news content suggests that while there is a potential for the stock to react positively to the emphasis on future opportunities, the prevailing concern about the disrupted refresh cycle is likely to have a more significant impact on short-term investor sentiment."

Analysis of previous predictions reveals a significant divergence of opinions, underscoring the uncertainty surrounding the market's response.  Initially, there was a slight bias towards a price fall, attributed to the ambiguity around the iPhone refresh cycle. However, subsequent rounds show a convergence towards a more neutral stance.

Apple reported earnings per share of $2.41, and net income of $36.3 billion.\n\n\u201cToday Apple is reporting our best quarter ever, with revenue of $124.3 billion, up 4 percent from a year ago,\u201d Apple chief executive Tim Cook said in a statement. \u201cWe were thrilled to bring customers our best-ever lineup of products and services during the holiday season. Through the power of Apple silicon, we\u2019re unlocking new possibilities for our users with Apple Intelligence, which makes apps and experiences even better and more personal.\u201d\n\nThe company was expected to report revenues of $124.3 billion for the fiscal first quarter, according to analysts\u2019 estimates compiled by FactSet (FDS). Apple was also expected to report earnings of $2.35 per share for the quarter ended in December, and net income of $35.6 billion.\n\nDespite being the company\u2019s \u201cbest quarter ever,\u201d Apple missed iPhone revenue expectations. The tech giant reported $69.1 billion in net sales for the iPhone, while analysts had expected $70.7 billion, according to FactSet.\n\nApple shares were up by more than 3% in after-hours trading after the company said on its earnings call it expects \u201clow to mid single digits\u201d growth on an annual basis for the March quarter. Analysts expected guidance of $95.6 billion for revenue, and $1.66 for earnings per share, according to FactSet\n\nThe company\u2019s shares were down 0.74% at the market close on Thursday, and are down by 5.1% so far this year.\n\nCook said on Apple\u2019s earnings call it will roll out more languages for Apple Intelligence in April, and that most customers are currently using artificial intelligence features such as Writing Tools and Image Playground.\n\nEarlier this month, Jefferies (JEF) analysts downgraded Apple\u2019s rating to \u201cUnderperform,\u201d citing expectations of a miss for both fiscal first-quarter results and guidance. Apple\u2019s iPhone 17 and 18 sales are expected to \u201cbe weak,\u201d Jefferies said, \u201cbecause there are limited hardware upgrades to drive adoption.\u201d\n\nThe company rolled out the Apple Intelligence features in October, which \u201chas yet to gain traction with consumers,\u201d Jefferies analysts said.\n\nFollowing Asia supply chain checks, Jefferies said it was \u201ccautious\u201d over demand for Apple\u2019s rumored iPhone SE 4, which it said is likely to launch toward the end of March. The rumored smartphone \u2014 part of the SE series of smaller iPhones \u2014 is expected to use an A18 chip that is also found in the iPhone 16, a full-screen OLED display, and have Apple Intelligence capabilities.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

The after-hours trading rise suggests an initial positive reaction to the overall record earnings and the forward guidance of \"low to mid single digit\" growth for the March quarter. However, the market had closed down for the day (-0.74% and -5.1% YTD), and the missed iPhone targets could temper enthusiasm. Furthermore, the Jefferies downgrade mentioning weak iPhone 17 and 18 sales, coupled with concerns around the iPhone SE 4 demand, creates a negative sentiment in the medium term.

The positive aspect of record earnings and exceeding expectations in other areas is counterbalanced by the negative points about missed expectations and weaker future guidance.  Considering these mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price fall, although the overall movement might be relatively modest due to the record earnings."

Analyzing the trend of previous predictions shows convergence around a nearly 50/50 split, reflecting the mixed signals. The iPhone sales miss and downward guidance now outweigh the positives, making a price fall slightly more likely.

This is compounded by a Jefferies downgrade and concerns about future iPhone sales. The initial post-earnings market surge reflects short-term optimism driven by the strong overall results, but the longer-term outlook remains uncertain due to the concerns about iPhone demand.  Analysis of previous predictions shows a range from 0.35 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, showcasing considerable uncertainty. Considering the missed iPhone sales, negative analyst sentiment, and overall uncertainty, the probabilities are nearly even.  However, the record earnings and positive (albeit moderate) forward guidance prevent an overwhelmingly bearish outlook. The overall trend suggests a slight lean towards a price fall, given the iPhone's importance to Apple's performance and the concerns raised by analysts about future iPhone models and consumer adoption of Apple Intelligence. The after-hours trading rise offers some positive counterbalance.  The consensus from multiple AI models' predictions further supports a near 50/50 probability, with a slight edge towards a price fall."

The concerns are based on three main factors: 1) skepticism about the impact of on-device AI due to non-game-changing hardware and poor user feedback on Apple Intelligence features, 2) elongating replacement cycles which could lead to lower upgrade demand, and 3) stalled share gains in China, a significant market for Apple, due to intensifying competition with domestic smartphone makers. These concerns, highlighted by a credible analyst, likely outweigh the positive earnings beat in the short term. Therefore, while there is a possibility of the stock price rising due to the earnings beat, the analyst's pointed concerns about future quarters suggest a higher probability of a price drop."

Emerging markets often present new customer bases for growth, especially as smartphone adoption increases. Therefore, the likelihood of a positive reaction to this news seems high, as investors may see the potential for increased revenues despite challenges in other regions. However, market volatility and economic uncertainty can still lead to a chance of stock price decline. Thus, I estimate a higher probability for price rise over fall."

This is a positive sign for long-term growth, as it demonstrates proactive diversification and the pursuit of new revenue streams. While this is good for long-term investor confidence, the immediate stock market reaction is likely to be muted.  The news doesn't contain any immediate concrete financial figures or announcements related to these emerging markets, so it's unlikely to cause a huge immediate price swing. The probability of a price rise is therefore slightly higher due to positive long-term implications, but the effect will likely be small and gradual rather than a sharp jump. A price fall is unlikely unless the overall market sentiment takes a downturn."

This proactive approach is likely to be well-received by investors, as it signals potential for long-term growth. However, the immediate impact may be muted due to the lack of specific financial data or concrete growth metrics. Considering the consensus from previous predictions, which lean towards a positive outlook with probabilities of stock price rise ranging from 0.55 to 0.72, and the general sentiment of the news being favorable, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising. Market volatility and execution risks in emerging markets could still pose some downside risks, but the overall sentiment is positive."

The lack of immediate financial details limits any sharp price swings.

The trend in predictions, however, shows a slight downward adjustment in the probability of a rise over multiple rounds, reflecting a more cautious optimism as the models and their analysts consider the time lag before any impacts from these new markets are realized and the lack of immediate financial data.
