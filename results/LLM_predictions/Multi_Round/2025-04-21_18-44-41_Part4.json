        "content": "Apple Intelligence isn't available everywhere, but iPhone demand is stronger where the software is live, says CEO Tim Cook. On the conference call Thursday, Cook said that the year-over-year performance on the iPhone 16 family was stronger in places where the company has rolled out Apple Intelligence than where the software isn't yet available. \"The 16 outperformed the 15,\" Cook said.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments",

This suggests positive consumer reception and potential for increased sales, which is likely to boost investor confidence. Tim Cook's comments about the iPhone 16 outperforming the previous model further support a bullish outlook. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling."

Tim Cook's statement about stronger iPhone demand in markets where Apple Intelligence is available indicates a potential driver for future revenue growth. The fact that the iPhone 16 is outperforming the iPhone 15 in these markets further reinforces this positive outlook. While the availability of Apple Intelligence is currently limited, the data suggests that its wider rollout could lead to increased iPhone sales and overall revenue. This positive sentiment is likely to encourage investors, leading to a higher probability of the stock price rising. However, market sentiment can be influenced by other factors, and the impact of this news may be limited by the current availability of Apple Intelligence."

This implies successful integration of AI features and potentially increased customer loyalty and spending. While this is positive, it's important to note that this is only one factor influencing Apple's stock price.  Other macroeconomic factors, competition, and future product announcements will also play a significant role.  The statement is also somewhat vague, lacking specific sales figures or market share data.

This suggests the AI integration is a success and could drive future growth. However, the news lacks specific quantifiable data (sales figures, market share impact, etc.), and the rollout of Apple Intelligence is limited geographically.  Therefore, while the news is bullish, the impact on the stock price is likely to be moderate.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from 0.6 to 0.75 probability of a price rise, and acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock movements, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise to account for the lack of concrete data and the potential for other market factors to influence the stock price.

However, the lack of concrete data and the influence of other market factors necessitate a degree of caution. Considering the positive sentiment, the limited data, the consensus from previous models, and the upward trend in predicted probabilities across rounds, I'm assigning a probability slightly higher than the average of previous predictions to account for the accumulating positive sentiment.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Considering the indirect nature of the news, the lack of significant positive or negative information directly related to Apple, and the overall market uncertainty reflected in the previous predictions, I predict a near-neutral probability of price movement. The slight negative market reaction to Amazon's move slightly increases the probability of a fall, but the overall impact is likely to be small.  The consistent near-neutral predictions across multiple rounds and models reinforce the conclusion that this news is unlikely to be a significant driver of Apple's stock price in either direction."

        "headline": "Futures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments",

Positive factors include the overall positive sentiment in the market indicated by higher futures, and Apple's relatively lower exposure to the AI spending concerns compared to other Big Tech companies. Baird analysts suggest Apple is well-positioned to benefit from generative AI without massive spending. However, negative factors are also present. The news mentions tepid quarterly revenue growth expectations, intensifying competition in the Chinese market, and mixed-to-poor reviews for Apple Intelligence, potentially not driving iPhone sales significantly. The Fed's wait-and-see approach to rate cuts could also dampen enthusiasm.

The tepid revenue growth forecast also casts a shadow.  The Fed's decision to hold rates steady could be seen as slightly positive, reducing uncertainty, but it's not a major factor specifically impacting Apple.  Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, but both probabilities are relatively close to 0.5, reflecting the uncertainty."

Apple's upcoming earnings report is expected to show tepid quarterly revenue growth, which could be influenced by intensifying competition in its Chinese market and lukewarm reception to its AI offerings. However, Apple is considered less exposed to the AI spending concerns compared to its peers. Given the overall positive movement in U.S. stock futures and the wait-and-see approach by the Fed, there seems to be a cautiously optimistic sentiment.

Despite concerns over the emergence of a low-cost AI model from a Chinese start-up, executives from these companies have defended their AI spending plans. Apple, which is due to report its quarterly earnings, is expected to unveil tepid revenue growth due to intensifying competition in its major Chinese market. However, Apple is less exposed to the risks associated with the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model compared to its peers, and its relatively modest capital expenditures on AI could be seen as a positive. The Fed's decision to hold interest rates steady and its wait-and-see approach to future policy moves may also have a positive impact on the stock market.

The Fed's wait-and-see approach on interest rates provides little directional guidance for Apple specifically.  The previous predictions show a consistent lean towards a higher probability of a price fall. Considering the preponderance of negative factors and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, and the consistent downward trend in previous predictions, the probability of a price fall is judged to be higher than a price rise.

        "headline": "Why Apple (AAPL) Is the Best Stock to Buy in 2025 for Beginners",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 7.90%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, wearables, accessories, and other related products and services. Its operations span across the globe. The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter. Analysts expect 2025 to be a robust year for the company, with a 6% forecasted growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, with more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, Apple Inc., (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an expansive platform for AI services. It is set to reveal several of its new Apple Intelligence features in fiscal 2025 and may explore AI-driven subscription services, which could translate to further revenue potential for the company.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\u00a020 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Apple's declining market share in China and the cautious tone of CDT Capital Management regarding AI's overhyped valuations further contribute to uncertainty.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only the 3rd best stock, with a preference for AI stocks, also suggests that the potential for significant price appreciation from this news alone is limited.

Considering the balanced outlook and the consensus from previous models, which show a slight tendency towards a price rise, but with a significant number of models predicting a probability of rise below 0.7, a conservative estimate is warranted. The persistent concern about China's market and the potential for a market correction outweigh the bullish sentiment presented in the headline.  Therefore, I'm adjusting the probability slightly downward from the initial consensus, reflecting the persistent uncertainty and the potential for a market correction."

While the expected EPS and revenue are higher than the previous year, the emphasis on iPhone demand suggests that any shortfall in iPhone sales could negatively impact the stock price. The market's reaction will likely depend on whether Apple meets, exceeds, or falls short of iPhone sales expectations. Given the uncertainty and the focus on a single product line, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise. If iPhone sales are strong, the stock will likely rise. If they are weak, the stock will likely fall. The market has already priced in some growth, so simply meeting expectations might not be enough to cause a significant rise."

If Apple meets or slightly exceeds expectations, the stock price might see a modest rise, but if iPhone sales disappoint, even if overall earnings are positive, the stock price could fall. The uncertainty surrounding iPhone demand creates a significant risk factor.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively neutral outcome, with a slightly higher chance of a price rise given the expected earnings growth, but a significant possibility of a price fall if iPhone sales are weaker than anticipated."

This suggests positive financial performance. However, the headline emphasizes investor concern about iPhone demand, which is a critical driver of Apple's revenue. While the earnings growth is a positive signal, the uncertainty around iPhone demand could temper investor optimism.

The iterative predictions from various models show a convergence towards a higher probability of a price rise (around 0.61-0.63), primarily due to the expected earnings beat. However, the risk of iPhone sales disappointing remains substantial.  A significant positive surprise regarding iPhone sales would be needed for a substantial price rise; conversely, even a slight miss could trigger a price drop despite overall earnings growth.  Considering the overall sentiment and the potential for both positive and negative surprises, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a relatively balanced outlook, slightly favoring a price rise due to the expected earnings growth but acknowledging the significant risk of a fall if iPhone sales disappoint. The slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise across the prediction rounds suggests a growing confidence in the positive earnings outlook, but the persistent concern about iPhone demand keeps the probability of a fall from being negligible.  I'm slightly adjusting the probabilities to reflect the consensus and the inherent risk."

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Australia\u2019s central bank is honing its focus on potential financial shocks linked to the nation\u2019s fast-growing A$4.1 trillion ($2.6 trillion) pensions industry, and working through multiple scenarios with regulators.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials  Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo US Students\u2019 Reading Scores Drop to Worst in More Than 20 Years Texas HOA Charged With Discrimination for Banning Section 8 Renters\n\nSpeaking at a conference run by Conexus Financial on Thursday, Reserve Bank Assistant Governor Brad Jones said it would be a \u201cdereliction of our duty not to be engaging with the industry\u201d on liquidity risks. He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

        "headline": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) Reports 6% Revenue Growth in Q4 2024, Driven by New Product Launches and AI Integration",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The introduction of Apple Intelligence and its positive reception are also favorable. Goldman Sachs remains bullish on AI futures and acknowledges Apple's role as an AI superstar. However, there are concerns about increasing competition from international players like DeepSeek, hedge funds reducing their positions in tech stocks, and regulatory uncertainties surrounding AI projects. The article also suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe. Considering these factors, the positive news is somewhat tempered by the negative aspects, leading to a more balanced outlook. The 6% revenue growth is solid, but the hedge fund activity and competitive pressures introduce uncertainty."

Generally, if the earnings report exceeds market expectations, it can lead to a rise in stock price, while disappointing results can lead to a decline. Given the context of the broader economic indicators, such as the anticipated slowdown in GDP growth and pending home sales data, there may be a cautious sentiment in the market. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance often lead to positive reactions unless the earnings are significantly below expectations. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a notable chance of falling if the earnings report is disappointing."

The market's reaction will depend on whether the earnings meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations. Secondly, the release of Q4 GDP data, expected to show slowing growth, could negatively impact market sentiment and potentially affect Apple's stock. However, the overall impact is difficult to predict without knowing the actual earnings figures. Given the mixed signals (earnings release vs. slowing GDP), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a stock price rise if earnings are positive and a slightly lower probability if earnings are negative. Since the news doesn't give any indication of whether the earnings will be positive or negative, I will assume a neutral stance."

Therefore, the impact of this news on Apple's stock price is uncertain.  The probability of a price rise or fall is largely dependent on the actual earnings report and how the market reacts to it.

Earnings reports are critical events that can significantly impact stock prices based on whether the company meets, exceeds, or falls short of market expectations. Additionally, the release of Q4 GDP data and pending home sales figures could influence broader market sentiment, which may indirectly affect Apple's stock. Given Apple's historical performance and market position, there is a reasonable chance of positive earnings, but uncertainty remains due to macroeconomic factors like slowing GDP growth and interest rate dynamics. The probabilities are balanced but slightly tilted towards a positive outcome given Apple's strong track record."

The article also mentions that several other companies are releasing their quarterly earnings results, and economic data such as Q4 GDP and new pending home sales will be released. However, there is no specific information in the headline or article that would lead to a strongly positive or negative outlook for Apple. As a result, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. Given that earnings reports can sometimes beat expectations and sometimes disappoint, and considering the general market events, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising at 0.55 and falling at 0.45."

Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight tilt towards a positive outcome, likely reflecting Apple's generally strong performance history. However, the range of predictions (from 0.4 to 0.65 for a rise) indicates considerable uncertainty. I will adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly more cautious outlook, acknowledging the potential for disappointment and the slowing GDP growth. Also, the previous rounds' predictions are quite varied, suggesting no strong consensus or insider information leaning heavily in one direction. Therefore, I will slightly reduce the probability of a rise compared to the highest prediction in the previous rounds. The trend of the previous predictions is slightly decreasing, so I will also take this into consideration. Given the slight downward trend in previous predictions, I will adjust my prediction slightly downwards from the average of the last round."

This range indicates considerable uncertainty and the absence of a strong consensus or insider information heavily influencing the predictions.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty surrounding earnings reports, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect a balanced outlook, slightly favoring a rise due to Apple's historical strength, but acknowledging the potential for negative surprises given the macroeconomic context and the possibility of the earnings falling short of expectations. The slight downward trend in predictions across rounds suggests a cautious approach is warranted."
