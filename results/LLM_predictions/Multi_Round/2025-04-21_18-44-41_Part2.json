        "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup offering competitive AI models at a lower cost, could potentially pressure Apple to innovate more efficiently and potentially reduce its AI infrastructure spending in the long run. Tim Cook's comment about innovation driving efficiency being a good thing suggests Apple is aware of this trend and potentially open to adapting. However, the news also mentions Apple's revenue being down 11% year-over-year in China, which is a significant concern. While the DeepSeek news itself didn't directly cause a sell-off in Apple stock, the broader implications for the AI landscape and Apple's existing challenges in China create uncertainty. Given the mixed signals, I believe the probability of a stock price rise or fall is relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards a potential fall due to the existing revenue concerns in China."

While Cook mentions that innovation driving efficiency is good, his statement lacks specifics regarding Apple's plans or how DeepSeek directly affects Apple's business.  The news also highlights Apple's existing challenges in China, with an 11% year-over-year revenue decline. This negative factor counteracts any potential positive sentiment from Cook's comments.  The overall impact of DeepSeek on Apple is unclear, and the news doesn't provide a strong catalyst for either a significant price rise or fall. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted towards a neutral stance, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to the existing challenges in China."

Lower interest rate expectations are generally positive for stock prices, as they reduce borrowing costs for companies and make stocks more attractive relative to bonds. Since the overall market is rising, it is likely that Apple (AAPL) will also experience a positive movement.

Trump's criticism suggests potential political tensions, which could add another layer of uncertainty. However, the statement that the fines are 'not a tax' could be interpreted as a signal that the EU is focused on correcting anti-competitive behavior rather than simply extracting revenue. Overall, the news is slightly negative, as it reinforces the ongoing regulatory challenges Apple faces, but the 'not a tax' comment mitigates some of the downside risk. Therefore, the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise."

The overall market sentiment is also positive, with the Nasdaq Composite up over 1.1% and the S&P 500 up around 0.6%. This context supports a higher likelihood of AAPL's stock price rising. Given the consistent positive predictions from various models across multiple rounds, ranging from 0.7 to 0.85 for a stock price rise, it is reasonable to estimate a high probability of the stock price rising.

However, Apple's recent stock performance shows a slight decline of 0.7%, and the overall market sentiment may be cautious due to mixed results from other companies in the AI space.

Therefore, the probabilities reflect a cautious optimism about a potential rise, balanced by the recent decline."

The article mentions Apple finished trading down 0.7% despite announcing a cash dividend and increased earnings/revenue the previous day. This suggests existing positive news is already priced in, and the broader market sentiment or sector-specific concerns (unrelated to the AI healthcare news) are currently weighing on the stock. The article also highlights the performance of other tech companies, with some rising and some falling, indicating a volatile market. Given Apple's recent earnings announcement and dividend, the downside might be limited, but the lack of direct positive news in the article and the previous day's decline suggest a slightly higher probability of a further price decrease in the short term."

While Apple is mentioned, the news is not directly related to Apple's business or recent announcements.  Apple's stock price already fell 0.7% the day before this article, likely due to the previously announced dividend and earnings report. The article highlights other companies' successes and failures in the AI cloud space, but provides no specific information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The positive sentiment surrounding AI, coupled with Apple's strong revenue growth and its ranking among important AI stocks, suggests a favorable outlook for AAPL. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI features in the latest product lineup may temper enthusiasm.

On one hand, Apple is actively integrating AI into its devices, particularly with the launch of Apple Intelligence, which is a positive signal. The broader context of the article highlights the significant investment and growth potential in the AI sector, suggesting a favorable environment for companies involved in AI. Apple's strong financial performance in the September 2024 quarter also supports a positive outlook. However, the article also mentions that the iPhone 16 series, despite AI features, did not experience a significant sales boost, raising concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI for Apple. Additionally, the article suggests that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe, potentially diverting investor attention from Apple. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but the lack of immediate sales impact from AI and the potential for better AI investments elsewhere temper the positive outlook. Given these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

                    "reasoning": "The news article highlights the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI and its impact on the tech sector, with Apple (AAPL) positioned as a player in this space.  However, the article also notes that Apple's recent integration of AI into its products (Apple Intelligence) hasn't yet resulted in a significant sales boost for the iPhone 16, suggesting that the immediate financial impact of this AI initiative might be limited.  While the broader AI market is experiencing significant growth and investment, Apple's specific AI strategy and its short-term impact on revenue are less certain. The article explicitly states that the author believes other AI stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. This suggests a relatively neutral to slightly negative outlook on AAPL's stock price movement specifically in relation to this news.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of a price remaining relatively unchanged or even slightly falling, given the context of the article."

Additionally, AI's influence on various sectors, including technology, is expected to drive a surge in investments and electricity demand. While some investors worry about an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash, current data suggests that AI valuations are more grounded than those in the past. With AI expected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade and boost US productivity by 9%, Apple's incorporation of AI into its devices and services could lead to increased demand and potentially drive its stock price up."

Meanwhile services revenue was up 14%, with revenue from China down 11%.\n\n\"Overall another very strong quarter,\" said Neil Wilson, analyst at Tipranks. \"It was the first quarterly numbers since the rollout of Apple Intelligence, the company\u2019s suite of AI features. Apple (AAPL) expects growth in the March quarter of \u201clow to mid-single digits\u201d and \u201clow double digits\u201d growth for its Services division\".\n\nFor the year-to-date Apple (AAPL) stock is 2.6% lower, knocked amid a wider tech rout related to worries around Chinese AI challenger DeepSeek.\n\n\u201cThe roll-out of AI services on iPhone 16 hasn\u2019t exactly gone smoothly. Having been late to the AI party in the first place, Apple (AAPL) still hasn\u2019t rolled out AI services in any non-English language,\" said Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell.\n\n\"This cautious pace seems odd when you consider AI has exploded onto the scene and consumers increasingly have a lot of choice for AI-enabled devices. It\u2019s like a carrot dangled in front of Apple (AAPL) and it only wants to nibble at it, rather than devour the whole thing.\"\n\n\u201cConsumers need a reason to upgrade their phone, otherwise they\u2019re going to stick with their current model given how even the cheapest devices are fairly sophisticated these days. Apple (AAPL) is clearly hoping its AI services will be the catalyst to drive handset upgrades, but it\u2019s going about it in a strange way.\"\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(AAPL)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nIntel (INTC)\n\nIntel (INTC) stock gained 1.3% on Thursday and was trading 1.7% higher in premarket on Friday following a quarterly earnings report which beat fourth quarter expectations, but gave a tepid read for the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe CPU and chipmaker posted adjusted earnings per share of $0.13, above the analyst estimate of $0.12.\n\nRevenue for the quarter came in at $14.3bn, beating consensus estimates of $13.8bn but declining 7% year-on-year. For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates. The increase comes off the back of sales of its heart failure drug, Entresto, and multiple sclerosis drug Kesimpta.\n\nStory Continues\n\nEntrestro, which will lose its patent protection later this year, saw quarterly revenues jump by a third to $2.2bn.\n\nFor Q4, net income rose 26% to $3.9bn. This surpassed analyst consensus of $3.6bn, Reuters reported.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(NVS)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nShell (SHEL.L)\n\nOil major Shell (SHEL.L) was trading 0.8% higher in the morning on Friday, building on gains from the week following its quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe company reported a sharp fall in profits in the fourth quarter but declared another $3.5bn (\u00a32.8bn) share buyback.\n\nAdjusted earnings of $3.66bn in the fourth quarter were down 39% on the $6bn Shell (SHEL.L) posted in the third quarter, according to its latest results. For the year, adjusted earnings were down 16% to $23.7bn, compared to $28.3bn in 2023.\n\nShell said income attributable to shareholders had fallen 78% to $928m in the fourth quarter, down from $4.2bn in previous quarter.\n\nHowever, this figure was higher than the $474m it reported in the same period last year.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SHEL.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L)\n\nSmiths Group (SMIN.L) was the top riser in the FTSE 100 (^FTSE) on Friday, up more than 14% after the opening bell following news it had responded to activist investor calls to split up its business. The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure. Next steps will be closely watched, with Engine also floating the possibility of a US listing for its John Crane energy services arm which Engine describes as its jewel in the crown.\u201d\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(SMIN.L)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nView Comments",

Analyst opinions are mixed, highlighting both the positive earnings and the risks associated with Apple's AI strategy and its exposure to the Chinese market.  Previous predictions show a consensus leaning towards a price rise, but with probabilities generally ranging from 0.6 to 0.78.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, I'm weighting the positive earnings beat and pre-market reaction more heavily than the AI and China concerns, but acknowledging the risks. The consistent upward trend in predictions across multiple rounds also suggests a higher likelihood of a price rise.  However, the substantial concerns about AI implementation and the Chinese market prevent a significantly higher probability."

        "headline": "Can This Popular Vanguard Tech ETF Trounce the S&amp;P 500 Again in 2025?",
        "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While the article acknowledges the long-term potential of AI and the tech sector, it raises concerns about Apple's strategic direction (following AI trends rather than leading) and its potential impact on the ETF's performance. The article also highlights valuation concerns for Nvidia and Microsoft, two other significant holdings. The 'Double Down' advertisement at the end is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple. Overall, the article presents a mixed outlook for Apple, leaning slightly negative due to the strategic shift and potential erosion of its premium market positioning.

Specifically, it mentions the high valuations of MSFT and NVDA, and questions Apple's strategic shift in AI, suggesting it might be following trends rather than setting them. The emergence of cost-effective AI models from Chinese companies also introduces competitive risks.  The overall tone is cautious, suggesting that while long-term prospects remain positive, the ETF (and therefore its major holdings like AAPL) might not significantly outperform the market in 2025.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than a price fall, but not drastically so, as the long-term outlook remains positive and the article doesn't predict a significant downturn."

These factors introduce meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook, which could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, the long-term growth potential of AI and Apple's exposure to this transformative technology could provide some support. Considering the mixed signals and cautious tone of the article, as well as the consensus from previous predictions, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling."

The article's cautious tone and the consensus of previous predictions reinforce this assessment. While the long-term potential of AI is acknowledged, the near-term risks and strategic challenges for Apple outweigh the positive aspects. The 'Double Down' advertisement is a generic marketing tactic and doesn't provide specific insight into Apple's prospects. Given the consistent trend, I am slightly increasing the probability of a fall."

While acknowledging the long-term potential of AI and the tech sector, the article expresses significant near-term concerns. These concerns center on Apple's strategic shift in AI (following trends instead of setting them), potentially eroding its premium positioning.  Further, the high valuations of other major VGT holdings (Nvidia and Microsoft) suggest much of their anticipated growth is already priced in. The emergence of cost-effective AI models from China introduces additional competitive risks.  While the long-term outlook for AI remains positive, the article's overall tone is cautious, suggesting a higher probability of AAPL underperforming in the near term.  The consensus of previous models also leans towards a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's fundamental strength and long-term prospects in AI mitigate the negative impact, preventing an extremely high probability of a fall.  Considering the mixed signals and the weight of the negative factors presented, and the consistent negative trend in previous predictions, a higher probability of a price fall is assigned.  The consistent downward trend in predictions across multiple rounds further strengthens the case for a higher probability of a price fall."

While the ETF has historically outperformed the S&P 500, concerns are raised about the near-term performance due to high valuations of major holdings like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft. Specifically, Apple's strategic pivot towards AI through partnerships rather than leading innovation is seen as a potential risk to its premium market positioning. The emergence of cost-effective AI models from Chinese companies adds competitive pressure. However, the long-term growth potential of AI and Apple's exposure to this transformative technology provide some support.
