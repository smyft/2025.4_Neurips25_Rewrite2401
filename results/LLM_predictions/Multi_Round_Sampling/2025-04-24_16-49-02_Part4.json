                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure.

The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The lack of specific news makes it difficult to assign a significantly higher probability to either a rise or fall.  Considering the overall distribution of previous predictions and the inherent uncertainty of long-term stock predictions based on this headline alone, a probability close to 0.5 for both rise and fall is most appropriate.

To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The lack of specific news makes it difficult to assign a significantly higher probability to either a rise or fall.  Considering the overall distribution of previous predictions and the inherent uncertainty of long-term stock predictions based on this headline alone, a probability close to 0.5 for both rise and fall is most appropriate.  The slight upward bias in some predictions likely reflects general optimism surrounding Apple's long-term prospects, but this is not directly supported by the provided headline.

In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "reasoning": "The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it acknowledges Apple's past success and the shift towards services, it also raises concerns about future growth due to the maturity of the iPhone market, a high P/E ratio, and the Motley Fool's recommendation against investing. The analyst consensus suggests modest growth. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mix of opinions, but a slight tendency towards a positive outlook. However, the current article's cautious tone and the specific mention of limited upside potential suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling. I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect this more cautious outlook, while still acknowledging Apple's inherent strengths. The fact that the Motley Fool's analysts identified other stocks as better investments than Apple is a significant negative signal. The high P/E ratio and the maturity of the iPhone market are also concerning. While Apple's shift to services is a positive development, it may not be enough to offset these negative factors."

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline is highly speculative and provides no concrete information to directly influence Apple's stock price.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting long-term stock movements five years out.  While some models highlight positive aspects like Apple's AI investments and strong brand, others express concerns about market maturity and valuation.  The lack of specific news makes it difficult to assign a significantly higher probability to either a rise or fall.  Considering the overall distribution of previous predictions and the inherent uncertainty of long-term stock predictions based on this headline alone, a probability close to 0.5 for both rise and fall is most appropriate. The slight upward bias in some predictions likely reflects general optimism surrounding Apple's long-term prospects, but this is not directly supported by the provided headline.  The lack of new information means the headline itself is unlikely to be a major driver of price movement; other market factors will be far more influential.  The trend in predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of a rise over the rounds, but this is likely due to the models incorporating previous predictions rather than new information from the headline itself.  Therefore, a neutral prediction is most justified."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d.

In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately.

On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications.

However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities.

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

While it acknowledges Apple's past success and the shift towards services, it also raises concerns about future growth due to the maturity of the iPhone market, a high P/E ratio, and the Motley Fool's recommendation against investing. The analyst consensus suggests modest growth. Considering the previous rounds, there's a mix of opinions, but a slight tendency towards a positive outlook. However, the current article's cautious tone and the specific mention of limited upside potential suggest a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling. I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect this more cautious outlook, while still acknowledging Apple's inherent strengths. The fact that the Motley Fool's analysts identified other stocks as better investments than Apple is a significant negative signal. The high P/E ratio and the maturity of the iPhone market are also concerning. While Apple's shift to services is a positive development, it may not be enough to offset these negative factors. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight decrease in the probability of a rise over the rounds, indicating a growing consensus of caution."

The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting long-term stock movements five years out.  While some models highlight positive aspects like Apple's AI investments and strong brand, others express concerns about market maturity and valuation.  The lack of specific news makes it difficult to assign a significantly higher probability to either a rise or fall.  Considering the overall distribution of previous predictions and the inherent uncertainty of long-term stock predictions based on this headline alone, a probability close to 0.5 for both rise and fall is most appropriate. The slight upward bias in some predictions likely reflects general optimism surrounding Apple's long-term prospects, but this is not directly supported by the provided headline.  The lack of new information means the headline itself is unlikely to be a major driver of price movement; other market factors will be far more influential.  The trend in predictions shows some slight shifts, but these are largely due to models incorporating previous predictions rather than new information from the headline.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas.

It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "reasoning": "The provided news article discusses Apple's position in the AI market, highlighting its innovations such as Apple Intelligence and its ranking as the 2nd must-watch AI stock on investors' radar. However, it also mentions challenges, such as issues with Apple Intelligence spreading misinformation and its subsequent suspension. Despite these challenges, the overall tone of the article is neutral to slightly positive, emphasizing Apple's strengths in AI and its potential for future growth. Previous predictions from various models show a range of sentiments, but generally, there is a slight bias towards a positive outlook due to Apple's strong market position, AI investments, and financial performance. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

This endorsement can lead to increased investor confidence and potentially attract more investors to the stock, driving up the price. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock, with most models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. The lack of concrete information about Apple's financials, products, or operations in the news suggests a moderate and short-term impact on the stock price. Given the positive nature of the endorsement and the overall trend in previous predictions, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products.

It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. While it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts (Apple Intelligence, iPhone 116 improvements, significant AI investment), and positive mentions from BlackRock (placing it 6th on their list of important AI stocks),  the article also tempers expectations.  BlackRock's overall commentary suggests investor caution regarding AI spending by tech firms and a diversification away from solely tech investments. JPMorgan's analysis emphasizes the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple, suggesting potential for a 'catch down' scenario if the broader market doesn't see sufficient returns from AI investments. The article itself explicitly states that BlackRock believes other AI stocks hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  Therefore, while the positive aspects of Apple's AI initiatives are noted, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns outweigh the immediate bullish impact of this specific news piece.  The probability of a price rise is thus considered moderate, while the probability of a fall or stagnation is slightly higher."

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The shift towards services is positive, but the article suggests that significant returns are unlikely in the next five years unless the valuation drops. The Motley Fool's recommendation against investing in Apple right now further reinforces a cautious outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more bearish outlook. Therefore, I'm adjusting my probabilities to reflect this increased uncertainty and the potential for a price correction.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

JPMorgan highlights high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks, suggesting a potential 'catch down' if broader AI revenue expectations aren't met.  The article itself suggests other AI stocks might offer better short-term returns.  Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to valuation concerns.  While Apple's AI initiatives are promising, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns outweigh the immediate bullish impact.

In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

While the article highlights Apple's efforts in AI, it also mentions a controversial AI feature that has been spreading misinformation, which the company is working to resolve. Additionally, the article compares Apple to other AI stocks, suggesting that some may hold greater promise for delivering higher returns. Considering these factors, the overall impact of the news on Apple's stock price seems neutral to slightly positive, as the company's AI innovations and strong market position are somewhat offset by the controversy surrounding the AI feature. The previous predictions from other models show a mixed outlook, with some predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. However, the majority of the models seem to agree that the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall. Given the information provided and the analysis of the news, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be 0.53 and the probability of the stock price falling to be 0.47."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products.

It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

                                    "reasoning": "The news is positive but contains conflicting signals.  Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts, and inclusion in BlackRock's top AI stocks list are bullish. However, the overall market sentiment is cautious. BlackRock's commentary suggests investor caution regarding AI spending and diversification away from tech. JPMorgan highlights high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks, suggesting a potential 'catch down' if broader AI revenue expectations aren't met. The article itself suggests other AI stocks might offer better short-term returns. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to valuation concerns. While Apple's AI initiatives are promising, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns outweigh the immediate bullish impact.  Considering the balanced nature of the news and the previous predictions, a slightly bearish outlook is warranted, with a higher probability assigned to a price stagnation or slight decline than a significant rise.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns, while acknowledging the positive aspects of Apple's AI initiatives.  The consistent leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall in the previous rounds, despite some positive news, reinforces the cautious outlook."

The consensus leans slightly towards a cautious outlook due to overvaluation and limited growth prospects, but the Buffett endorsement provides a counterbalance. Considering these factors, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not significantly so."

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

The Motley Fool's recommendation against investing in Apple right now further reinforces a cautious outlook. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more bearish outlook. Therefore, I'm adjusting my probabilities to reflect this increased uncertainty and the potential for a price correction.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts, and inclusion in BlackRock's top AI stocks list are bullish. However, the overall market sentiment is cautious. BlackRock's commentary suggests investor caution regarding AI spending and diversification away from tech. JPMorgan highlights high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks, suggesting a potential 'catch down' if broader AI revenue expectations aren't met. The article itself suggests other AI stocks might offer better short-term returns.  Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to valuation concerns. While Apple's AI initiatives are promising, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns outweigh the immediate bullish impact. Considering the balanced nature of the news and the previous predictions, a slightly bearish outlook is warranted, with a higher probability assigned to a price stagnation or slight decline than a significant rise. The consistent leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall in the previous rounds, despite some positive news, reinforces the cautious outlook.  The high P/E ratio of 38.4 also contributes to the bearish sentiment."

The expected growth in EPS is moderate at 11.4% annually, leading to a projected stock price increase of only 34% over the next five years. While some models highlight Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts, and positive mentions from BlackRock, others point to high valuation and market maturity concerns.

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "headline": "My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One",
                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "reasoning": "The article presents a balanced view of Apple's future. While it acknowledges Apple's past success and the shift towards a higher-margin services business, it also highlights concerns about slowing growth, a high P/E ratio, and the maturity of the iPhone market. The article also mentions analyst expectations of moderate EPS growth and a potential P/E contraction, leading to a projected modest stock price increase over the next five years. The Motley Fool's advertisement at the end, suggesting other stocks might be better investments, further reinforces a cautious outlook. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight downward trend in the perceived probability of the stock rising. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term, as the market may react negatively to the concerns raised about valuation and growth."

While Apple is a consumer durables company, this headline alone doesn't offer any directional bias for its stock price.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from a 40% to 70% probability of a price rise.  Some models cite positive factors like Apple's strong market position and positive analyst ratings, while others highlight concerns about valuation and growth.  The lack of specific news related to Apple makes it difficult to assign a significantly higher probability to either a rise or fall. Considering the overall uncertainty and the range of previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The slight skew towards a higher probability of a rise in some previous predictions likely reflects Apple's generally strong performance and market position, rather than any direct impact from this vague news headline."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "headline": "My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One",
                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

While it acknowledges Apple's past success and the shift towards a higher-margin services business, it also highlights concerns about slowing growth, a high P/E ratio, and the maturity of the iPhone market. The article also mentions analyst expectations of moderate EPS growth and a potential P/E contraction, leading to a projected modest stock price increase over the next five years. The Motley Fool's advertisement at the end, suggesting other stocks might be better investments, further reinforces a cautious outlook. The previous rounds of predictions show a slight downward trend in the perceived probability of the stock rising. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term, as the market may react negatively to the concerns raised about valuation and growth. The article's conclusion that strong returns are unlikely unless the valuation drops substantially is a key factor in this assessment. The fact that the Motley Fool suggests other stocks are better investments is also a negative signal."

While some models lean towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Apple's strong market position and positive analyst ratings (and some specific positive news mentioned in some rounds), others highlight concerns about valuation and growth.  The lack of specific news related to Apple makes it difficult to assign a significantly higher probability to either a rise or fall.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the range of previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate.  The slight upward trend in the probability of a rise across rounds likely reflects the models' gradual incorporation of additional, unspecified information or a general positive bias towards Apple's long-term prospects, rather than any direct impact from the vague news headline itself.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Motley Fool's advertisement at the end, suggesting other stocks might be better investments, reinforces a cautious outlook. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight downward trend in the perceived probability of the stock rising. The article's conclusion that strong returns are unlikely unless the valuation drops substantially is a key factor. The fact that the Motley Fool suggests other stocks are better investments is also a negative signal. Given these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise in the short term, as the market may react negatively to the concerns raised about valuation and growth.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Cliff Asness' bullish stance on Apple Inc. (AAPL) as part of his top stock picks. AQR Capital Management holds a $1.87 billion stake in AAPL. Despite Asness' concerns about the U.S. stock market and high CAPE ratios, his firm maintains a significant position in AAPL. Additionally, Evercore ISI recently reaffirmed its Outperform rating on AAPL with a price target of $250. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue increased by 6% year-over-year, and the company's services revenue, particularly the App Store, showed strong performance. These factors contribute to a positive outlook for AAPL. However, the overall concerns about the U.S. stock market and high CAPE ratios may temper the stock's growth. Considering these factors and the range of previous predictions that generally leaned towards a positive outlook for Apple, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

                                    "headline": "My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One",
                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The Motley Fool's advertisement at the end, suggesting other stocks might be better investments, reinforces a cautious outlook. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight downward trend in the perceived probability of the stock rising.

The fact that the Motley Fool suggests other stocks are better investments is also a negative signal.

However, the lack of concrete news means the probabilities are not strongly skewed in either direction.

                                    "headline": "Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(AAPL) as part of his top stock picks, with AQR Capital Management holding a $1.87 billion stake in AAPL. Despite Asness' concerns about the U.S. stock market and high CAPE ratios, his firm maintains a significant position in AAPL. Additionally, Evercore ISI recently reaffirmed its Outperform rating on AAPL with a price target of $250. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue increased by 6% year-over-year, and the company's services revenue, particularly the App Store, showed strong performance. These factors contribute to a positive outlook for AAPL. However, the overall concerns about the U.S. stock market and high CAPE ratios may temper the stock's growth. Considering these factors and the range of previous predictions that generally leaned towards a positive outlook for Apple, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion.

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The article points out that Apple's P/E ratio is high, suggesting the stock might be overvalued.  The projected EPS growth of 11.4% annually over the next three years, even if sustained, combined with a potential P/E ratio contraction to 30, only leads to a projected 34% stock price increase in five years. This is considered modest given the current valuation. The maturity of the iPhone market and potential for slower upgrade cycles also contribute to a cautious outlook.  The article's conclusion leans towards a less optimistic view, suggesting that significant returns are unlikely unless the valuation drops substantially.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is assigned a lower value than the probability of a price fall or stagnation, reflecting the cautious tone and valuation concerns expressed."

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "headline": "My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One",
                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

The maturity of the iPhone market is another factor contributing to a cautious outlook.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a higher probability of a price fall.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of any significantly new information, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement. The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but the uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for both rise and fall."

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

While it highlights the company's strong brand, substantial revenue, and successful transition towards services, it also raises concerns about valuation and future growth. The article notes that Apple's P/E ratio is high, suggesting the stock might be overvalued, and projects a modest 34% stock price increase over the next five years. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions from bullish to cautious, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling or remaining stable."

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Previous predictions are varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of any significantly new information, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement. The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but the uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for both rise and fall.

                                    "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

Previous predictions are varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of any significantly new information, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement. The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but the uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for both rise and fall. The fact that the article itself concludes that significant returns are unlikely unless the valuation drops substantially weighs heavily on the prediction.  The previous rounds show a convergence towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but the inherent uncertainty remains.  I'm weighting the previous predictions heavily, as they represent a diverse set of models and perspectives.

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Previous predictions from other models also lean towards a positive outlook, with most assigning higher probabilities to a stock price rise. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is assessed to be higher than that of it falling."

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when\u00a0Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you\u2019d have $818,587!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio.

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights positive aspects like strong brand, successful services segment, and cash flow generation, it also raises significant concerns about valuation and future growth. The high P/E ratio suggests potential overvaluation, and projected EPS growth, while positive, may not justify the current price. The maturity of the iPhone market adds to the cautious outlook.  Previous predictions from various models are varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of any significantly new information, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement. The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but the uncertainty warrants a relatively low probability for both rise and fall. The fact that the article itself concludes that significant returns are unlikely unless the valuation drops substantially weighs heavily on the prediction. The previous rounds show some convergence towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but the inherent uncertainty remains significant.  I'm weighting the previous predictions heavily, as they represent a diverse set of models and perspectives.  The slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise across rounds suggests a cautiously optimistic outlook, but the inherent uncertainty remains significant.  Therefore, I'm slightly adjusting the probabilities to reflect a more balanced view, acknowledging the potential for both upward and downward movement, but still leaning slightly towards a rise due to the positive long-term perspective presented in the article and the overall positive sentiment from previous predictions."

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products.

One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple.

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Considering the previous predictions, which show a consensus leaning towards a price rise (ranging from 0.6 to 0.85 probability of a rise), and the inherent uncertainty in the stock market, I've adjusted the probability slightly downward to account for market volatility and the fact that the news is not a major unexpected event.

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article is positive but lacks significant new information.  Warren Buffett's long-term holding in Apple is already widely known and factored into the stock price. The article reiterates Apple's strengths: strong fundamentals, growing services revenue, high profit margins, and a large customer base.  However, the article also acknowledges the stock's high valuation.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.85 across multiple models and rounds.  Considering the lack of truly novel information and the inherent volatility of the stock market, I'm adjusting the probability of a rise slightly downward from the highest previous predictions to account for potential market corrections or unforeseen events.  The overall sentiment remains positive, but the impact is likely to be gradual rather than a dramatic, immediate surge."

                                    "headline": "My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One",
                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The article reiterates Apple's strengths: strong fundamentals, growing services revenue, high profit margins, and a large customer base. However, the article also acknowledges the stock's high valuation.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.85 across multiple models and rounds.

The consensus from multiple AI models across rounds suggests a moderate increase in probability is warranted, but not a drastic shift.  The fact that the article features Apple alongside Amazon also dilutes the impact of the positive news specifically on Apple."

                                    "headline": "My 5 Largest Portfolio Holdings Heading Into 2025 -- and the Important Investing Lesson I Learned From Each One",
                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

BlackRock's overall commentary suggests investor caution regarding AI spending by tech firms and a diversification away from solely tech investments. JPMorgan's analysis emphasizes the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple, suggesting potential for a 'catch down' scenario if the broader market doesn't see sufficient returns from AI investments.

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nWith everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Additionally, while there is strong hedge fund interest in AAPL, the overall market sentiment regarding AI stocks is cautious, with some analysts suggesting that other AI stocks may offer better returns. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of it falling due to the recent negative press and broader market concerns."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks.

However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

However, the article also includes cautionary notes from BlackRock and JPMorgan regarding overall AI investment and the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks.  JPMorgan's analysis suggests a potential 'catch down' scenario if broader market AI adoption doesn't meet expectations.  While Apple's AI initiatives are promising, the tempered expectations and valuation concerns from prominent investment firms, coupled with the lack of specific short-term catalysts, outweigh the purely positive aspects of the news.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty inherent in the market. Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for a price fall due to broader market concerns and valuation pressures.  The overall sentiment leans slightly positive due to Apple's strong fundamentals and AI advancements, but the risk of a correction due to high valuation remains."

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with a significant chance of it falling due to the recent negative press and broader market concerns."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

However, several counterpoints temper the bullish sentiment. BlackRock and JPMorgan express caution regarding overall AI investment and the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks. JPMorgan suggests a potential 'catch down' if broader market AI adoption disappoints. While Apple's AI initiatives are promising, these valuation concerns and broader market uncertainties outweigh the purely positive aspects.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting the inherent market uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of immediate catalysts, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for a price fall due to broader market concerns and valuation pressures. The convergence of predictions towards a slightly positive outlook in later rounds is noted, but the uncertainty remains significant."

The absence of negative news in the headline and the positive association with Buffett's investment strategy tilt the probabilities slightly towards a rise. However, the lack of specific short-term catalysts or financial data tempers the optimism.

                                    "content": "In the past five years, the S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) has generated a total return of 92% (as of Jan. 14). That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

That's a fantastic gain that's above the historical average.\n\nA strong market backdrop has lifted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) even further. The tech giant's shares would have more than tripled your money since the middle of January 2020, including dividends.\n\nThe business continues to be a dominant force across the globe. But where will this consumer discretionary stock be five years from now?\n\nHardware is important\n\nApple is known for selling popular hardware devices. The iPhone, which today represents about half of overall sales, even though it's a product in its 16th iteration, still essentially drives financial performance. However, the company has also developed and found smashing success with the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nFive years ago in fiscal 2019, 82% of Apple's total revenue came strictly from products. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as consumers all over the world have grown an affinity to these devices. That's precisely what has made Apple the most valuable brand, according to consultancy Interbrand.\n\nAnd it has supported pricing power. It's crazy to think that people will pay a four-figure sum for a smartphone. Apple has single-handedly redefined the category, and it continues to reap the rewards in the form of massive profits.\n\nA shifting business model\n\nBut Apple's business model is transitioning. In fiscal 2024, 75% of total revenue came from products, with the rest coming from services. The latter segment's dollar amount, however, of $96 billion is 108% higher than five years before, a much faster growth rate than products registered. This segment contains a wide range of money-making activities, including iCloud, advertising, AppleCare, App Store, Apple TV+, Apple Fitness+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, Apple Pay, and Apple Card.\n\nIt's encouraging to see the company evolve like this. After all, Apple's services, in combination with products, are what make up the powerful ecosystem. It builds customer loyalty and creates a bigger recurring revenue stream over time.\n\nInvestors were worried that Apple would fall behind the artificial intelligence (AI) race. But the business finally launched Apple Intelligence, a suite of AI-related features, late last year. At the end of the day, though, it still matters greatly that this initiative can drive more product sales. This ultimately leads to those devices subscribing to an Apple service.\n\nI believe it's reasonable to assume that services and software will become even more important to Apple's financial success over time, meaning the trend will continue. This is a good thing, as the division carries a gross margin in excess of 70%.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple's return potential\n\nApple shares have jumped nearly 200% in the past five years. This was supported by significantly higher earnings per share (EPS) between fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2024.\n\nHowever, investors must be aware that the valuation has also gotten richer. Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at this writing is 38.4. Five years ago, in mid-January 2020, the P/E multiple was at 25. The 54% expansion indicates improving market sentiment toward the business. The current P/E ratio has actually rarely been more expensive in the past decade.\n\nApple has a powerful brand thanks to its incredibly popular products and services. And its ability to produce free cash flow is admirable.\n\nBut with fiscal 2024 sales of $391 billion, it's difficult to believe outsized growth is on the horizon, especially since the iPhone is becoming more mature and consumers might not feel the need to upgrade to newer models as often.\n\nWall Street consensus analyst estimates see EPS rising at an annualized clip of 11.4% over the next three years. Assuming that gain continues in the years after that forecast period, coupled with the possibility of the P/E ratio contracting to 30 (still a premium to the market), the stock price is expected to increase just 34% between now and the start of 2030.\n\nTherefore, unless the valuation drops substantially, it's unlikely Apple will generate strong returns over the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now\u2026 and Apple wasn\u2019t one of them.

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article highlights Warren Buffett's long-term investment strategy and his confidence in Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a quality company with a growing and loyal customer base. The article also mentions Apple's increasing active installed base of devices, expansion of its services business, and high profit margins. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway's significant holding in Apple and Warren Buffett's statement that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year suggest a positive outlook for the company. However, concerns about high valuations and potential market volatility are also noted. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a trend of cautious optimism about the stock price rising, balanced by the potential for a decline due to valuation concerns and market sentiment. Based on this analysis, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling."

The various models provided have different perspectives ranging from cautiously optimistic to more skeptical views. There's a mix of positive sentiment from Warren Buffett's backing and Apple's strong fundamentals, alongside concerns about high valuations and slower returns.

                                    "headline": "Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm.

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "headline": "Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Asness is a respected figure in finance, and his endorsement could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL shares. Additionally, the reaffirmation of an 'Outperform' rating by Evercore ISI, along with strong revenue growth in the latest quarter, supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsements and strong financial performance suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to a fall."

While the article acknowledges the stock's high valuation, it suggests dollar-cost averaging as a risk mitigation strategy.  The overall tone is bullish, suggesting a strong long-term outlook. However, the article is from Motley Fool, which has a known bullish bias, and the inclusion of a 'Double Down' advertisement raises concerns about potential marketing influence.  Furthermore, the information is dated January 13, 2025, meaning it's not entirely current. Considering these factors, and the previous predictions which range from 0.6 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise than some previous models, accounting for the potential biases and time sensitivity of the news."

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year.

Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential.

Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "headline": "Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Asness is a respected figure in finance, and his endorsement could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL shares. Additionally, the reaffirmation of an 'Outperform' rating by Evercore ISI, along with strong revenue growth in the latest quarter, supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsements and strong financial performance suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to a fall."

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company.

From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year.

Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Asness is a respected figure in finance, and his endorsement could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL shares. Additionally, the reaffirmation of an 'Outperform' rating by Evercore ISI, along with strong revenue growth in the latest quarter, supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm. Considering the previous predictions, which consistently show a bullish outlook, and the positive nature of the news, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising compared to falling."

                                    "headline": "Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Asness is a respected figure in finance, and his endorsement could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL shares. Additionally, the reaffirmation of an 'Outperform' rating by Evercore ISI, along with strong revenue growth in the latest quarter, supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsements and strong financial performance suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to a fall."

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The previous predictions consistently show a high probability of a price rise, ranging from 0.6 to 0.8.

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm.

Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Asness is a respected figure in finance, and his endorsement could lead to increased investor confidence and demand for AAPL shares. Additionally, the reaffirmation of an 'Outperform' rating by Evercore ISI, along with strong revenue growth in the latest quarter, supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm. Overall, the positive endorsements and strong financial performance suggest a higher probability of stock price rise compared to a fall."

It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, there are concerns about the overall U.S. stock market performance and potential volatility, which could temper enthusiasm. The previous predictions also show a general bullish sentiment with probabilities ranging from 0.65 to 0.8, indicating a positive trend.

The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It emphasizes Apple's strong brand loyalty, growing customer base, and successful services business. The article also mentions Apple's revenue growth and potential catalysts like Apple Intelligence. While the article acknowledges that the stock has become expensive, it suggests a dollar-cost averaging approach. Overall, the news is positive for Apple, suggesting long-term growth potential and stability. However, the article is from Motley Fool, which is known for its bullish stance on many stocks. Also, the article is dated January 13, 2025, which is in the future. I will assume the date is a typo and the article is recent. Given the positive sentiment and Buffett's endorsement, a rise in stock price is more likely than a fall, but the 'expensive' comment and general market conditions temper the probability of a significant rise."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

While it highlights Apple's strong financials, AI integration efforts (Apple Intelligence, iPhone 116 improvements, significant AI investment), and positive mentions from BlackRock (placing it 6th on their list of important AI stocks),  the article also tempers expectations.  BlackRock's overall commentary suggests investor caution regarding AI spending by tech firms and a diversification away from solely tech investments. JPMorgan's analysis emphasizes the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks like Apple, suggesting potential for a 'catch down' scenario if the broader market doesn't see sufficient returns from AI investments. The article itself explicitly states that BlackRock believes other AI stocks hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe.  Therefore, while the positive aspects of Apple's AI initiatives are noted, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns create uncertainty.  The probability of a price rise is weighted lower due to these counterbalancing factors."

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Asness' endorsement and the company's growing revenue and services sector are positive indicators. However, the article also mentions that Asness predicts mediocre returns for the U.S. stock market in the next ten years, which could impact AAPL's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights the potential of AI stocks, which might affect AAPL's performance. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than falling, but not extremely high due to the cautious market outlook."

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

JPMorgan's analysis emphasizes the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks, suggesting a potential 'catch down' if broader market AI adoption doesn't meet expectations. The article itself acknowledges that BlackRock believes other AI stocks offer greater potential for higher returns in the short term.  Therefore, while Apple's AI initiatives are positive, market sentiment and valuation concerns create uncertainty.

Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as a stock that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has held a large position in since 2016. Buffett has expressed his confidence in Apple, noting it as a better business than any other Berkshire holding. Apple's growing and loyal customer base, increasing active installed base of devices, and expanding services business with high profit margins are seen as positive indicators. The introduction of Apple Intelligence and its potential to drive upgrades also presents a growth opportunity. Despite the stock getting expensive, the long-term growth prospects and current financials, including a $93 billion net profit and $391 billion in revenue, suggest a positive outlook. Therefore, based on the information provided and the overall positive sentiment towards Apple's long-term growth and profitability, there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling."

                                    "headline": "Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Asness' endorsement and the company's growing revenue and services sector are positive indicators. However, the article also mentions that Asness predicts mediocre returns for the U.S. stock market in the next ten years, which could impact AAPL's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights the potential of AI stocks, which might affect AAPL's performance. Considering these factors and the mixed predictions from other models, I have taken a balanced approach to estimate the probabilities. The overall positive sentiment towards Apple's long-term growth and profitability, combined with Asness' endorsement, suggests a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling."

                                    "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc (AAPL): AI Innovations Shaping the Future\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include strong financials, significant AI investments (Apple Intelligence, iPhone 116 improvements), and a prominent position on BlackRock's AI stock list. However, counterbalancing factors include BlackRock's cautious outlook on overall AI spending and a shift towards diversification, and JPMorgan's concerns about high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks.  JPMorgan's analysis suggests a potential 'catch down' scenario if broader market AI adoption doesn't justify current valuations. The article itself highlights that BlackRock believes other AI stocks offer better short-term return potential.  While Apple's AI initiatives are positive, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns create uncertainty. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price rise, but with significant uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals but acknowledging the significant risk of a price fall given the market context."

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Additionally, the article highlights the potential of AI stocks, which might affect AAPL's performance. Considering these factors and the mixed predictions from other models, I have taken a balanced approach to estimate the probabilities.

Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It emphasizes Apple's strong financials, loyal customer base, and growth potential in services and AI. While the stock is considered expensive, the recommendation to dollar-cost average mitigates this concern. Previous predictions also lean towards a positive outlook, with most models assigning a higher probability to a price increase. Considering the positive sentiment and Buffett's endorsement, a rise in stock price is more likely than a fall. The trend of previous predictions also shows an increase in the probability of stock price rising. Therefore, I will adjust the probabilities slightly upwards."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Blackrock's 30 Most Important AI Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. Positive factors include strong financials, significant AI investments (Apple Intelligence, iPhone 116 improvements), and a prominent position on BlackRock's AI stock list.  However, counterbalancing factors include BlackRock's cautious outlook on overall AI spending and a shift towards diversification, and JPMorgan's concerns about high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks. JPMorgan's analysis suggests a potential 'catch down' scenario if broader market AI adoption doesn't justify current valuations. The article itself highlights that BlackRock believes other AI stocks offer better short-term return potential.  While Apple's AI initiatives are positive, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns create uncertainty. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price rise, but with significant uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals but acknowledging the significant risk of a price fall given the market context.  The increasing trend towards a higher probability of a price rise in the previous prediction rounds is also considered, but the inherent uncertainty remains."

The consensus suggests that while there are some concerns about valuation and market conditions, the overall sentiment is favorable due to Apple's strong financials, brand loyalty, and growth initiatives like Apple Intelligence.

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Asness' endorsement and the company's growing revenue and services sector are positive indicators. However, the article also mentions that Asness predicts mediocre returns for the U.S. stock market in the next ten years, which could impact AAPL's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights the potential of AI stocks, which might affect AAPL's performance. Considering these factors and the mixed predictions from other models, I have taken a balanced approach to estimate the probabilities. The overall positive sentiment towards Apple's long-term growth and profitability, combined with Asness' endorsement, suggests a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling."

                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids. This model also offers free ChatGPT access through a partnership with OpenAI, aiming to transform the smartphone experience with AI advancement. Lastly, the company is dedicated to integrating AI across its product lines, and has invested approximately $20 billion in AI, with an estimated $4 billion invested in 2024 alone.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Blackrock's most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Positive factors include strong financials, significant AI investments (Apple Intelligence, iPhone 116 improvements), a prominent position on BlackRock's AI stock list, and the implicit endorsement from BlackRock's substantial investment in AI infrastructure. However, counterbalancing factors are significant. BlackRock's overall commentary expresses caution regarding excessive AI spending by tech firms and a shift towards diversification. JPMorgan's analysis highlights the high valuations of mega-cap tech stocks, suggesting a potential 'catch down' scenario if broader market AI adoption doesn't justify current valuations.  The article itself notes that BlackRock believes other AI stocks offer better short-term return potential. While Apple's AI initiatives are positive, the overall market sentiment and valuation concerns create uncertainty. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price rise, but with significant uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals and the inherent uncertainty in predicting short-term stock movements, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals but acknowledging the significant risk of a price fall given the market context. The trend of increasing probability of a price rise in previous prediction rounds is considered, but the inherent uncertainty remains.  The fact that the article highlights other AI stocks as potentially more promising further tempers the positive outlook."

Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's 'forever hold' stocks, emphasizing its strong financials, loyal customer base, and growth potential in services and AI. Previous predictions from various models generally show a positive outlook for Apple, with probabilities of the stock price rising ranging from 0.4 to 0.78, and probabilities of a fall ranging from 0.15 to 0.45. The consensus suggests that while there are concerns about valuation and market conditions, the overall sentiment is favorable due to Apple's strong fundamentals and growth initiatives. Considering this context, I estimate a moderately high probability of the stock price rising and a relatively low probability of it falling."

                                    "headline": "Why Is Cliff Asness Bullish On Apple Inc. (AAPL)?",
                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) The Best NASDAQ Dividend Stock To Buy?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Asness' endorsement and the company's growing revenue and services sector are positive indicators. However, the article also mentions that Asness predicts mediocre returns for the U.S. stock market in the next ten years, which could impact AAPL's stock price. Additionally, the article highlights the potential of AI stocks, which might affect AAPL's performance. Considering these factors and the mixed predictions from other models, I have taken a balanced approach to estimate the probabilities. The overall positive sentiment towards Apple's long-term growth and profitability, combined with Asness' endorsement, suggests a slightly higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling."

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan. According to the chipmaker, if the restrictions are implemented, they would not \u201cmitigate any threat\u201d but only \u201cweaken America\u2019s global competitiveness\u201d and undermine its innovation.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\u201cBy attempting to rig market outcomes and stifle competition\u2014the lifeblood of innovation\u2014the Biden Administration\u2019s new rule threatens to squander America\u2019s hard-won technological advantage\u201d.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). On the positive side, it highlights Cliff Asness's AQR Capital Management holding a significant stake in Apple, indicating confidence in the company. Furthermore, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its 'Outperform' rating with a price target of $250, and App Store revenue growth exceeded expectations. Apple's Q4 2024 revenue and product revenue also showed growth. However, the article also mentions that Madison Investments is underweight on Apple and believes that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for higher returns in a shorter timeframe. The article also mentions Asness's concerns about high CAPE ratios in the broader U.S. stock market, which could negatively impact Apple. Considering these factors, the positive signals slightly outweigh the negative ones, suggesting a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise than a fall. However, the article also suggests that other AI stocks may be more promising, which could temper enthusiasm for AAPL."

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop. If you\u2019re worried you\u2019ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it\u2019s too late.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

                                    "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.\n\nWith everyone competing towards supremacy in artificial intelligence, the latest country to intensify its efforts has been Britain. As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness.

The previous round predictions are mostly positive, with some models giving a high probability of stock price rise. Considering all these factors, I will give a slightly higher probability of stock price rise."

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities.

                                    "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, considering the aggregated opinions from various models, there seems to be a moderate to strong positive sentiment toward Apple. Models like openai/gpt-4o-mini, google/gemini-2.0-flash-001, and meta-llama/llama-4-scout suggest a higher probability of stock price rising, while deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324 and meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct express stronger confidence in the stock's upward trajectory. Despite these positives, other models like qwen/qwen-turbo highlight the speculative nature and difficulty in predicting long-term movements.

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness.

However, Madison Investments' underweight position and Asness's concerns about broader market valuations introduce some caution. Previous predictions are mixed but generally lean positive. Considering the positive signals from Asness's position and analyst ratings, balanced by the concerns about market conditions and alternative AI investments, I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise."

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. The following factors make Apple a prime investment opportunity. Firstly, the positive financial growth portrays a great picture of the company\u2019s stability that may attract investors. As per the reports of the third quarter of 2024, the firm generated nearly $27 billion in operating cash flow, allowing for a return of over $29 billion to shareholders. Secondly, the company has introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system integrated deeply into iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia. This comprises multiple highly capable generative models that are specialized for users\u2019 everyday tasks and can adapt on the fly to their current activities. Moreover, its newly launched iPhone 116 has improved Siri, advanced photo editing, and writing aids.

                                    "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy. According to the government, the technology could improve productivity by 1.5% a year, translating to an extra 47 billion pounds ($57 billion) annually over a decade.\n\n\u201cBritain will be one of the great AI superpowers. We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on Cliff Asness's bullish view on Apple, supported by AQR Capital Management's significant stake and Evercore ISI's positive rating. Apple's strong Q4 2024 performance and App Store revenue growth further reinforce this positive outlook. However, there are some counterpoints: Madison Investments is underweight on Apple, suggesting other AI stocks might be more attractive, and Asness has expressed concerns about high CAPE ratios in the broader market. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a general consensus of a slightly positive outlook. The positive signals from Asness's position and analyst ratings are balanced by concerns about market conditions and alternative AI investments. Therefore, I'm estimating a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While the author expresses long-term confidence in Apple, this is subjective opinion and doesn't provide new material information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term. The article highlights Apple's strengths (services segment, market position) and acknowledges challenges (slowing iPhone sales). However, no new financial data or significant events are revealed.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.4 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, reflecting the lack of concrete news in the article itself.  Considering the lack of new impactful information and the inherent volatility of the market, the probability of a price rise or fall due to this news alone is considered low. The slight positive sentiment expressed by the author is insufficient to significantly shift the probabilities from a neutral baseline.  The consensus from previous models, while leaning slightly positive, is not strong enough to justify a significant deviation from a near-even probability distribution."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

                                    "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

As reported by Reuters, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said on Monday, January 13th, that he wanted to make the UK an artificial intelligence \u201csuperpower\u201d. To reach this goal, the Prime Minister has promised to take a pro-innovation approach to regulation, make public data available to researchers, and create zones for data centers.\n\nREAD ALSO: Top 10 AI Stocks on Latest Analyst Ratings and News and 15 Important AI News and Ratings on Investors\u2019 Radar\n\nStarmer plans to make artificial intelligence a key part of his strategy to boost the economy.

We\u2019re going to make the breakthroughs, we\u2019re going to create the wealth, and we\u2019re going to make AI work for everyone in our country\u201d.\n\nAnother country that has been actively striving towards reaching supremacy when it comes to AI has been the US. In its latest efforts, the US government is moving to restrict artificial intelligence chip and technology exports further. Dozens of countries will be facing new restrictions on the export of advanced computer chips and other artificial intelligence (AI) technology. According to officials, the new rules are intended to make sure that \u201cthe world\u2019s AI runs on American rails\u201d and keep it out of the hands of \u201cmalicious actors\u201d who could use it to threaten the United States.\n\nEven though the US government may think it\u2019s heading in the right direction, many top tech companies don\u2019t necessarily agree.\n\n\u201cIn the wrong hands, powerful AI systems have the potential to exacerbate significant national security risks, including by enabling the development of weapons of mass destruction, supporting powerful offensive cyber operations, and aiding human rights abuses, such as mass surveillance\u201d.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia is also against these restrictions and will be the most impacted by the plan.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has strengthened its mark in the AI realm with the launch of Apple Intelligence, its personal intelligence system. However, one AI feature on the iPhone has been sparking mistrust and frustration amongst users. The feature, which summarizes user notifications through AI, has been spreading misinformation lately. It falsely claimed that British darts player Luke Littler had won the championship before it happened, also said that Tennis legend Rafael Nadal had come out as gay, and even reported that Luigi Mangione, the man arrested following the murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York, had shot himself. On January 6, Apple Inc. told CNBC that it was working on an update to resolve the problem. The company said it will be adding a clarification that shows when Apple Intelligence is responsible for the text displayed in the notifications. In more recent developments, BBC reported on January 17 that the company has suspended this new artificial intelligence (AI) feature for now, as it has been drawing criticism and complaints for making repeated mistakes in its news headlines\u2019 summaries.\n\n\u201cWe are working on improvements and will make them available in a future software update\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of must-watch AI stocks on investors\u2019 radar.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Stocks to Invest in According to Billionaire Cliff Asness.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks recommended by Cliff Asness.\n\nThe founder, managing principal, and chief investment officer of AQR Capital Management, Cliff Asness is a well-known name in the financial industry. Setting off with a $10 million commitment from a small group of investors in 1995, Asness managed to grow the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund's assets to over a $100 million in a matter of months. Distinct even among hedge fund managers, Cliff Asness' investment strategies, focusing on value and momentum strategies, have produced impressive outcomes for AQR Capital over the years. As an example, AQR's flagship Absolute Return fund had a spectacular year in 2022 after declining by over 30% from its peak in 2018. It rose 43.5%, the best performance since launch in 1998. The fund saw a 16.8% increase in 2021, and 18.4% in 2023, making it the best performing multi-strategy fund among its competitors. In its latest 13F filing for Q3 2024, AQR Capital Management disclosed a portfolio value $72.4 billion in 13F securities, with a top 10 holdings concentration of 14.07%.\n\nIn his interview for the book Efficiently Inefficient, Cliff Asness talks about the similarities between judgmental (discretionary) and quantitative investing, stating that both strategies look for cheap stocks with potential catalysts to raise or lower their values. He emphasized how quants use diversification and apply models across thousands of stocks to lower the risk factor, whereas judgmental investors tend to concentrate their holdings, thus relying on in-depth company knowledge. That said, Asness admitted that quant investors do go through periods of underperformance, even with the advantages of thorough data analysis.\n\nBitcoin: Little More Than a Speculative Bubble\n\nAsness has had much to say about Bitcoin over the years. According to the billionaire, the cryptocurrency remains in a speculative bubble after the post-election rally carried it over the $100,000 mark. Speaking on the cryptocurrency on CNBC's Money Movers, Asness stated the following:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on the bubble side, on net. To move me off that, you really need not a price change, but a use case. That\u2019s what could convince me to become maybe more of a crypto person when I find any use for it, aside from speculation and criminality.\u201d\n\nFollowing a massive year-end surge following president-elect Donald Trump's victory, Bitcoin surged 120% in 2024. With hopes of a national strategic Bitcoin reserve and pro-industry deregulation, investors expected Trump to bring about a golden age of crypto. Although Asness doesn't harbor good prospects for Bitcoin, he stated that he wouldn't short the cryptocurrency either, due to the volatile nature of crypto.\n\nStory Continues\n\nDespite proponents of Bitcoin contending that the cryptocurrency is here to stay and will eventually gain widespread acceptance, Asness' criticisms highlight the absence of real-world applications outside speculative investing. He still views Bitcoin cautiously because he thinks its legitimacy as a store of value and a medium of exchange has not been established. Along with his comments regarding Bitcoin, Asness also expressed his worries about the larger U.S. stock market, stating that high cyclically-adjusted price-to-earnings (CAPE) ratios will cause equities to struggle in the upcoming years. He predicts that during the following ten years, U.S. stocks will probably provide mediocre returns, with just slight outperformance over cash.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the ten best stocks to invest in according to Cliff Asness, we ranked all the stocks part of AQR Capital Managment's Q3 2024 13F SEC filings and picked the fund's top 10 stock holdings. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of AQR Capital Management's stake value.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAQR Capital Management's stake as of Q3: $1.87 billion\n\nGlobal tech behemoth Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is well-known for its flagship devices, which include the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its extensive network of services, including iCloud and Apple Music. Given that there are about 2.2 billion Apple devices around the globe, the company has a large platform suitable for launching its AI services.\n\nOn January 6, Evercore ISI reaffirmed its Outperform rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock, maintaining a price target of $250. Analysts noted that App Store revenue grew by 13% in December, down from November\u2019s 17% growth. However, the App Store's December quarter performance still delivered a 15% growth rate, surpassing Evercore ISI's initial forecasts. This stronger-than-expected showing is anticipated to bolster Apple's overall services revenue, where the App Store and payments from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) remain key contributors.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase compared to the same quarter the previous year. Product revenue reached nearly $70 billion, up from $67 billion in the same period in 2023. Moreover, the company reported an operating cash flow of $27 billion and paid $29 billion to shareholders.\n\nIn its third quarter 2024 investor letter, Madison Investments said the\u00a0following\u00a0regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL):\n\n\u201cAlphabet Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, Qualcomm Incorporated, Microsoft Corporation, and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) were the largest detractors. Apple has been volatile in the last quarter but ended on strength. Early in the quarter, Apple benefited from the introduction of their AI strategy, Apple Intelligence. They followed in September with the new iPhone 16, which also created some excitement. We are underweight to Apple, which has resulted in a headwind for performance.\u201d\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the stocks recommended by billionaire Cliff Asness. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a generally positive outlook for Apple (AAPL). It highlights Cliff Asness's bullish stance, supported by AQR Capital Management's significant stake. Evercore ISI's reaffirmed 'Outperform' rating and strong App Store revenue growth are also positive indicators. However, Madison Investments' underweight position and Asness's concerns about broader market valuations introduce some caution. The previous rounds of predictions show a trend of slightly positive sentiment. Considering these factors, the positive signals from Asness's position and analyst ratings are balanced by concerns about market conditions and alternative AI investments. Therefore, I'm estimating a higher probability of a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so. The trend in previous predictions also indicates a slight increase in the probability of a rise."

                                    "content": "Last year was one for the record books as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite each hit new record highs at multiple points throughout the year. Furthermore, the bull market continued to gain ground, passing its second anniversary in October, though it's taking a well-deserved breather as we head into 2025.\n\nClosing the door on the old and ringing in the new year is a great time for reflection, and as an avid investor, my first stop is usually my portfolio. One area I like to review is what stocks have emerged as my largest holdings and how they came to dominate my portfolio, as this can provide keen insight for the future.\n\nHere's a look at my five largest holdings heading into 2025 (as of market close on Jan. 13) and an important investing takeaway from each one.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia\n\nFishing, like investing, is rife with tales of \"the one that got away.\" Despite intentions to buy an intriguing stock, life gets in the way, and some development sends the stock soaring, notching gains of 100%, 500%, or even 1,000%. For me, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) was the whopper that got away.\n\nI owned shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) pioneer early in my investing career but sold them for tax-loss harvesting in 2010. I always intended to buy back into the company, but the stock was underwater for much of the next five years, so I had time. Then, the stock tripled in 2016, taking the wind out of my sails.\n\nHowever, by early 2018, I became intrigued again. Nvidia commanded a 70% share of the discrete desktop GPU market, experienced strong demand for cryptocurrency mining, and was making inroads in the self-driving car market. It was clear that CEO Jensen Huang had a knack for anticipating the next big thing and was adept at positioning Nvidia for success.\n\nAfter much research and even more soul searching -- and despite gains of more than 600% in just over two years and a pricey valuation -- I decided to buy Nvidia. I also added to my position numerous times in the ensuing years. Nvidia quickly became the gold standard when generative artificial intelligence (AI) went viral in early 2023, and my research -- and conviction -- paid off.\n\nSince that purchase in late March 2018, Nvidia has soared 2,200%, and the stock is now my largest holding, amounting to roughly 12% of my portfolio. Simply put, it's never too late to buy into an industry-leading company with a long track record of innovation -- even if the stock has gotten away from you.\n\nNetflix\n\nWhen I first began investing in late 2007, Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) was the very first stock I bought. I vividly remember cutting up my Blockbuster membership card after incurring a late fee that was more than the cost of the movie. Netflix conveniently delivered DVDs by mail without the hefty late charges. I was a happy customer, so buying the stock made perfect sense to me.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAt the time, streaming was still in its infancy, but Netflix dominated the DVD-by-mail space, and I was intrigued by its early, consistent market penetration and accelerating expansion. Since then, Netflix has become the undisputed king of streaming, with 283 million subscribers worldwide. The initial shares I purchased in 2007 have soared 34,540% and Netflix is my second-largest holding at 12% of my portfolio.\n\nGains of that magnitude only happened because I held the stock relentlessly, which is much more difficult than it sounds. Some shareholders bailed after the \"Qwikster\" fiasco of 2011, others lost confidence when Netflix lost 1.2 million subscribers in mid-2022, and still others balked at Netflix's foray into advertising. I held the stock through all those challenges and more.\n\nThe company tested investors' mettle many times over the years, but for those who recognized that the investing thesis hadn't changed and stayed the course, the rewards have been life-changing.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nYou'd be excused if you've never heard of MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI), as it isn't a household name in the U.S. However, from humble beginnings as an online auction platform, it has become the leading technology company in Latin America, providing digital retail and payment services to 18 countries in the region. MercadoLibre provides logistics and shipping services, cross-docking and warehousing, online payments, digital wallets, consumer and merchant financing, and more.\n\nSome investors have avoided the stock thanks to the inherent risks in the region, which include political instability, economic upheaval, and hyperinflation, among others. For example, Argentina, MercadoLibre's home country and one of its largest markets, had an inflation rate that soared 166% year over year in November, and that's just one of the challenges.\n\nYet those risks mask a sizable opportunity. While it's several years behind the U.S. in terms of penetration, its online retail and digital payments adoption rates are among the world's fastest-growing, with a population that's nearly twice that of the U.S. MercadoLibre takes a cut of each transaction hosted on its website, which insulates the company from much of the risk. During the first nine months of 2024, MercadoLibre's revenue grew 38% year over year, driving net income up 55%.\n\nUnderstanding the level of risk and the magnitude of the opportunity, I made the educated decision to buy this \"risky\" stock, a decision that has been extremely profitable. A modest initial investment in 2009 has grown by 7,900%. Combine that with several subsequent investments, and MercadoLibre accounts for roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nThis helps illustrate how education can help minimize risk.\n\nApple\n\nDespite numerous challengers over the past couple of years, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains the world's most valuable company and one of history's most successful. When the stock surpassed a $1 trillion market cap in 2018 -- and numerous times since then -- some investors believed that the company had reached its apex and there was very little upside from there.\n\nFurthermore, the iPhone is responsible for more than half of Apple's revenue, but as global smartphone penetration has crept higher, sales have begun to slow. Add to that the uncertain economy, and it's easy to understand some investors' misgivings.\n\nYet recent years have illustrated the resilience of Apple's services segment, which generated growth in each of the past four years despite the worst economic downturn in decades. The segment brought in revenue of $96 billion in fiscal 2024 (ended Sept. 30), more than 77% of the companies in the Fortune 500. Furthermore, even as iPhone sales slipped, Apple continued to top the global smartphone market, with the world's three top-selling models and four of the top 10, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\nSelling a stock too soon can be a costly investing mistake, as it certainly would have been with Apple. Since it became a charter member of the $1 trillion club in 2018, the stock has returned 350%, more than three times the 106% return of the S&P 500. Furthermore, since my first purchase in 2008, Apple's stock price has surged 4,120% to become my fourth-largest position, at roughly 8% of my portfolio.\n\nI'm convinced there's more to come.\n\nThe Trade Desk\n\nEvery once in a while, I find myself looking at a stock that has plunged, thinking, \"That can't be right.\" Such was the case with The Trade Desk(NASDAQ: TTD) in early 2020. It had long been among my highest-conviction stocks -- one I had been adding to for several years. The company was a digital advertising powerhouse and continued to gain market share, growing faster then the industry.\n\nImagine my surprise when -- during a four-week period between Feb. 19 and March 18, 2020 -- the stock lost 54% of its value. This wasn't due to any operational failure, malfeasance, or financial impropriety on The Trade Desk's part, but rather marked the start of the global pandemic. However, I had followed the company for years and was quite sure this was an overreaction on the part of investors.\n\nAfter checking to be sure nothing else had changed, I put my money where my mouth was and doubled my position in The Trade Desk. My logic was simple. The need for advertising wasn't going anywhere and the company had a demonstrated track record of using sophisticated algorithms to automate the ad-buying process, ensuring the right ads reached their target market. Furthermore, the stock was selling for half what it was just a month earlier, but the investing thesis hadn't changed.\n\nSince then, the stock has gained 717%, despite enduring the worst economic downturn in decades. Furthermore, since I first purchased The Trade Desk stock in March 2018, the stock has soared 2,349%. As a result, The Trade Desk is my fifth-largest holding heading into 2025, representing 7% of my portfolio.\n\nThe lesson here is a simple one. If the thesis hasn't changed, and a great company is selling at a discount, don't be afraid to buy on the dip.\n\nBonus lesson\n\nIf there's one overriding lesson that pervades this list, it's the compounding power of long-term buy and hold investing. Each of these stocks has been a staple in my portfolio for years. Nvidia and The Trade Desk are the most recent additions among the top five at nearly seven years, while I've owned Netflix shares for more than 17 years. There have been numerous instances when these stocks have lost between 25% and 50% of their value, but I resisted the common practice of jumping into and out of stocks, trying to time the peaks and valleys of the broader market.\n\nDoing nothing is one of the biggest keys to investing success.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While the author expresses long-term confidence in Apple, this is subjective opinion and doesn't provide new material information that would significantly impact Apple's stock price in the short term.  The article highlights Apple's strengths (services segment, market position) and acknowledges challenges (slowing iPhone sales). However, no new financial data or significant events are revealed.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting this lack of concrete news. The slight positive bias in some previous predictions is likely due to Apple's generally strong market position and reputation, rather than anything specific in this news piece. Therefore, the probability of a price movement directly attributable to this news is considered low.  The consensus from previous models, while leaning slightly positive, is not strong enough to justify a significant deviation from a near-even probability distribution. I'm giving slightly more weight to the possibility of a rise due to the generally positive long-term sentiment surrounding Apple, but the impact of this specific news is minimal."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, investment titan Blackrock released a commentary on the market outlook for artificial intelligence heading into the closing months of the year, stressing that investors were becoming cautious about the scale of AI spending by tech firms and thus diversifying investments into energy, utilities, real estate, and resources tied to AI infrastructure (for more on this click on 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock). Following this warning, in September 2024, BlackRock, in collaboration with Microsoft, Global Infrastructure Partners, and MGX, announced a new AI partnership aimed at investing in data centers and supporting power infrastructure. This initiative was part of a larger strategy by the investment firm to enhance American competitiveness in AI while meeting the growing need for energy infrastructure to power economic growth.\n\nThe investment giant also expanded product offerings to cater to the growing interest in AI. In October 2024, the firm launched two new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to provide investors with exposure to the burgeoning AI market. These ETFs aimed to capitalize on the increasing demand for AI-driven investment opportunities. Though still in their early stages, the initiatives appear to have paid off. BlackRock reported a net profit of $6.37 billion last year, marking a 16% increase from the previous year. Revenues rose by 14% to $20.4 billion, and assets under management expanded to $11.55 trillion. The firm has attributed a major part of this growth to advancements in AI technologies and projected that AI will be a significant driver of US equities and economic expansion in 2025.\n\nThe BlackRock Investment Institute notes that AI innovations are expected to outpace similar developments in Europe, with private markets playing a crucial role in funding AI-related infrastructure. BlackRock's 2025 Global Outlook suggests that the global economy has moved beyond the traditional boom and bust cycle due to transformative mega forces such as AI technologies, net-zero carbon emission efforts, geopolitical fragmentation, demographic shifts, and the digitization of finance. The firm believes that significant investments, akin to those of the Industrial Revolution, are needed, particularly in infrastructure tied to AI and green technology. The claims made by BlackRock in relation to AI are shared by investment firm JPMorgan.\n\nStory Continues\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 33 Most Important AI Companies You Should Pay Attention To and 20 Industrial Stocks Already Riding the AI Wave.\n\nAccording to a recent report on the topic by investment bank JPMorgan, investors should focus on opportunities that will prevail right along the AI value chain instead of focusing on obvious choices. Analysts at the bank have advised investors to weigh future potential earnings against what is already embedded in the price. Per JPMorgan, cheaper valuations and less demanding earnings expectations outside of mega cap tech stocks suggest that even AI bulls should be positioned for further broadening across sectors in 2025. The Investment Outlook 2025 report by JPMorgan takes a look at the soaring valuations of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks and their importance to the AI revolution. The bank highlights that while each of the companies in the Magnificent Seven are geared differently to the AI theme, this group of stocks now make up nearly 35% of the S&P 500 market cap and have driven over 70% of returns since the beginning of 2023.\n\nThis performance, compared against the rest of the market, has allowed for the expansion of valuations. JPMorgan underlines that while the rest of the S&P 500 trades on 12-month forward earnings multiple of 19x, the largest 10 stocks in the index now trade on 29x. Analysts led by Karen Ward, the Chief Market Strategist for EMEA at JPMorgan, contend that the valuation discrepancy between tech and the rest is unsustainable. The report stresses that if the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations already assumed for a handful of companies, the rest should catch up over time. It also cautions that if instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and is unwilling to pay for them, then a catch down scenario is more likely. However, when the strong fundamentals of these mega caps are compared to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as to the 2000s tech bubble, a catch down seems unlikely, it notes.\n\nJPMorgan broke down the AI revolution into five key areas. These were identified as AI hardware, AI hyperscalers, AI developers, AI integrators, and AI essentials. JPMorgan has warned that there is a substantial gap between the revenue expectations of hardware companies and the revenue growth that can be generated by the AI ecosystem. The bank has cautioned that this weakness can spread throughout the AI value chain. The report notes that the attention of investors has so far focused on AI hardware and AI hyperscalers, two areas of the AI industry more exposed to the technology and communication services sectors. Per JPMorgan, high levels of valuation dispersion in these categories suggest that opportunities for skilled stock pickers persist, but investors must recognize that any earnings disappointment could lead to substantial volatility.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 12 Best Quantum Computing Stocks To Invest In and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by consulting an investor note from prominent investment firm BlackRock.

                                    "headline": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
                                    "content": "\"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\n-- Warren Buffett, Berkshire Hathaway's 1998 Letter to Shareholders\n\nWarren Buffett has created incredible wealth for shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway. It's been very inspiring to individual investors that he did it -- as he alluded to in his 1988 letter to shareholders -- by focusing on investing in quality companies and holding for the long term, without being fazed by occasional market volatility.\n\nHere are two stocks from Berkshire's portfolio that can help you grow your savings for a richer retirement.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBerkshire has held a large position in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) since 2016. Despite recent sales in the stock, Buffett noted earlier in 2024 that Apple would likely remain Berkshire's largest holding by the end of the year. Indeed, Berkshire still held 300 million shares of the iPhone maker at the end of the third quarter, worth nearly $70 billion in market value. By comparison, Berkshire's next largest stock holding, American Express, was worth $41 billion.\n\nIn 2023, Buffett called Apple better than any business Berkshire owns, and it's easy to see why. Apple has a growing and loyal customer base, with many of the company's customers owning multiple devices. From January 2018 through the start of 2024, Apple's active installed base of devices increased from 1.3 billion to 2.2 billion.\n\nApple continues to attract new customers worldwide. In the most recent quarter, management reported that the active base hit another all-time high across all products and geographies.\n\nThis growth bodes well for the future of Apple's services business, which generates much higher profit margins than sales of hardware products. Apple has been focused on investing to expand the quality and variety of services in recent years, which has led to more than 1 billion paid subscriptions on the company's platform, and this is helping drive record revenue during a slow year for iPhone sales.\n\nApple's revenue grew 2% in fiscal 2024 ending in September to reach $391 billion, mostly driven by a 13% increase in services revenue. The introduction of Apple Intelligence could drive more upgrades, as it only runs on devices with a more recent processor. This remains a key catalyst for improving growth as Apple integrates artificial intelligence (AI) features across its products and services.\n\nThe high margins Apple generates from its products left the company with a massive $93 billion net profit last year. Apple has a lot of resources to reinvest in new products and services to drive long-term growth. The stock has gotten expensive over the past year, but if you start a position and dollar-cost average into it over time, you should earn solid returns.\n\nStory Continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBerkshire held 10 million shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) in Q3 and has held a position in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader since 2019. Amazon continues to grow its online retail business, while generating profitable moneymaking opportunities in other services.\n\nAmazon's massive lead in e-commerce, with 6 times the market share of its next closest competitor, positions it well for long-term growth. Recent trends in consumer spending have made it difficult for Amazon to maintain high rates of growth in its online store, but it's still showing a lot of potential. Lower selling prices are attracting more customers, as the growth in paid units accelerated to 12% year over year in Q3.\n\nUltimately, Amazon's advantage centers around its Prime membership program. All of the benefits Amazon continues to stack around Prime, including access to grocery delivery and medical prescriptions through RxPass, make it very difficult for customers to cancel their membership. Amazon said it had more than 200 million Prime members in 2021, but it's still growing. Paid membership growth accelerated in Q3, driving a year-over-year increase in subscription revenue of 11%.\n\nMost impressive about Amazon is its success developing profitable revenue streams outside of its core retail service, such as its cloud computing division (Amazon Web Services). Amazon originally developed its cloud service to support the growth of its online stores, but as it turned out, there was a huge market for this service outside of the company. Amazon Web Services is now generating annual revenue of $103 billion.\n\nThe profitable growth from cloud, and recent efforts to lower costs, helped Amazon bring in $50 billion in net income over the last year. Its continued investment in new fulfillment centers and AI capabilities shows there are still tremendous opportunities to grow and reward Amazon investors for many years.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, considering the aggregated opinions from various models, there seems to be a moderate to strong positive sentiment toward Apple.

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses challenges faced by Foxconn, a key Apple manufacturing partner, in expanding its operations in India.  These challenges include difficulties in transferring staff from China and importing machinery. While this news is potentially negative, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited for several reasons. First, the news focuses on operational challenges, not a fundamental change in Apple's business model or product demand. Second, Apple likely has multiple manufacturing partners and diversification strategies in place to mitigate risks associated with any single supplier. Third, the overall market sentiment towards Apple and the broader tech sector will likely play a more significant role in determining short-term price movements than this specific news. Therefore, the impact is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher probability of a minor negative impact than a positive one, but overall the effect is expected to be small."

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just got a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, landing on the firm's Tactical Outperform List. The call? Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside? The setup looks asymmetrically interesting.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news is predominantly positive for Apple. Evercore ISI's 'Tactical Outperform' rating and $250 price target suggest confidence in Apple's near-term performance, driven by emerging markets and stable demand. The potential for market share gains in China due to Huawei's issues is another positive factor. The focus on the iPhone 17 and the upcoming iPhone SE launch indicates strong future demand. The article also mentions that expectations are tempered, meaning Apple doesn't need to exceed expectations significantly to see positive stock movement. The 'asymmetrically interesting' setup further suggests more upside potential. However, the GuruFocus warning signs are a potential negative. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the most recent ones lean slightly positive. Given the overall positive sentiment and the potential for upside, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise."

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Foxconn's challenges in India is mildly negative for Apple.  While Foxconn is a major assembler, Apple likely has diversified its manufacturing base to mitigate risks from any single supplier. The impact on Apple's stock price is therefore likely to be small.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models highlighting positive factors like strong quarterly performance and others focusing on potential negative impacts from various unrelated news items.  Considering the limited direct impact of the Foxconn news and the overall mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining stable or experiencing a minor fluctuation rather than a significant rise or fall. The muted nature of the news, coupled with Apple's overall strong position, suggests a relatively low impact on the stock price."

However, the negative publicity and potential reputational damage could lead to minor short-term stock price volatility. Given Apple's strong market position and diversified revenue streams, the probability of a significant stock price fall is low, while the probability of a rise is also modest as the news is not directly tied to financial performance. Considering the previous predictions, which show a mix of slightly negative to neutral sentiment, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a balanced view with a slight edge towards a negative short-term impact."

Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

While there are mixed sentiments in previous predictions, the immediate concern is the regulatory environment and its implications for Apple's revenue from the app store. The possibility of a favorable resolution under the new administration could provide some upside, but the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future leads to a higher probability of a stock price fall. Overall, the diversified nature of Apple's business may mitigate long-term impacts, but the short-term outlook remains cautious."

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just got a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, landing on the firm's Tactical Outperform List. The call? Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside? The setup looks asymmetrically interesting.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news is generally positive for Apple. Evercore ISI's positive outlook, including the $250 price target and placement on the Tactical Outperform List, suggests confidence in Apple's near-term performance. The drivers include emerging market growth, stable demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's challenges. The focus on the iPhone 17 and the upcoming iPhone SE launch further supports future demand. The article highlights that expectations are already tempered, reducing the pressure on Apple to significantly exceed expectations. The 'asymmetrically interesting' setup implies more upside potential. However, the GuruFocus warning signs are a potential negative factor. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the most recent ones lean slightly positive. Given the overall positive sentiment and the potential for upside, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise. I am increasing the probability of stock price rise compared to the previous round, as the positive news is reinforced by the 'asymmetrically interesting' setup."

Apple likely has diversified its manufacturing base, mitigating the risk from any single supplier. The news itself doesn't represent a fundamental shift in Apple's business or product demand.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the influence of other news and market sentiment.  While some models highlight positive factors like strong quarterly performance and future product launches, others point to potential negative impacts from unrelated news.  Considering the limited direct impact of the Foxconn news and the overall mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'm assigning a probability slightly favoring a stable or slightly negative movement, reflecting the muted nature of the news and Apple's overall strong market position.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news mentions Warren Buffett's recommendation on stocks to buy and hold, specifically highlighting Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given Warren Buffett's reputation as a successful investor, his recommendations often carry significant weight among investors. This news might create positive sentiment around Apple, encouraging investors to hold onto the stock longer. However, considering various previous predictions which show a mix of neutral to slightly positive sentiments influenced by factors like market conditions, product launches, and operational challenges, the overall sentiment leans slightly positive but not overwhelmingly so. The recent round predictions also suggest a positive bias due to anticipated product launches and emerging market growth."

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

While there are mixed sentiments in previous predictions, the immediate concern is the regulatory environment and its implications for Apple's revenue from the app store. The possibility of a favorable resolution under the new administration could provide some upside, but the uncertainty surrounding TikTok's future leads to a higher probability of a stock price fall. Overall, the diversified nature of Apple's business may mitigate long-term impacts, but the short-term outlook remains cautious."

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just got a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, landing on the firm's Tactical Outperform List. The call? Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside? The setup looks asymmetrically interesting.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news is predominantly positive, driven by Evercore ISI's optimistic outlook, a $250 price target, and inclusion on their Tactical Outperform List. This is supported by emerging market growth, stable demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains in China due to Huawei's challenges. The focus on the iPhone 17 and the upcoming iPhone SE launch further bolsters future demand. The article also mentions that expectations are already tempered, reducing the pressure on Apple to significantly exceed expectations. The 'asymmetrically interesting' setup implies more upside potential. While the GuruFocus warning signs are a potential negative, the overall sentiment is positive. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which have become increasingly positive, I am assigning a high probability to a stock price rise. The positive news outweighs the potential negative factors."

Apple likely has diversified its manufacturing base, mitigating the risk from any single supplier.  The news does not represent a fundamental shift in Apple's business or product demand.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the influence of other news and overall market sentiment. Some models highlight positive factors like strong quarterly performance and future product launches, while others point to potential negative impacts from unrelated news.  The lack of detail in the premium article prevents a more definitive assessment. Considering the limited direct impact of the Foxconn news and the overall mixed sentiment from previous predictions, a neutral to slightly negative probability is assigned, reflecting the muted nature of the news and Apple's overall strong market position.

However, the negative publicity and potential reputational damage could lead to minor short-term stock price volatility.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration, with indirect mentions of Apple Inc. The launch of new AI safety tools by Nvidia is a positive development, but it does not directly impact Apple's stock price. Given the indirect mention of Apple and the lack of significant negative news, the probabilities of the stock price movement for Apple are estimated based on the general market sentiment and the fact that the news does not directly affect Apple's operations or outlook. Considering the previous predictions and the trend of others' beliefs, it seems that there is a mixed sentiment towards Apple's stock price movement. However, since the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, it is unlikely that it would have an immediate significant impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rise and fall are estimated to be relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards a neutral or stable market reaction."

Given Warren Buffett's reputation as a successful investor, his recommendations often carry significant weight among investors, creating a positive sentiment around Apple. The analysis from previous rounds shows a mix of sentiments, with some models leaning towards a positive view due to emerging market growth, stable demand for services and wearables, and potential market share gains in China. The recent rounds also reflect a positive bias due to anticipated product launches and positive sentiments from Evercore ISI's 'Tactical Outperform' rating. However, there are still concerns about regulatory uncertainties and short-term operational challenges. Taking these factors into account, there is a reasonable expectation that the positive sentiment will outweigh the negatives."

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

Overall, the diversified nature of Apple's business may mitigate long-term impacts, but the short-term outlook remains cautious."

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just got a fresh boost from Evercore ISI, landing on the firm's Tactical Outperform List. The call? Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside? The setup looks asymmetrically interesting.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

This is driven by emerging market growth, stable demand for Services and Wearables, and potential market share gains in China. The focus on the iPhone 17 and the upcoming iPhone SE launch further supports future demand. The article also mentions that expectations are already tempered, reducing the pressure on Apple to significantly exceed expectations. The 'asymmetrically interesting' setup implies more upside potential. While the GuruFocus warning signs are a potential negative, the overall sentiment is positive. Considering the trend of previous predictions, which have become increasingly positive, I am assigning a high probability to a stock price rise. The positive news outweighs the potential negative factors. Some models in previous rounds focused on unrelated negative news, but the core news here is strongly positive."

The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the consensus of previous predictions, which show a slight bias towards a negative short-term impact, but not a significant one.

Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news regarding TikTok's potential ban in the US and its implications for tech giants like Apple Inc. (AAPL) introduces uncertainty. The law requires Apple to remove TikTok from its app store, which could lead to a short-term loss of revenue. However, Apple has a diversified business, and TikTok's ban is not expected to have a significant long-term impact on the company's financials. The overall market sentiment and Apple's own performance will likely play a more significant role in determining the stock price movement. Given the mixed signals and potential for regulatory changes, there is a slightly higher chance of a stock price fall due to immediate uncertainty, but the impact is expected to be limited. Considering previous predictions, which show a mix of slightly negative to neutral sentiment, the probabilities are adjusted to reflect a balanced view with a slight edge towards a negative short-term impact."

                                    "reasoning": "The news article primarily focuses on Nvidia's unveiling of AI safety tools and its CEO's absence from the Trump inauguration, with indirect mentions of Apple Inc. The launch of new AI safety tools by Nvidia is a positive development, but it does not directly impact Apple's stock price. Given the indirect mention of Apple and the lack of significant negative news, the probabilities of the stock price movement for Apple are estimated based on the general market sentiment and the fact that the news does not directly affect Apple's operations or outlook. Considering the previous predictions and the trend of others' beliefs, it seems that there is a mixed sentiment towards Apple's stock price movement. However, since the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, it is unlikely that it would have an immediate significant impact on the stock price. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rise and fall are estimated to be relatively balanced, with a slight edge towards a neutral or stable market reaction."

Given Warren Buffett's reputation as a successful investor, his recommendations often carry significant weight among investors, creating a positive sentiment around Apple. The analysis from previous rounds shows a mix of sentiments, with some models leaning towards a positive view due to emerging market growth, stable demand for services and wearables, and potential market share gains in China. The recent rounds also reflect a positive bias due to anticipated product launches and positive sentiments from Evercore ISI's 'Tactical Outperform' rating. However, there are still concerns about regulatory uncertainties and short-term operational challenges. Taking these factors into account, there is a reasonable expectation that the positive sentiment will outweigh the negatives."

Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 1.4% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

                                    "headline": "What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday",
                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

The fact that Apple has slipped to third place in smartphone sales in China raises concerns about its competitive position. However, the slight rebound suggests that the market may have already priced in some of this negative news, and there may be optimism regarding upcoming quarterly earnings. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a significant chance of it falling due to the underlying concerns about sales performance."

The stock is flat since reporting and currently trades at $13.97.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Sonos here, it\u2019s free.\n\nMarket Update\n\nThanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

                                    "reasoning": "The provided news article offers a mixed perspective on Apple (AAPL). While Apple's Q3 revenue and operating income exceeded expectations, the overall consumer electronics sector faces challenges from technological change. Apple's stock has already risen 1.7% since the earnings release, suggesting some positive sentiment is already priced in. The broader market update mentions potential uncertainty in 2025 due to future rate cuts and potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight tilt towards a more conservative outlook. Some models highlighted the positive earnings beat, while others focused on potential headwinds and the fact that the stock has already seen a slight increase. Given the mixed signals and the already priced-in positive sentiment, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a further rise, but also acknowledging the risks."

                                    "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on TSMC's Arizona plant delays, indirectly impacting Apple. While TSMC is a key supplier, the delays are not immediately catastrophic. TSMC assures quality and prioritizes Taiwan for advanced chips, mitigating immediate supply chain risks for Apple.  Previous predictions are mixed, with some highlighting potential negative impacts from other news (China sales, general market uncertainty), while others see a potential for positive movement. The TSMC news is likely to have a minimal impact on Apple's stock price in the short term. Considering the mixed signals from previous predictions and the indirect nature of the TSMC news on Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a neutral outcome (no significant change) than a rise or fall.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall due to the overall positive sentiment around Apple in some of the previous predictions, despite the negative news about China sales."

This suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news, leading to a slight rebound.

Previous predictions also reflect this mixed outlook, with probabilities slightly favoring a rise or fall depending on the model. Considering the rebound as a potential short-term reaction and the ongoing challenges, the probabilities are balanced but with a slight tilt towards a negative impact due to the sales slump and competitive pressures."

                                    "headline": "What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday",
                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news discusses potential disruptions to the TikTok app due to regulatory issues, which may affect its availability on Apple's App Store. While the news primarily impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, it could indirectly influence Apple's stock price if the situation leads to public concern or regulatory scrutiny affecting the broader tech sector. However, Apple itself is not directly involved in the sale or divestiture of TikTok, and the company's core business of hardware and software ecosystems remains intact. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a moderate likelihood of either rising or falling, but the indirect nature of the news leans slightly towards a lower probability of significant movement."

This suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news, leading to a short-term positive reaction. However, the underlying concerns about competitive pressures and upcoming quarterly earnings create a mixed sentiment. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some models leaning towards a slight rise due to the rebound, while others highlight the risks associated with the sales slump. Overall, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also a notable chance of it falling due to ongoing concerns."

Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 1.4% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year. This print exceeded analysts\u2019 expectations by 2.5%. Overall, it was a very strong quarter for the company with EBITDA guidance for next quarter exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations and a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EPS estimates.Peloton Total Revenue\n\nInterestingly, the stock is up 28.8% since reporting and currently trades at $8.56.\n\nIs now the time to buy Peloton?

Overall, it was a strong quarter as it also produced a solid beat of analysts\u2019 EBITDA estimates.\n\nSonos pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat but had the slowest revenue growth among its peers. The stock is flat since reporting and currently trades at $13.97.\n\nRead our full, actionable report on Sonos here, it\u2019s free.\n\nMarket Update\n\nThanks to the Fed's series of rate hikes in 2022 and 2023, inflation has cooled significantly from its post-pandemic highs, drawing closer to the 2% goal. This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

                                    "reasoning": "The article presents a mixed view of Apple. While Q3 revenue exceeded expectations, the consumer electronics sector faces challenges. The stock has already risen 1.7% since the results. The market update mentions uncertainty in 2025. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight tilt towards a more conservative outlook. Some models highlighted the positive earnings beat, while others focused on potential headwinds and the fact that the stock has already seen a slight increase. Given the mixed signals and the already priced-in positive sentiment, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a further rise, but also acknowledging the risks. The fact that the stock has already moved up suggests less room for further immediate gains, but the earnings beat provides some support."

                                    "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on TSMC's Arizona plant delays, which indirectly impacts Apple as TSMC is a major supplier.  While the delays are concerning for TSMC, the impact on Apple is likely to be minimal in the short term. TSMC's statement that its Arizona facility matches Taiwan's quality and that Taiwan will receive the most advanced technology first mitigates immediate supply chain risks for Apple.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty around Apple's performance in China and broader market factors.  The TSMC news itself is not a major driver of Apple's stock price movement. Considering the indirect nature of the TSMC news and the mixed signals from previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to a price rise or fall. The slight lean towards a higher probability of a price rise reflects the overall positive sentiment around Apple in some previous predictions, despite negative news about China sales.  The probability of no significant change is likely higher than either a rise or fall."

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Synchrony Financial's (SYF) recent announcement to offer Apple Pay's Pay Later feature to its eligible cardholders, providing them with greater flexibility and convenience at checkout. This development is expected to boost the company's purchasing power and attract new customers, potentially leading to increased interest and fees on loans. Given SYF's strong digital and analytics expertise, as well as its partnerships with leading retailers, the introduction of this feature is likely to have a positive impact on the company's stock performance. However, the article does not provide a direct impact on Apple's (AAPL) stock price. Considering the positive implications of the partnership for SYF and the lack of direct impact on AAPL, I estimate the probability of AAPL's stock price rising due to this news as moderate, while the probability of the stock price falling is relatively low."

                                    "headline": "What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday",
                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news discusses potential disruptions to the TikTok app due to regulatory issues, which may affect its availability on Apple's App Store. While the news primarily impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, it could indirectly influence Apple's stock price if the situation leads to public concern or regulatory scrutiny affecting the broader tech sector. However, Apple itself is not directly involved in the sale or divestiture of TikTok, and the company's core business of hardware and software ecosystems remains intact. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a moderate likelihood of either rising or falling, but the indirect nature of the news leans slightly towards a lower probability of significant movement."

Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 1.4% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Previous predictions are mixed, with some highlighting the positive earnings beat, while others focused on potential headwinds and the fact that the stock has already seen a slight increase. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight tilt towards a more conservative outlook. The fact that the stock has already moved up suggests less room for further immediate gains, but the earnings beat provides some support. The iPhone sales slump in China is a concern, but the market may have already priced it in. Considering all these factors, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a further rise, but also acknowledging the risks."

                                    "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about TSMC's Arizona plant delays is indirectly relevant to Apple. While TSMC is a major supplier, the delays are not immediately catastrophic for Apple. TSMC's assurances about the Arizona plant's quality and its prioritization of Taiwan for advanced chips mitigate immediate supply chain risks.  The previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty around Apple's performance in China and broader market factors.  The TSMC news itself is unlikely to be a major driver of Apple's stock price movement in the short term. Considering the indirect nature of the TSMC news and the mixed signals from previous predictions, a neutral stance is warranted.  However, the slight positive sentiment from some previous predictions (due to Apple's earnings beat and other factors) and the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector (despite the China sales slump) slightly favors a higher probability of a price rise than a fall.  The probability of no significant change is likely higher than either a rise or fall, but the overall sentiment leans slightly positive."

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew said Friday that \u201cI want to thank President Trump for his commitment to work with us to find a solution that keeps TikTok available in the United States.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 1.4% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While Q3 revenue exceeded expectations, the consumer electronics sector faces challenges. The stock has already risen 1.7% since the results, suggesting some positive sentiment is priced in. The broader market update mentions uncertainty in 2025. Previous predictions are mixed, with some highlighting the positive earnings beat, while others focused on potential headwinds and the fact that the stock has already seen a slight increase. The iPhone sales slump in China is a concern, but the market may have already priced it in. Considering all these factors, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a further rise, but also acknowledging the risks. The trend of previous predictions shows a slight decrease in the probability of a rise, but I believe the positive earnings beat still provides some support."

                                    "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM) CEO C.C. Wei blamed slow U.S. permitting, strict construction rules, and labor shortages for delays at its Arizona plant, saying Taiwan will get the company's most advanced chip technology first.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with TSM.\n\n\"Every step required a permit, and after approval, it took twice as long as in Taiwan,\" Wei said Thursday at a National Taiwan University event. The Biden administration finalized a CHIPS Act deal last year, securing up to $6.6 billion in grants and $5 billion in loans to support TSMC's Arizona expansion.\n\nThe project promised $65 billion in private investment and expected to create thousands of jobs. Wei reassured investors on TSMC's earnings call, saying the Arizona facility matched Taiwan's quality. However, supply chain gaps and a shortage of skilled workers slowed progress. TSMC produces chips for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and AMD (NASDAQ:AMD).\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about TSMC's Arizona plant delays is indirectly relevant to Apple. While TSMC is a key supplier, the delays are not immediately catastrophic for Apple. TSMC's assurances about the Arizona plant's quality and its prioritization of Taiwan for advanced chips mitigate immediate supply chain risks.  However, the news adds to a backdrop of mixed signals for Apple.  There's been a reported drop in iPhone sales in China, and the overall consumer electronics sector faces challenges.  While Apple's recent earnings beat was positive, the stock has already seen some price increase, suggesting some of the positive news may be priced in.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's performance and the broader market.  Considering the indirect nature of the TSMC news, the mixed signals from other news, and the range of previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to a price rise or fall. The slight lean towards a higher probability of a price rise reflects the overall positive sentiment around Apple in some previous predictions (due to Apple's earnings beat and other factors) and the overall positive sentiment in the tech sector (despite the China sales slump).  The probability of no significant change is likely higher than either a rise or fall, but the overall sentiment leans slightly positive, though not strongly so."

On the other hand, the stock rebounded slightly after this news, suggesting some resilience or possibly priced-in expectations. Additionally, upcoming quarterly earnings and concerns over proposed Trump tariffs add uncertainty. Given the competing factors, the probability of a rise or fall is balanced but slightly tilted towards a negative sentiment due to the sales slump. Previous predictions also reflect this mixed outlook, with probabilities slightly favoring a rise or fall depending on the model. Considering the rebound as a potential short-term reaction and the ongoing challenges, the probabilities are balanced but with a slight tilt towards a negative impact due to the sales slump and competitive pressures."

                                    "headline": "What could happen to your TikTok app on Sunday",
                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Sunday?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President Joe Biden, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nTikTok could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users, as it threatened to do in a new statement Friday night, even though it is not obligated by law to do so.\n\nIt said \"TikTok will be forced to go dark\" without a \"definitive\" assurance from the Biden administration that the law would not be enforced and the companies that host and distribute the app wouldn't be punished.\n\nThe new warning came after the Supreme Court on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nHere is what the law actually requires: It will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nThe current White House has said that it will be leaving enforcement of the law to the Trump administration, which takes office mid day Monday, but TikTok said those statements aren't enough to assure service providers like Apple and Google that they won't be breaking the law.\n\nA president can push the Jan. 19 deadline by 90 days if TikTok's parent is making progress on a sale of the US operations.\n\nIf TikTok decides not to go dark and the law stays in place, its app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance.\n\nInstead \"the practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\" added Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nOver time, if the ban stays in place, TikTok's performance could weaken because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates. That becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\nStory Continues\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking,\" Schwartz said.\n\nThe immediate worry for TikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, is whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nOne possible option for Trump under the current law is that he determines that a \"qualified divestiture\" of TikTok's US operations has in fact taken place, a determination that the president has the leeway to make under the new law.\n\n\"Congress explicitly gave the president authority to certify that a [qualified] divestiture has taken place,\" said James Grimmelmann, professor at Cornell Law School.\n\n\"Trump could certify that TikTok has divested, whether it's true or not.\"\n\nBut such a scenario \"requires buy-in from both TikTok and ByteDance, which has said it does not intend to sell,\" added Sarah Kreps, Cornell University professor of government and law.\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling other unconventional ways to save TikTok from the impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news discusses potential disruptions to the TikTok app due to regulatory issues, which may affect its availability on Apple's App Store. While the news primarily impacts TikTok and its parent company ByteDance, it could indirectly influence Apple's stock price if the situation leads to public concern or regulatory scrutiny affecting the broader tech sector. However, Apple itself is not directly involved in the sale or divestiture of TikTok, and the company's core business of hardware and software ecosystems remains intact. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a moderate likelihood of either rising or falling, but the indirect nature of the news leans slightly towards a lower probability of significant movement."

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Despite being labeled as the weakest performer among its peers, the stock has seen a modest increase of 1.7% since the earnings announcement. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, as indicated by the average 1.4% rise in stock prices of peers, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the market's cautious outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Therefore, while there is a reasonable chance of the stock price rising, the potential for a decline remains due to broader market conditions."

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The news regarding the TikTok ban has mixed implications for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the ban itself doesn't directly harm Apple. In fact, it could be argued that it indirectly benefits Apple as it removes a competitor from the app store and potentially increases usage of other apps on iOS devices. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. The article mentions that Apple could face legal dilemmas if Trump delays enforcement of the law. This uncertainty could negatively impact investor sentiment. The article also mentions that Apple and Google could face penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. Overall, the news is slightly negative for Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited."

This is negative news and would typically lead to a stock price decline. However, the headline also mentions a slight rebound in the stock price *after* the initial report. This suggests that the market may have already priced in some of the negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors, such as upcoming earnings reports.  The mention of Trump tariffs and Asian competition adds further uncertainty.  The rebound suggests the market's reaction is not solely driven by the China sales slump.  Given the mixed signals and the upcoming earnings report, which could significantly impact the stock price regardless of the China sales figures, predicting a definitive price movement is difficult.  Therefore, the probabilities are assigned to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the negative sales data but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to other market factors and the potential for positive earnings news."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest.

However, the news does not directly mention Apple Inc. (AAPL). The information about Microsoft's AI spending and its stock performance does not have a direct correlation with Apple's stock price movement. Apple's recent stock performance has been influenced by concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market, as mentioned in the article. Given that the news does not provide any direct information about Apple, we should consider the probabilities of stock price movement based on the context provided. Apple's stock has already faced downward pressure due to its own issues, and without any directly related negative news, the probability of a further fall might be relatively lower compared to a rise, which is speculative without a clear positive catalyst."

Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas.

But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban.

Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 1.4% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

However, the cautious market outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm.

However, the article also mentions that the ban could benefit Meta and YouTube, which are competitors to TikTok. The uncertainty surrounding the ban and potential legal challenges, as well as the possibility of Trump intervening, creates volatility. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment towards Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited. Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling."

A decline in iPhone sales in China is undeniably negative, and several previous models correctly pointed out the potential for a stock price drop due to this. However, the headline also notes a slight rebound after the initial report. This suggests the market may have already partially priced in the bad news, or that other factors are at play.  The upcoming earnings report is a significant wildcard; strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative China sales data.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  While the China sales slump is a concern, the rebound and upcoming earnings report make a definitive prediction difficult.  I'm leaning slightly towards a rise, acknowledging the risk of a fall, but giving more weight to the potential for positive earnings news to offset the negative sales data and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news already."

This could disrupt Apple's supply chain and production timelines, potentially leading to delays or increased costs. Such disruptions are generally viewed negatively by investors, as they can impact revenue and profitability.

Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with most models assigning a higher probability to a decline. Therefore, the stock price is more likely to face downward pressure due to this news."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q3 earnings report showed a revenue increase of 6.1%, which exceeded analysts' expectations, indicating a solid performance despite being labeled the weakest among its peers. The overall positive sentiment in the consumer electronics sector, with an average rise of 1.4% in peer stock prices, suggests that Apple may benefit from this trend. However, the cautious market outlook due to potential future rate cuts and economic uncertainties could temper enthusiasm. Additionally, concerns over iPhone sales in China and the potential impact of regulatory changes related to TikTok create a mixed sentiment. Given these factors, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising, but also acknowledge the potential for a decline due to broader market conditions and specific challenges Apple faces."

                                    "headline": "TikTok loses Supreme Court battle to stop US ban",
                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on the Supreme Court upholding a potential TikTok ban in the US, which has indirect implications for Apple. While Apple isn't directly targeted, the ban affects its App Store. The law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and Oracle host the app. Penalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.

However, the impact is likely to be limited. Considering the previous predictions, there's a slight negative sentiment towards Apple due to the uncertainty and potential legal challenges, but the impact is likely to be limited.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The reported slump in iPhone sales in China is undeniably negative, and this is reflected in the initial market reaction. However, the subsequent rebound suggests that the market may have already partially priced in this negative news, or that investors are focusing on other factors.  The upcoming earnings report is a crucial wildcard; strong earnings could easily offset the negative China sales data.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future movement.  While the China sales slump is a concern, the rebound, the upcoming earnings report, and the fact that the stock has already experienced a significant drop, lead me to believe that the probability of a further significant drop is lower than a rise or sideways movement.  The probabilities are weighted to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the potential for positive earnings news and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

(Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas.

Whether it\u2019s speakers for the home or specialized cameras to document everything from a surfing session to a wedding reception, these businesses are trying to provide innovative, high-quality products that are both useful and cool to own. Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3. As a group, revenues beat analysts\u2019 consensus estimates by 1.8% while next quarter\u2019s revenue guidance was 2.3% below.\n\nIn light of this news, share prices of the companies have held steady as they are up 1.4% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nPeloton (NASDAQ:PTON)\n\nStarted as a Kickstarter campaign, Peloton (NASDAQ: PTON) is a fitness technology company known for its at-home exercise equipment and interactive online workout classes.\n\nPeloton reported revenues of $585.9 million, down 1.6% year on year.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

The earnings report is a crucial wildcard; strong earnings could easily offset the negative China sales data.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. While the China sales slump is a concern, the rebound, the upcoming earnings report, and the potential for other positive news (e.g., strong performance in other markets) make a definitive prediction difficult.  Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, acknowledging the risk of a fall, but giving more weight to the potential for positive earnings news and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news.

Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

Given that the news does not provide any directly related information about Apple's future performance, we must consider the context of Apple's recent stock performance and market concerns. The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions, but generally, there is a cautious outlook due to iPhone sales concerns and market uncertainties.

This decline, combined with the loss of market share to competitors Huawei and Vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. However, considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the stock's future movement. The market may have already partially priced in this negative news, and the upcoming earnings report could be a significant wildcard.

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

Adding to the degree of difficulty for these companies is technological change, where the latest smartphone could disintermediate a whole category of consumer electronics. Companies that successfully serve customers and innovate can enjoy high customer loyalty and pricing power, while those that struggle with these may go the way of the VHS tape.\n\nThe 4 consumer electronics stocks we track reported a very strong Q3.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, it doesn't directly harm Apple, and could even indirectly benefit it by removing a competitor from the app store. However, the uncertainty surrounding the ban, potential legal challenges, and the possibility of Trump intervening create volatility. The article mentions that Apple could face legal dilemmas if Trump delays enforcement of the law, and potential penalties for violations of the ban, which could negatively impact investor sentiment. The previous rounds of predictions show a slight trend towards a negative outlook. Considering all these factors, I believe the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising."

This is compounded by the ongoing concerns about competition from Asian manufacturers and the potential impact of any TikTok ban.  However, the initial negative market reaction was followed by a rebound, suggesting that some of the bad news may already be priced in.  Furthermore, the upcoming earnings report is a major unknown; strong earnings could easily outweigh the negative China sales data.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty.  While the China sales slump is a serious concern, the rebound, the upcoming earnings report, and the fact that the stock has already experienced a significant drop, lead me to believe that the probability of a further significant drop is lower than a rise or sideways movement.  I'm giving more weight to the potential for positive earnings news to offset the negative sales data and the market's apparent partial absorption of the bad news.  The consistent prediction of a price fall by several models, however, warrants caution."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas.

But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban.

He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

While the removal of TikTok may lead to a shift in user engagement and advertising revenue towards competitors like Instagram and YouTube, it also raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

These challenges include difficulties in transferring staff from China and importing machinery. While this news is potentially negative, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited for several reasons. First, the news focuses on operational challenges, not a fundamental change in Apple's business model or product demand. Second, Apple likely has multiple manufacturing partners and diversification strategies in place to mitigate risks associated with any single supplier. Third, the overall market sentiment towards Apple and the broader tech sector will likely play a more significant role in determining short-term price movements than this specific news. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is considered low.  The probability of a price rise is also low, as the news is not inherently positive.

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

While the ban primarily affects TikTok, it raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store. This could lead to a loss of revenue from TikTok and a shift in user engagement towards competitors like Instagram and YouTube. The overall sentiment appears to be negative due to the uncertainty surrounding the legal implications and potential revenue loss.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

(Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone. However, Apple also paid dividends during these 10 years.\n\nApple's dividend yield is currently 0.43%. Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%. In comparison, S&P 500 total return for the same period is 228.10%.\n\nSee Also: If there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it?\n\nWhat Could The Next 10 Years Bring?\n\nApple has a consensus rating of \"Buy\" and a price target of $245.17 based on the ratings of 30 analysts.

The consensus rating is 'Buy' with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, the article also notes that growth-focused investors might not find the stock attractive due to the modest expected upside, and income-focused investors might be deterred by the low dividend yield. Given the positive earnings expectations and historical performance, the probability of a stock price rise is higher, but the limited upside and low dividend yield could temper enthusiasm. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some leaning towards a negative impact due to unrelated news (e.g., TikTok ban, Foxconn challenges), but the direct news about Apple is more neutral to slightly positive. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall."

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

                                    "reasoning": "The news regarding the potential ban of TikTok in the US introduces significant uncertainty for Apple Inc. While the ban primarily affects TikTok, it raises concerns about legal risks for Apple, as it may have to remove TikTok from its app store. This could lead to a loss of revenue from TikTok and a shift in user engagement towards competitors like Instagram and YouTube. The overall sentiment appears to be negative due to the uncertainty surrounding the legal implications and potential revenue loss. Previous predictions from various models indicate a higher probability of stock price decline, reflecting investor concerns about the implications of the TikTok ban and its impact on Apple's business. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter.

Considering the negative pressure on Apple due to iPhone sales concerns and the mixed sentiment from previous predictions, I'll slightly favor a higher probability of a fall. The fact that Microsoft is struggling with AI adoption might have a very minor positive impact on Apple, but the negative news regarding Apple's performance is more significant."

The lack of detail in the premium article prevents a definitive assessment of the impact. The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting uncertainty and the influence of other unrelated news items (TikTok ban, broader market sentiment).  While some models consistently predict a higher probability of a fall, others maintain a more neutral or even slightly positive outlook.  Considering the limited direct impact of the Foxconn news and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability to both a rise and a fall, slightly leaning towards a fall due to the negative news, but acknowledging the potential for the impact to be minimal.  The overall market sentiment and other macroeconomic factors will likely have a much larger influence on Apple's stock price than this specific news item.  The consistent prediction of a higher probability of a fall in the previous rounds, even with unrelated news, suggests a prevailing negative sentiment that should be considered."

Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

The previous predictions suggest varied sentiments about Apple's stock price, ranging from slightly negative to positive.

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The Supreme Court's decision to uphold the US ban on TikTok unless it is sold to a non-foreign adversary owner could have mixed implications for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face operational challenges as it would be required to remove TikTok from its App Store, potentially affecting its service revenue. On the other hand, the ban could benefit Apple indirectly by reducing competition in the social media space, possibly leading to increased usage of other apps available on Apple devices. Additionally, the uncertainty around enforcement and potential executive actions by President-elect Trump adds complexity. Overall, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely neutral to slightly positive, given its diversified revenue streams and the potential for increased engagement on other platforms."

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Synchrony Financial (SYF) introducing the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay for its eligible cardholders could have a positive impact on the company's stock price. The introduction of this feature provides greater flexibility and choice to customers, potentially increasing the usage and popularity of Synchrony's credit cards. This move could lead to increased interest and fees on loans, which is a primary revenue source for SYF. Additionally, the partnership with Apple and the integration of Apple Pay with Synchrony's credit cards could enhance customer experience, leading to increased loyalty and spending. However, the stock's performance also depends on various other factors such as overall market conditions, competition, and the company's ability to manage risks associated with its lending business. The recent performance of SYF, with shares gaining 89.6% in the past year, indicates a strong growth trajectory. The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for SYF and the positive outlook for its earnings and revenue growth suggest that the stock might have a stable or positive movement in the near term."

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

The uncertainty surrounding enforcement and potential legal complications adds to the risk.

The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones.

Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm.

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline discusses Synchrony Financial (SYF) offering greater flexibility with Apple Pay's Pay Later feature, which is more directly related to SYF than AAPL. However, the increased flexibility and payment options could potentially boost Apple Pay usage, thereby indirectly benefiting Apple Inc. (AAPL). Given that Apple Pay is just one of many revenue streams for Apple and the news primarily focuses on SYF, the direct impact on AAPL's stock price is likely to be moderate. The overall market conditions and other factors influencing Apple's stock will play a more significant role. Therefore, the probability of AAPL's stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but not significantly so."

Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside? The setup looks asymmetrically interesting.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The potential for a major redesign with the iPhone 17 and the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March could keep demand strong.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism about Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of a rise. However, it's essential to note that the stock market can be volatile, and various factors can influence the stock price. Based on the analysis, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

While this is a positive development for SYF, its impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect. Increased Apple Pay adoption could slightly boost Apple's revenue, but Apple Pay is just one of many revenue streams. The previous round of predictions shows a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning slightly towards a positive impact. Considering the limited direct impact on Apple and the overall market conditions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not significantly so. The trend of previous predictions also shows a slight increase in optimism."

And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas.

The possibility of a delay, sale of TikTok, or President-elect Trump's intervention are mitigating factors.  Furthermore, the removal of TikTok could potentially lead to increased usage of other apps on Apple's platform.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong financial position, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is relatively low.  However, the immediate negative impact of removing TikTok, coupled with the general uncertainty, slightly favors a higher probability of a minor price decrease.  The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the immediate uncertainty and potential for negative market reaction, but the impact is likely to be short-lived and relatively small given Apple's overall strength."

The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

The potential for a major redesign with the iPhone 17 and the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March could keep demand strong. Additionally, Apple's ability to gain market share due to Huawei's chip supply issues and the overall stable demand for iPhones despite some discounts in China contribute to the positive sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism about Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of a rise. Based on the analysis, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple. While the direct impact on Apple's revenue from losing TikTok from its App Store is likely relatively small compared to its overall revenue streams, the uncertainty surrounding the situation and potential legal challenges could create market volatility.  The possibility of a delay, sale of TikTok, or President-elect Trump's intervention are mitigating factors.  Furthermore, the removal of TikTok could potentially lead to increased usage of other apps on Apple's platform. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty. Considering Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong financial position, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is relatively low. However, the immediate negative impact of removing TikTok, coupled with the general uncertainty, slightly favors a higher probability of a minor price decrease. The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the immediate uncertainty and potential for negative market reaction, but the impact is likely to be short-lived and relatively small given Apple's overall strength.  The trend of previous predictions shows a slight increase in optimism, but the uncertainty remains high.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the immediate uncertainty and potential for negative market sentiment."

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

The uncertainty surrounding enforcement and potential legal complications adds to the risk. On the positive side, the ban could indirectly benefit Apple by reducing competition in the social media space, possibly leading to increased usage of other apps available on Apple devices. Additionally, Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong market position mitigate some of the negative impacts. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price decline is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate given Apple's resilience and the broader market context."

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

While Apple is not directly responsible for TikTok's operations, the requirement to remove the app from its App Store could lead to a decrease in user engagement and app ecosystem dynamics. The uncertainty surrounding the enforcement of the ban and the potential for political intervention adds to the volatility. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams and the possibility of increased engagement on other platforms may mitigate the negative impact. Overall, the probabilities reflect a cautious outlook with a slight inclination towards a stock price decline due to the immediate implications of the TikTok ban."

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

This is primarily beneficial for SYF, but it could indirectly benefit Apple (AAPL) by increasing Apple Pay usage. However, Apple Pay is just one of Apple's many revenue streams, so the impact is likely to be moderate. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight trend towards a more positive outlook, but opinions remain mixed. Given the indirect nature of the benefit and the overall market conditions, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a rise than a fall, but not significantly so. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, but there is a general trend of slightly higher probabilities of the stock price rising."

Furthermore, the removal of TikTok could potentially lead to increased usage of other apps on Apple's platform.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty.  Considering Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong financial position, the probability of a significant stock price movement in either direction is relatively low.

Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about the potential TikTok ban creates a complex scenario for Apple Inc. (AAPL). On one hand, Apple may face operational challenges and potential revenue loss from removing TikTok from its App Store. On the other hand, the ban could indirectly benefit Apple by reducing competition in the social media space, possibly leading to increased usage of other apps on Apple devices. Apple's diversified revenue streams and strong market position mitigate some of the negative impacts. The uncertainty surrounding enforcement and potential legal complications adds to the risk. Previous predictions show mixed sentiments, with some models leaning towards a slight negative impact due to immediate uncertainty, while others consider Apple's resilience and diversified revenue. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price decline is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be moderate given Apple's strong financial position and the broader market context."

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear. Plus, with Huawei running into chip supply issues, Apple could quietly scoop up market share. Evercore is sticking with its $250 price target, expecting gross margins to hold steady at 66%-67%.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with HOOD.\n\nBut the real story isn't this quarterit's what's coming next. Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign. That, along with the upcoming iPhone SE launch in March, could keep demand strong heading into the back half of the year. While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience. A solid print, combined with anticipation for the iPhone 17 and a better-than-feared China update, could be enough to keep the stock moving higher. Investors looking for upside?

                                    "content": "The US Supreme Court ruled to uphold the law banning TikTok in the US unless the company sells to a non-adversary by January 19. If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban. Kulkarni suggests that money \"would just follow the waterfall of the market share.\" Related Videos\n\n03:51\n\nCould Trump save TikTok as Supreme Court decision looms?\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 20 hours ago 03:13\n\nTikTok ban is 'parallel' to Trump's earlier Huawei concerns\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 05:25\n\nMicrosoft unveils updated CoPilot for enterprise customers\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 01:38\n\nTikTok calls reports of sale to Elon Musk 'pure fiction'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nIn particular, he posits, \"Google and Facebook [are] the biggest market share companies; most likely, advertisers would probably take that money away from TikTok and go back to those two.\"\n\n\"The reality is that Apple and Google will likely remove TikTok from the app store, which means in the next month or so, users are going to be in a limbo, advertisers are going to be in a limbo,\" Kulkarni explains.\n\nAdditionally, Kulkarni suggests Trump could use TikTok as leverage in US-China negotiations.\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Josh Lynch\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news regarding the TikTok ban presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, Apple faces legal risks and potential negative publicity if it removes TikTok from its app store, potentially impacting user sentiment and brand image. This could lead to a slight negative impact on the stock. On the other hand, the removal of TikTok could indirectly benefit Apple by increasing user engagement and app downloads for competing platforms available on the App Store, potentially driving revenue. However, this benefit is indirect and less certain. The analyst's comments highlight the uncertainty and potential limbo period for users and advertisers, which could create short-term volatility. Given these factors, the overall impact on Apple's stock is likely to be slightly negative or neutral in the short term. The negative sentiment associated with potential legal risks and the uncertainty surrounding the transition of users and ad revenue outweigh the potential indirect benefits."

While this is positive, it's primarily historical data and doesn't directly predict future price movements.  The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the relatively low projected upside and the lack of significant new information driving a substantial price change, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small increase due to the analyst price target."

Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

While this is positive, it offers little predictive power for future price movements. The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, suggesting a modest 4% upside. This is a mildly bullish signal, but not strong enough to significantly influence the probability of a price rise.  The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income investors. Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive. However, the overall lack of significant new information impacting Apple's fundamentals makes a substantial price change unlikely in the short term. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock prices. Considering the limited predictive value of the news and the modest analyst target, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small increase."

This decline, combined with Huawei and Vivo overtaking Apple in market share, suggests a negative impact on Apple's revenue and market position. Considering the previous predictions, most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The decline in sales and loss of market share are significant indicators of potential financial impact. While Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may help mitigate the impact of this decline, the overall trend suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling."

                                    "reasoning": "The provided news article is largely retrospective, focusing on Apple's strong past performance over the last 10 years. While this is positive, it doesn't offer strong predictive power for future price movements.  The analyst consensus price target of $245.17 suggests a modest 4% upside, a mildly bullish signal but not a strong one.  The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income investors.  Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive. However, there's no significant new information presented that would drastically alter market sentiment.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock price prediction. Considering the limited predictive value of the news and the modest analyst target, and the lack of any significantly negative news, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small increase.  The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, but the lack of strong drivers for a significant price movement makes a large increase or decrease unlikely."

Previous predictions from other models generally lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling due to the sales slump, though some models noted the rebound as a mitigating factor.

(AAPL) but could imply a competitive landscape for streaming services. Given that the news does not provide any specific information that would directly impact Apple's stock price positively or negatively, we can infer that the impact on AAPL is likely to be neutral or minimal. However, considering the broader implications of streaming services and potential competitive pressures, there might be a slightly negative implication for Apple TV+ if it fails to keep up with similar strategies. The previous predictions show a range of opinions but generally indicate a cautious or slightly negative outlook due to competitive pressures and regulatory risks in the tech industry."

Considering the previous predictions, most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The decline in sales and loss of market share are significant indicators of potential financial impact. While Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may help mitigate the impact of this decline, the overall trend suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling. Given the consistent negative sentiment across previous predictions and the significant decline in iPhone sales in China, the estimated probabilities reflect a higher chance of the stock price falling."

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for Apple. While Apple doesn't directly benefit from TikTok's revenue, the removal of TikTok from the App Store could create a negative perception and potentially lead to user dissatisfaction. The analyst's comments highlight the uncertainty and potential limbo period for users and advertisers, which could create short-term volatility. The previous rounds of predictions show a generally negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty surrounding the TikTok ban. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising. However, the potential for increased engagement on other apps in the app store could offset some of the negative impact. Considering the trend of previous predictions, I will stick to the negative sentiment."

While this is positive, it doesn't offer strong predictive power for future price movements. The analyst consensus price target of $245.17 suggests a modest 4% upside, a mildly bullish signal but not a strong one. The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income investors. Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive. However, there's no significant new information presented that would drastically alter market sentiment.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the inherent uncertainty in short-term stock price prediction.  The consistent negative sentiment regarding the potential TikTok ban and the decline in iPhone sales in China are significant factors to consider.  While the earnings beat is positive, the overall lack of strong positive drivers and the presence of negative factors suggest a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation than a significant rise.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the balance between positive and negative factors and the overall uncertainty."

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "What happens on your smartphone once a US law banning the social media app TikTok takes effect on Jan. 19?\n\nIt will depend on the actions of TikTok parent ByteDance, President-elect Donald Trump, and some of the largest tech giants in the US.\n\nByteDance could voluntarily shut down use of the app for US users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

The previous rounds of predictions show a generally negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty surrounding the TikTok ban. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than rising. However, the potential for increased engagement on other apps in the app store could offset some of the negative impact. Considering the trend of previous predictions, I will stick to the negative sentiment.

The analyst consensus price target of $245.17 suggests a modest 4% upside, a mildly bullish signal, but not a strong one. The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income investors.  Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive. However, there's no significant new information presented that would drastically alter market sentiment.  The previous predictions show a consistent negative bias, primarily driven by concerns about declining iPhone sales in China and the uncertainty surrounding a potential TikTok ban. While the earnings beat is positive, the consistent negative sentiment across multiple models and the lack of strong positive drivers outweigh the modest positive signals.

Considering the previous predictions, most models predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to this news. The decline in sales and loss of market share are significant indicators of potential financial impact. While Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong brand and loyal customer base, which may help mitigate the impact of this decline, the overall trend suggests a higher likelihood of the stock price falling."

Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas.

But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban.

Given the overall positive sentiment around AI advancements and the potential for reduced regulation, there is a moderate probability that Apple's stock price may rise. Conversely, concerns about tariffs and regulations could negatively impact the stock, but these concerns are more speculative at this stage.

The fact that Apple is actively working on improvements and plans to reintroduce the feature suggests a commitment to AI and a proactive approach to addressing issues. The negative impact is mitigated by the fact that the feature is in beta, and Apple is addressing concerns raised by news organizations. The overall impact is likely to be minor, as the AI news feature is a small part of Apple's overall business. However, the negative publicity and potential damage to Apple's reputation for quality could exert some downward pressure. Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's response, the probability of a significant stock price drop is relatively low.

Apple is set up to deliver a solid quarter, riding on emerging market growth and steady demand for Services and Wearables. The wildcard is Chinawhile some iPhone weakness has raised eyebrows, analysts see that as a low bar to clear.

Evercore sees investors shifting focus to the iPhone 17, which is rumored to bring a major redesign.

While Apple has offered some discounts on iPhone 16 in China, overall demand looks stable, thanks to emerging markets picking up the slack.\n\nWith expectations already tempered, Apple doesn't need to blow the doors off this quarterit just needs to show resilience.

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

The negative impact is mitigated by the fact that the feature is in beta, and Apple is addressing concerns raised by news organizations. The overall impact is likely to be minor, as the AI news feature is a small part of Apple's overall business. However, the negative publicity and potential damage to Apple's reputation for quality could exert some downward pressure. Given the limited scope of the issue and Apple's response, the probability of a significant stock price drop is relatively low. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of fluctuation.

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas.

One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential ban on TikTok presents a complex scenario for Apple.  While the immediate impact might seem negative due to the potential loss of TikTok from the App Store and associated revenue, the probability of a significant drop is mitigated by several factors.  Firstly, Apple's revenue is highly diversified; the loss of TikTok's presence is unlikely to be catastrophic. Secondly, there's significant uncertainty regarding the actual enforcement of the ban.  Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement, or a sale of TikTok's US operations, could completely negate the negative impact.  The potential for legal challenges further adds to the uncertainty.  Finally, the news focuses heavily on the benefits to competitors like Meta, suggesting a potential redistribution of advertising revenue rather than an overall contraction of the market.  Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term. The long-term impact is even more uncertain and depends heavily on the resolution of the TikTok situation."

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple.  While the immediate impact could be negative due to the potential loss of TikTok from the App Store and associated revenue, the severity is mitigated by several factors. Apple's revenue is highly diversified; the loss of TikTok is unlikely to be catastrophic.  Significant uncertainty surrounds the ban's enforcement. Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement, or a sale of TikTok's US operations, could negate the negative impact.  Legal challenges add further uncertainty. The news highlights benefits to competitors like Meta, suggesting revenue redistribution rather than market contraction.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting this uncertainty.  While a short-term negative impact is possible, the probability of a significant drop is low given Apple's diversification and the numerous potential outcomes. The long-term impact is highly uncertain and depends heavily on the resolution of the TikTok situation.  Therefore, the probabilities reflect a slight bias towards a price fall, acknowledging the potential for a relatively small negative impact in the short term, but with significant uncertainty regarding the long-term effects."

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

                                    "reasoning": "The news primarily focuses on Nvidia's advancements in AI safety tools and the potential impact of the upcoming Trump administration on semiconductor regulations. While these developments are significant for Nvidia, the direct implications for Apple Inc. are less clear. The mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration suggests a favorable environment for tech stocks, which could positively influence Apple's stock. However, concerns about potential tariffs and regulations under the new administration could exert downward pressure. Given the mixed signals from the news and the previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, but with a notable chance of a fall due to regulatory concerns."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) has paused its artificial intelligence (AI) tool that summarises news headlines after a number of errors drew complaints from news organisations and campaigners.\n\nOn Thursday, the tech giant released a beta software update to developers which disabled the AI feature for news and entertainment headlines \u2013 an update that will eventually reach all users \u2013 and said it was working on improvements for the tool.\n\nThe feature is part of the iPhone maker\u2019s Apple Intelligence tools it launched late last year \u2013 the company\u2019s first major steps into generative AI technology, which has become the biggest trend in the industry over the last two years since the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nAccording to tech industry website MacRumors, Apple has temporarily disabled the tool for the news and entertainment categories while it works on improvements but plans to bring them back in a future software update.\n\nIn addition, its report said Apple has added a warning below the notification summaries switch in the Settings app which warns users that it is a beta feature and that \u201csummaries may contain errors\u201d.\n\nThe aim of the notification summaries tool was to group together a string of notifications from individual apps into a single, quick, bite-size alert to help users save time.\n\nHowever, a number of news organisations have raised concerns or complained directly to Apple since the tool was launched after a number of incidents where it created false headlines when attempting to summarise news stories.\n\nMany had also urged the tech giant to suspend its use of the feature, and a number of press freedom groups have also spoken out about the tool, warning that it posed a risk to people attempting to seek out reliable information.\n\nIn December, the BBC complained to Apple about the tool after it created a number of false headlines based on BBC news app alerts, including one stating that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealth (UNH) chief executive Brian Thompson, had shot himself.\n\nIn response to that complaint, Apple told the BBC earlier this month that an update to Apple Intelligence would be rolled out \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, and also noted that using the summarisation feature was optional.\n\nApple has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nView Comments",

While Apple is addressing the issue, it raises concerns about the reliability of their AI and could damage their reputation. Previous predictions are mixed, but the trend seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook. Considering this specific news and the evolving sentiment, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but not drastically so, as Apple is a large, diversified company and this is a relatively minor issue in the grand scheme of things."

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The Supreme Court's decision upholding the potential TikTok ban presents a complex scenario for Apple.  While the immediate impact could be negative due to the potential loss of TikTok from the App Store and associated revenue, the severity is mitigated by several factors. Apple's revenue is highly diversified; the loss of TikTok is unlikely to be catastrophic.  Significant uncertainty surrounds the ban's enforcement. Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement, or a sale of TikTok's US operations, could negate the negative impact.  Legal challenges add further uncertainty. The news highlights benefits to competitors like Meta, suggesting revenue redistribution rather than market contraction.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting this uncertainty.  However, the potential for significant fines if Apple does not comply with the ban is a considerable risk.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the potential for negative consequences, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term. The long-term impact is even more uncertain and depends heavily on the resolution of the TikTok situation. The consistent prediction of a slight rise in previous rounds, despite the introduction of this news, suggests that other positive factors are outweighing the negative impact of the TikTok ban in the eyes of some investors."

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

This scenario could lead to a shift in user base and advertising revenue for platforms currently competing with TikTok, such as Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). As a major player in the mobile app ecosystem, Apple (AAPL) could face a temporary limbo period if TikTok is removed from its app store. However, the long-term impact on AAPL's stock price may not be significantly negative given its diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence. Previous predictions from different models show varying probabilities of stock price movement, but generally, the majority predict a slight to moderate fall in stock price due to the uncertainty introduced by the ban."

While these developments are significant for Nvidia, the direct implications for Apple Inc. are less clear. The mention of big tech leaders attending the inauguration suggests a favorable environment for tech stocks, which could positively influence Apple's stock. However, concerns about potential tariffs and regulations under the new administration could exert downward pressure. Given the mixed signals from the news and the previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of a stock price rise, but with a notable chance of a fall due to regulatory concerns."

While Apple is addressing the issue, it could damage their reputation and investor confidence, especially given the increasing importance of AI in the tech industry. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, but the trend seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook. Therefore, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise, but not drastically so, as Apple is a large, diversified company and this is a relatively minor issue in the grand scheme of things. The previous rounds of predictions show a slight downward trend in the probability of the stock price rising, which I am taking into account."

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The TikTok ban presents a complex situation for Apple.  While the immediate impact could be negative due to the potential loss of TikTok from the App Store and associated revenue, the severity is mitigated by several factors. Apple's revenue is highly diversified; the loss of TikTok is unlikely to be catastrophic. Significant uncertainty surrounds the ban's enforcement. Trump's potential executive order delaying enforcement, or a sale of TikTok's US operations, could negate the negative impact. Legal challenges add further uncertainty. The news highlights benefits to competitors like Meta, suggesting revenue redistribution rather than market contraction.  The potential for significant fines if Apple does not comply is a considerable risk, however.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting this uncertainty.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the potential for negative consequences, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the magnitude of the impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term. The long-term impact is highly uncertain and depends heavily on the resolution of the TikTok situation.  The consistent prediction of a slight rise in previous rounds, despite the introduction of this news, suggests that other positive factors are outweighing the negative impact of the TikTok ban in the eyes of some investors.  I'm weighting the uncertainty heavily, leaning slightly towards a fall due to the potential for fines, but acknowledging the possibility of a neutral or even slightly positive outcome depending on how the situation resolves."

This disinflation has occurred without severely impacting economic growth, suggesting the success of a soft landing. The stock market has thrived in 2024, spurred by recent rate cuts (0.5% in September and 0.25% each in November and December), and a notable surge followed Donald Trump's presidential election win in November, propelling indices to historic highs. Nonetheless, the outlook for 2025 remains clouded by the pace and magnitude of future rate cuts as well as potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes once the Trump administration takes over. The path forward is marked by uncertainty.\n\nWant to invest in winners with rock-solid fundamentals? Check out our Top 6 Stocks and add them to your watchlist.

Apple's revenue was up 6.1% year over year, exceeding analysts' expectations by 0.5%. The stock is up 1.7% since the results. Considering the overall positive earnings report and the current market trend, it is likely that the stock price will continue to rise. However, the article also mentions uncertainty in the market outlook for 2025 due to potential changes in trade policy and corporate taxes, which could impact the stock price. The predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but most of them lean towards a positive outlook for Apple's stock price. Given the positive earnings report and the general trend of the market, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

If TikTok does not sell its ownership, the app's revenue and 170 million users could be consequential, with platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP) poised to gain traffic.\n\nRohit Kulkarni, Roth Capital Partners senior research analyst, joins Catalysts to speak on the uproar as well as the legal risks for Apple (AAPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) that would lead to TikTok being removed from their respective app stores.\n\n\"This is a significant event in the history of tech and cross-border tech,\" Kulkarni says. He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

This scenario could lead to a shift in user base and advertising revenue for platforms currently competing with TikTok, such as Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). As a major player in the mobile app ecosystem, Apple (AAPL) could face a temporary limbo period if TikTok is removed from its app store. However, the long-term impact on AAPL's stock price may not be significantly negative given its diversified product portfolio and strong brand presence. Previous predictions from different models show varying probabilities of stock price movement, but generally, the majority predict a slight to moderate fall in stock price due to the uncertainty introduced by the ban."

However, the negative publicity and concerns raised by news organizations and press freedom groups could create a slight negative sentiment.

The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, representing a modest 4% upside from the current price. This suggests a slightly bullish outlook among analysts, but it's not a strong indicator.  The article also points out that Apple's dividend yield is low (0.43%), which might not attract income-focused investors.  The recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but the overall tone of the article is more retrospective than predictive.  Considering the modest analyst price target and the lack of significant new information driving a substantial price change, the probabilities are weighted towards a relatively stable price, with a slightly higher chance of a small rise due to the positive earnings report and analyst sentiment."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

However, it mentions Apple's recent stock performance, noting a 4% drop due to concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the Chinese market. Given this context, the news does not provide a strong positive catalyst for Apple's stock. The mention of Apple's decline and broader market concerns suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price."

He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about the potential TikTok ban in the US and its implications for the tech industry could have indirect effects on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The main concern is that if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might create a short-term uncertainty for Apple. However, given that TikTok's revenue and user base are not directly attributed to Apple, the impact is likely to be minimal. The major beneficiaries of TikTok's potential ban are expected to be other social media platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). Apple's stock price movement is more likely to be influenced by other factors, and this news might not have a significant direct impact. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a neutral or positive outlook due to the minimal direct impact."

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The provided news article is primarily a retrospective analysis of Apple's stock performance over the past 10 years, highlighting significant returns.  While this is positive, it offers little predictive power for future price movements. The article mentions a consensus analyst price target of $245.17, suggesting a modest 4% upside. This, combined with a low dividend yield (0.43%), indicates limited appeal to growth or income-focused investors.  Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but this is already factored into the current price. The lack of significant new information, coupled with the modest analyst target and the historical nature of the main content, suggests a low probability of significant price movement in either direction. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects. Considering the overall information, a slightly higher probability of a small price increase is assigned due to the positive earnings report and analyst sentiment, but the overall probability of significant change is low."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why NYC Commuters Get New Way to Dodge Traffic: $95 Helicopter Rides Scaramucci, Ackman Donate to Whitney Tilson\u2019s NYC Mayoral Run In a City of Sprawl, Wildfire Evacuation Is Getting Harder Will Americans Ever Lose Their Taste for Telework?\n\nThe worst performer among the Magnificent Seven since hitting a record in July, Microsoft shares have stumbled under the weight of ambitious spending and signs that adoption of its AI services has been slower than hoped. The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

This is a negative development, as it highlights potential challenges in their AI development and deployment. However, the feature is in beta, Apple is addressing the issue, and the summarization feature is optional, which mitigates the negative impact. Concerns raised by news organizations and press freedom groups could create a slight negative sentiment. Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of slightly negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is low, but a slight dip is possible. Taking into account the previous rounds of predictions, I will adjust my prediction to reflect the slightly negative sentiment and the fact that the issue is being addressed."

While this is positive, it doesn't offer strong predictive power for future price movements. The analyst consensus price target of $245.17 suggests a modest 4% upside, but this is a relatively small potential gain.  The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income-focused investors. Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but this information is likely already priced into the stock.  The lack of significant new information, coupled with the modest analyst target and the historical nature of the main content, suggests a low probability of significant price movement in either direction. The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects. Considering the overall information, and the lack of any significant negative news, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a small price increase due to the positive earnings report and analyst sentiment, but the overall probability of significant change is low.  The uncertainty is reflected in the probabilities assigned."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Microsoft Corp. has plowed tens of billions of dollars into artificial intelligence. With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest.

He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META).

REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news regarding TikTok losing a Supreme Court battle and facing potential bans or forced sales in the US might have indirect effects on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The news suggests that TikTok's potential downfall could redistribute advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META) and YouTube, potentially benefiting these companies at the expense of TikTok. Since Apple operates in a different market segment, the direct impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal. However, the broader implications of shifts in digital advertising revenue and potential changes in consumer behavior could create some market uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the historical data showing relatively balanced outcomes, the estimated probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this news remains moderate."

                                    "reasoning": "The provided news article is largely retrospective, focusing on Apple's strong past performance. While this is positive sentiment, it doesn't predict future price movements.  The analyst consensus price target of $245.17 suggests a modest 4% upside, which is not a strong bullish signal. The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income investors.  Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but this is likely already priced into the stock.  The lack of significant new information, coupled with the modest analyst target and the historical nature of the main content, suggests a low probability of significant price movement in either direction.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty. Considering all this, I assign a slightly higher probability to a small price increase due to the positive earnings report and analyst sentiment, but the overall probability of significant change is low. The uncertainty is reflected in the probabilities assigned.  The consistent near 50/50 split in previous predictions across multiple models further reinforces the uncertainty and lack of a clear directional bias from this news alone."

With its stock struggling, the key question is how quickly those investments can prove to be successful.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time. The stock rose 1.9% on Friday, participating in a broad-based rally.\n\nThis reflects scrutiny on the firm\u2019s heavy AI-related spending, especially as investors seek a more pronounced payoff. Microsoft\u2019s capital expenditures this fiscal year include tens of billions of dollars on data centers.\n\nThe next read on these trends will come toward the end of the month, when the company delivers second-quarter results. The past two reports have both disappointed, with a tepid growth forecast for its Azure cloud-computing business last quarter and a slowdown in Azure in the previous one.\n\nSlower adoption would further obscure when Microsoft could see a return on its AI investment. \u201cGoogle Gemini, ChatGPT, and Meta AI are significantly more popular among consumers relative to Microsoft Copilot\u201d or other services, according to Wedbush\u2019s quarterly consumer internet survey. It noted that 13% of those surveyed indicated they used Microsoft\u2019s Copilot in the past three months, compared with 25% for Gemini.\n\nMicrosoft has twice rebranded its main chatbot for businesses, as part of an effort to persuade people to use it. Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities.

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for the tech industry. Apple's stock price movement is likely to be indirectly influenced by this news. As TikTok's revenue and user base are not directly attributed to Apple, the impact is expected to be minimal. However, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might create short-term uncertainty for Apple. The major beneficiaries of TikTok's potential ban are expected to be other social media platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). Given the minimal direct impact, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a neutral or positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions, which show a wide range of opinions and uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

However, since Apple operates in a different market segment and does not directly compete with TikTok, the direct impact on Apple's stock price might be minimal. The broader implications of shifts in digital advertising revenue and potential changes in consumer behavior could create some market uncertainty, but this is unlikely to have a significant effect on Apple specifically. Considering the mixed signals and the historical data showing relatively balanced outcomes, the estimated probability of a significant rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this news remains moderate."

While this is positive, it doesn't offer strong predictive power for future price movements. The analyst consensus price target of $245.17 suggests a modest 4% upside, which is not a strong bullish signal. The low dividend yield (0.43%) is unlikely to attract income investors. Recent Q4 2024 earnings beat expectations, which is positive, but this is likely already priced into the stock.  The lack of significant new information, coupled with the modest analyst target and the historical nature of the main content, suggests a low probability of significant price movement in either direction. The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.

The cooling hype risks leaving the stock vulnerable, given it trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n\u201cThe market is coming to a realization that AI adoption will take longer, and that expectations for near-term returns have gotten out of line,\u201d said Tim Pagliara, chief investment officer at Capwealth Advisors. While \u201cMicrosoft is really pushing AI, it has to prove the concept at a time when it also has huge capex plans and the stock is fully valued by historical standards.\u201d\n\nThe stock is more than 7% below its record high set in July and its gain since the start of 2024 has underperformed that of the Nasdaq 100 Index in that time.

Morgan Stanley analysts wrote that this \u201cmight be perceived as a reaction to tepid adoption of the existing paid Microsoft 365 Copilot offering.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn Thursday, the company announced a 30% price hike for its suite of Office apps, which come with access to AI tools.\n\nEven if the pace of AI adoption is slower than hoped for, Microsoft remains a consensus favorite on Wall Street. More than 90% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, and the average analyst price target points to upside of almost 20% over the coming 12 months, the highest return potential among the Magnificent Seven, except for Nvidia Corp.\n\nBank of America expects software will outperform this year, and named Microsoft as one of its top picks, saying it is the \u201cbest positioned\u201d for the AI cycle across infrastructure and applications.\n\nSolita Marcelli, chief investment officer Americas at UBS Global Wealth Management, also has a positive outlook.\n\n\u201cWhile AI revenues are likely to again lag behind capex in 2025, we see evidence that AI monetization is primed to improve sharply in 2025,\u201d she wrote earlier this month about big tech stocks. \u201cStrong underlying earnings per share growth should be enough to support solid near-term share price performance.\u201d\n\nRevenue at Microsoft is expected to grow about 14% this fiscal year. Earnings are also seen expanding at a double-digit pace for the next several years.\n\nThe question is whether that\u2019s enough to provide a floor under the valuation. Shares trade at more than 30 times estimated earnings, and while the multiple recently touched its lowest in more than a year, it is above its long-term average of about 25.\n\n\u201cAI adoption is the question on everyone\u2019s mind, but we still find the stock highly attractive given its growth,\u201d said Christopher Ouimet, a portfolio manager at Logan Capital Management. \u201cSome traders are focused on short-term growth trends with AI or Azure, but the long-term picture seems clear. AI adoption might not be linear, but it should end up being massive.\u201d\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. fell 4% on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the iPhone maker since August. The stock has come under pressure in 2025 amid concerns over iPhone sales and weakness in the critical Chinese market. Apple is down nearly 8% this year, compared with a gain of 1.9% for the Nasdaq 100. Apple rose 1.3% on Friday.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nTikTok is poised to win a reprieve from a law that would ban the popular social media app thanks to a holiday weekend and a pledge from President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s incoming administration to give its Chinese owner more time to divest. SpaceX\u2019s Starship rocket exploded just minutes into its seventh test flight, an unexpected setback after the Elon Musk-led company had made steady progress advancing the vehicle\u2019s capabilities. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen\u2019s computer was infiltrated and unclassified files were accessed as part of a broader breach of the agency by Chinese state-sponsored hackers, according to two people familiar with the matter. Nintendo Co. fell the most in more than three months after giving a glimpse of its next-generation Switch 2 in a two-minute video, saying that more details would come on April 2.\n\nEarnings Due Friday\n\nNo major earnings expected\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nWalgreens Replaced Fridge Doors With Smart Screens.

Considering the previous predictions and the trend of slightly negative sentiment towards Apple's stock price, the probability of a significant price drop is low, but a slight dip is possible."

He explains that the significant number of hours people spend on TikTok will likely go to companies like Instagram, YouTube, Snapchat, and \"maybe other companies like Reddit (RDDT) and Pinterest.\"\n\nIt is also unclear where TikTok's high revenue will be redirected after the ban.

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline discusses the potential ban of TikTok in the US and its implications for the tech industry. Apple's stock price movement is likely to be indirectly influenced by this news. As TikTok's revenue and user base are not directly attributed to Apple, the impact is expected to be minimal. However, if TikTok is removed from the App Store, it might create short-term uncertainty for Apple. The major beneficiaries of TikTok's potential ban are expected to be other social media platforms like Instagram (META), YouTube, and Snapchat (SNAP). Given the minimal direct impact, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this specific news are relatively balanced, with a slight inclination towards a neutral or positive outlook. Considering the previous predictions, which show a wide range of opinions and uncertainty surrounding Apple's near-term prospects, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a slightly lower probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

These challenges include difficulties in transferring staff from China and importing machinery. While this news is potentially negative, its impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be limited for several reasons. First, the news focuses on operational challenges, not a fundamental change in Apple's business model or product demand. Second, Apple likely has multiple manufacturing partners and diversification strategies in place to mitigate risks associated with any single supplier. Third, the overall market sentiment towards Apple and the broader tech sector will likely play a more significant role in determining short-term price movements than this specific news. Therefore, the probability of a significant price drop is considered low.  The probability of a price rise is also low, as the news is not inherently positive. The most likely scenario is that the news will have a minimal impact on the stock price."

Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas.

But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban.

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) has paused its artificial intelligence (AI) tool that summarises news headlines after a number of errors drew complaints from news organisations and campaigners.\n\nOn Thursday, the tech giant released a beta software update to developers which disabled the AI feature for news and entertainment headlines \u2013 an update that will eventually reach all users \u2013 and said it was working on improvements for the tool.\n\nThe feature is part of the iPhone maker\u2019s Apple Intelligence tools it launched late last year \u2013 the company\u2019s first major steps into generative AI technology, which has become the biggest trend in the industry over the last two years since the launch of OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.\n\nAccording to tech industry website MacRumors, Apple has temporarily disabled the tool for the news and entertainment categories while it works on improvements but plans to bring them back in a future software update.\n\nIn addition, its report said Apple has added a warning below the notification summaries switch in the Settings app which warns users that it is a beta feature and that \u201csummaries may contain errors\u201d.\n\nThe aim of the notification summaries tool was to group together a string of notifications from individual apps into a single, quick, bite-size alert to help users save time.\n\nHowever, a number of news organisations have raised concerns or complained directly to Apple since the tool was launched after a number of incidents where it created false headlines when attempting to summarise news stories.\n\nMany had also urged the tech giant to suspend its use of the feature, and a number of press freedom groups have also spoken out about the tool, warning that it posed a risk to people attempting to seek out reliable information.\n\nIn December, the BBC complained to Apple about the tool after it created a number of false headlines based on BBC news app alerts, including one stating that Luigi Mangione, the man accused of killing UnitedHealth (UNH) chief executive Brian Thompson, had shot himself.\n\nIn response to that complaint, Apple told the BBC earlier this month that an update to Apple Intelligence would be rolled out \u201cin the coming weeks\u201d, and also noted that using the summarisation feature was optional.\n\nApple has not responded to a request for comment.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news indicates a setback for Apple's AI initiatives due to inaccuracies in its news summarization tool. This is a negative development, as it highlights potential challenges in their AI development and deployment. However, the impact is somewhat mitigated by the fact that the feature is in beta, Apple is addressing the issue, and the summarization feature is optional. Also, the previous predictions show a trend of mixed opinions, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall. Considering the negative news but also Apple's response and the beta nature of the feature, I believe the impact will be slightly negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

While Foxconn is a significant manufacturing partner, Apple likely has diversified its manufacturing base to mitigate risks associated with a single supplier. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, especially considering the lack of detail in the premium article.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news' impact.  Given the limited information and the potential for the news to be absorbed into the broader market sentiment, I predict a slightly higher probability of no significant change than a price drop. The probability of a price rise is low, as the news is not inherently positive."

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) as one of Warren Buffett's recommended stocks to buy and hold through 2025 and beyond. Warren Buffett's endorsement is generally viewed positively in the market due to his reputation as a successful investor, which could boost investor confidence and demand for AAPL stock. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models (like deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324) assigning a higher probability to a price rise (0.65) due to Buffett's endorsement, while others (like google/gemini-2.0-flash-001) were more cautious (0.3). The lack of negative fundamental news about Apple in the current headline suggests a neutral to positive sentiment. Considering Buffett's influence and the absence of immediate negative catalysts, the probability of a price rise is moderately higher than a fall. However, the impact may be limited to short-term sentiment unless accompanied by concrete fundamental improvements."

While the article mentions Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of allowing movies to be released theatrically before reaching their streaming services, similar to Netflix's recent actions, there is no direct positive or negative news about Apple Inc. that would significantly impact its stock price based on this article. The news seems to be more relevant to IMAX and Netflix.

And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas.

While the feature is in beta and Apple is working on improvements, the negative publicity and concerns raised by news organizations could create a negative sentiment. The previous predictions show a trend of mixed opinions, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall. Considering the negative news but also Apple's response and the beta nature of the feature, I believe the impact will be slightly negative. However, the fact that Apple is addressing the issue and the feature is optional mitigates the negative impact. Taking into account the previous predictions and the nature of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

Apple likely has diversified its manufacturing base, mitigating the risk associated with any single supplier. The lack of detail in the premium article further reduces the significance of this news.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news' impact.  While some models highlight potential positive factors like Warren Buffett's endorsement (though unrelated to this specific news), the overall sentiment leans slightly towards a neutral or slightly negative outlook. The Foxconn news is not a major catalyst for a significant price movement in either direction.  Considering the limited information and the potential for the news to be absorbed into the broader market sentiment, I predict a higher probability of no significant change than a price rise or fall. The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the overall uncertainty and the lack of a strong positive or negative driver from this specific news."

Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others were more cautious. The lack of negative fundamental news about Apple in the current headline suggests a neutral to positive sentiment. Considering Buffett's influence and the absence of immediate negative catalysts, the probability of a price rise is moderately higher than a fall.

(Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas. Brandon Bell/Pool via REUTERS/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nThere are other possible buyers too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nTrump said in a post Friday on Truth Social that he had spoken with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\n\"It is my expectation that we will solve many problems together, and starting immediately.\"\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView Comments",

But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news discusses the potential ban on TikTok in the US, which could result in a redistribution of advertising dollars toward platforms like Meta and YouTube. Although this news directly impacts TikTok and its competitors rather than Apple, it could indirectly influence investor sentiment toward the broader tech sector. However, Apple operates in a different segment of the market and does not directly compete with TikTok. The overall market conditions and investor perception of Apple's fundamentals, including its strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and robust financials, may outweigh the indirect effects of this news."

While the feature is in beta and Apple is addressing the issue, the negative publicity and concerns raised by news organizations could create negative sentiment. The previous predictions show a trend of mixed opinions, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall, but the more recent rounds show a slight shift towards a more negative outlook. Considering the negative news, Apple's response, and the beta nature of the feature, the impact will likely be slightly negative. The fact that Apple is addressing the issue and the feature is optional mitigates the negative impact to some extent. Taking into account the previous predictions and the nature of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

Apple likely has diversified its manufacturing base, mitigating the risk associated with any single supplier.  The lack of detail in the premium article further reduces the significance of this news. Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news' impact.  While some models highlight potential positive factors (like Warren Buffett's endorsement, though unrelated to this specific news), the overall sentiment leans towards neutral.  The Foxconn news is not a major catalyst for a significant price movement.  Considering the limited information and the potential for the news to be absorbed into the broader market sentiment, I predict a higher probability of no significant change than a price rise or fall.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect the overall uncertainty and the lack of a strong positive or negative driver from this specific news.  The consistent near-neutral predictions across multiple rounds further support this assessment."

Warren Buffett's endorsement is generally viewed positively in the market due to his reputation as a successful investor, which could boost investor confidence and demand for AAPL stock. Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price rise due to Buffett's endorsement, while others were more cautious. The lack of negative fundamental news about Apple in the current headline suggests a neutral to positive sentiment. Considering Buffett's influence and the absence of immediate negative catalysts, the probability of a price rise is moderately higher than a fall.

Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and the Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility when arguing his case before the Supreme Court, which on Friday upheld a US law that bans the app on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer told the court on Jan. 10.The fate of TikTok is now up in the air following a Supreme Court decision to uphold a US ban on Jan. 19 unless the app is sold. (Photo by Anna Barclay/Getty Images)\u00b7Anna Barclay via Getty Images\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law \u2014 a law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court Friday.\n\nWhat the law signed by President Joe Biden actually states is that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nIn that scenario the app won\u2019t \"magically disappear\" from phones, CNET tech reporter Abrar Al-Heeti told Yahoo Finance, but experts said its performance could weaken over time because TikTok\u2019s parent won\u2019t be able to make app store updates.\n\n\u201cThe practical effect is, in the short run, what's going to happen is new users won't be able to download the app in any of the marketplaces,\u201d said Pepperdine University media and intellectual property law professor Victoria Schwartz.The law upheld by the Supreme Court requires Apple to take the TikTok app off its app store if TikTok is not divested. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\n\"But I think more significantly, they won't be able to push any updates,\" she said. And that becomes more and more problematic, especially as new operating systems are released.\n\n\"Now, all of a sudden, TikTok is essentially what we call an orphan program. It's super vulnerable to data breaches, to cyber hacking.\"\n\nTikTok's millions of users, especially small business owners, are worried about whether they'll be able to continue to create content on the platform or save their content if the app is shuttered, Schwartz added.\n\n\"In terms of content, under TikTok's licensing agreements, the intellectual property belongs to its content creators,\" Schwartz said.\n\nAccount holders who want to keep their content, she said, should have a plan in place to back it all up. \"It doesn't do any good if you own intellectual property rights and it's stored only somewhere in the TikTok universe.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nIf TikTok does in fact go dark on Jan. 19, it plans to give users an option to download all their data so that they can take a record of their personal information, according to Reuters.\n\nIt could also later restore service for US users if the ban is ever reversed.\n\nWhat Trump could do\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN on Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months.\n\nThe order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for the tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.Last November Elon Musk speaks with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at a viewing of the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket in Brownsville, Texas.

Given the indirect impact on Apple and the uncertainty surrounding the ban, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced.

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week. But Apple and Google still have to weigh whether that\u2019s a risk they want to take.\n\nThere are less risky paths for Trump to take. He could push Congress to overturn the law or to encourage lawmakers to pass a law extending the Jan. 19 deadline. This week, Sen. Ed Markey did introduce a bill that would extend the deadline by 270 days, according to a statement.\n\nHe could also help find a buyer for the US operations, or even a piece of it, which would allow TikTok to avoid the ban. Chinese government officials, according to reports by Bloomberg and the Wall Street Journal, have discussed selling the US business to Elon Musk, the owner of X.U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and Elon Musk watch the launch of the sixth test flight of the SpaceX Starship rocket last November in Brownsville, Texas. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)\u00b7Brandon Bell via Getty Images\n\nThe officials would prefer to keep TikTok under ByteDance ownership, according to the media reports, but have discussed the sale to Musk as among their contingency plans.\n\nAntitrust experts predict that Musk could clear US legal hurdles imposed by a TikTok acquisition, which some estimate could amount to $40 billion-$50 billion. One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too. Investor and \u201cShark Tank\u201d star Kevin O\u2019Leary told Yahoo Finance last week that he and a consortium of business professionals led by billionaire Frank McCourt Jr. are willing to pay up to $20 billion for TikTok, calling it a \"legacy opportunity.\u201d\n\nMcCourt, the founder of internet advocacy group Project Liberty and former owner of the LA Dodgers, also recently expressed optimism about a potential deal on Yahoo Finance\u2019s Opening Bid podcast.\n\n\u201cThere's a deal to be made here so that US TikTok can stay in business,\" McCourt said. \"We want to see the platform stay in business and the 170 million [US users] enjoy it.\"\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

Although this news directly impacts TikTok and its competitors rather than Apple, it could indirectly influence investor sentiment toward the broader tech sector. However, Apple operates in a different segment of the market and does not directly compete with TikTok. The overall market conditions and investor perception of Apple's fundamentals, including its strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and robust financials, may outweigh the indirect effects of this news."

The previous predictions show a trend of mixed opinions, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall, but the more recent rounds show a slight shift towards a more negative outlook. Considering the negative news, Apple's response, and the beta nature of the feature, the impact will likely be slightly negative. The fact that Apple is addressing the issue and the feature is optional mitigates the negative impact to some extent. Taking into account the previous predictions and the nature of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising. However, the impact is likely to be limited as the feature is not core to Apple's business."

The lack of detail in the premium article further reduces the significance of this news.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the news' impact.  While some models highlight potential positive factors (like Warren Buffett's endorsement, though unrelated to this specific news), the overall sentiment leans towards neutral. The Foxconn news is not a major catalyst for a significant price movement in either direction.  Considering the limited information and the potential for the news to be absorbed into the broader market sentiment, I predict a higher probability of no significant change than a price rise or fall.  The consistent near-neutral predictions across multiple rounds further support this assessment.  However, the slight negative bias in some predictions regarding other news (AI inaccuracies, potential TikTok ban) suggests a slightly higher probability of a price fall than a price rise, though the magnitude is likely to be small."

The ban would prevent Apple from allowing users to download TikTok from its app store, but it would not necessarily remove the app from existing users' phones. President-elect Donald Trump is considering ways to save TikTok, which adds uncertainty to the situation. Given the indirect impact on Apple and the uncertainty surrounding the ban, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced. However, considering the potential loss of app store revenue and the overall market sentiment, the probability of a slight decrease in Apple's stock price might be slightly higher than a significant increase."

                                    "content": "The Supreme Court upheld a US law that bans TikTok on Jan. 19 unless it is sold to an owner not controlled by a foreign adversary, a ruling that creates new uncertainty for a social-media app used by 170 million Americans.\n\nThe court sided with the US government\u2019s argument that ties between TikTok\u2019s parent ByteDance and the Chinese government presented a national security threat that empowered Congress to demand it be sold.\n\n\"There is no doubt that, for more than 170 million Americans, TikTok offers a distinctive and expansive outlet for expression, means of engagement, and source of community,\" the court said.\n\n\"But Congress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikTok\u2019s data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary.\"\n\nTikTok had argued that it was entitled to First Amendment speech protections, but the court concluded the law did not violate those constitutional rights for TikTok or its users.TikTok users outside the Supreme Court on Jan. 10. (AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)\u00b7ASSOCIATED PRESS\n\nFriday's decision likely leaves the fate of TikTok in the hands of President-elect Donald Trump, who promised to \"save TikTok\" and had asked the nation's highest court to suspend the divest-or-be-banned deadline. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.\n\n\"It ultimately goes up to me, so you're going to see what I'm going to do,\" Trump said in an interview with CNN Friday. \"Congress has given me the decision, so I'll be making the decision.\"\n\nTrump is reportedly mulling unconventional ways to save TikTok from an impending US ban, including an executive order that would push out enforcement of the new law by months. He said in a post today on Truth Social that spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about TikTok and other topics.\n\nThe executive order being considered by Trump, as reported first by the Washington Post and confirmed by other media outlets, would suspend enforcement of the TikTok law for 60 to 90 days.\n\nBut doing so could mean contravening federal law, heightening the danger that such a rescue could face serious legal hurdles.\n\nThe outcome of this blockbuster case will have dramatic implications for one of China\u2019s most valuable technology companies, millions of American smartphone users, and some of the biggest social media companies in the US.\n\nThe court\u2019s decision to uphold the ban could be a long-term boon for TikTok's social media rivals by redistributing advertising dollars to platforms like Meta (META). In particular, Instagram could see a sizable uptick in advertiser dollars if TikTok bites the dust.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg could benefit from a TikTok ban. REUTERS/Manuel Orbegozo\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\n\"In general, it\u2019s a good thing for Meta,\u201d William Blair research analyst Ralph Schackart told Yahoo Finance. \u201cWe estimate in a note potentially 60% to 70% of TikTok spend could move to Instagram and it monetizes at around 3x the rate of TikTok.\"\n\nYouTube and its Shorts platform should also gain from TikTok\u2019s loss. According to Morgan Stanley managing director Brian Nowak, every 10% of the time users would have spent on TikTok that goes to YouTube would add $400 million to $750 million in ad revenue to the video platform\u2019s sales.\n\nWhat happens next\n\nWhat happens on your smartphone now that this US law banning TikTok is set to take effect on Jan. 19? It may depend on what TikTok parent ByteDance decides to do.\n\nIt could voluntarily shut down use of the app for U.S. users. Anyone trying to open the app would see a message sending them to a website offering an explanation about the ban, according to reports by Reuters and The Information.\n\nTikTok\u2019s lawyer hinted at this possibility last week when arguing his case before the Supreme Court.\n\nOn Jan. 19 \"at least as I understand it, we go dark. Essentially, the platform shuts down,\" TikTok's lawyer said.The TikTok app logo. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration/File Photo\u00b7Reuters / Reuters\n\nBut this is not necessarily what is required by law. A law upheld by the nation\u2019s highest court, which only triggers a ban on Jan. 19 if the app has not been divested, enforces its ban in a different way.\n\nThe law states that it will no longer be legal for companies like Apple (APPL) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to allow users to download TikTok from their app stores, nor can cloud-storage companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), and Oracle (ORCL) host the app.\n\nPenalties for violations range up to $5,000 for each access provided to a US user.\n\nAny executive order from Trump delaying enforcement of the law would create a new legal dilemma for these tech giants that are required by law to put the TikTok ban into effect.\n\nTrump could ask his attorney general not to enforce the law \u2014 his nominee Pam Bondi didn\u2019t commit to enforcing it when questioned by lawmakers this week.

One reason is TikTok and X have distinct users.\n\nThere are other possible buyers, too.

Although this news directly impacts TikTok and its competitors rather than Apple, it could indirectly influence investor sentiment toward the broader tech sector. However, Apple operates in a different segment of the market and does not directly compete with TikTok. The overall market conditions and investor perception of Apple's fundamentals, including its strong brand, diverse product portfolio, and robust financials, may outweigh the indirect effects of this news. The previous predictions show a trend of mixed opinions, but the general consensus leans slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook due to Apple's strong position and diversified business model."

While this information is positive and showcases Apple's long-term growth potential, it doesn't directly impact the immediate short-term stock price. The article also mentions upcoming earnings with expected growth in EPS and revenue, which is a positive indicator. However, it also notes that the stock may not be attractive to growth or income-focused investors due to a modest dividend yield and limited upside potential based on analyst price targets. Considering these factors, the positive historical performance and expected earnings growth are somewhat offset by the limited short-term upside and modest dividend yield. Therefore, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users.

Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones.

Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise.

Any price movement would likely be due to broader market factors or other news unrelated to this announcement.  The probability of a price rise or fall is therefore close to random chance."

The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones.

Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise.

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its enhanced Apple Pay integration, offering a 'Pay Later' option. This is positive for SYF, but the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely minimal.  The announcement doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or operations.  Therefore, the probability of this news significantly influencing Apple's stock price is low. Any price movement would probably be due to broader market trends or other unrelated news.  Considering the previous predictions which range widely and often focus on unrelated news, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change due to the lack of direct relevance."

The company's performance in China is a significant contributor to its overall revenue, and a decline in sales in this region may lead to a decrease in investor confidence. Considering the previous predictions, most models agree that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising, with some models estimating a higher probability of a fall due to the significant decline in sales and loss of market share.

However, it also notes that the stock may not be attractive to growth or income-focused investors due to a modest dividend yield and limited upside potential. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on negative aspects like supply chain issues or sales decline in China (though these are from different news articles), while others emphasized the positive historical performance and earnings expectations. The current article is primarily positive, focusing on past returns and expected earnings growth. Given this, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article also points out limitations in growth potential and dividend yield.

The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its enhanced Apple Pay integration, offering a 'Pay Later' option. This is positive for SYF, but the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely minimal. The announcement doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or operations.  Therefore, the probability of this news significantly influencing Apple's stock price is low. Any price movement would probably be due to broader market trends or other unrelated news.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the lack of direct impact of this news on AAPL.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the wide range of previous predictions, I'm assigning a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change due to the lack of direct relevance.  The probabilities are adjusted slightly to reflect the overall market sentiment and the possibility of minor indirect effects."

However, the article notes that the stock may not be attractive to growth or income-focused investors due to a modest dividend yield and limited upside potential. Considering the mixed signals from historical performance and future expectations, along with the previous predictions showing a trend towards higher probability of falling due to concerns like supply chain issues and sales decline in China, the stock is more likely to experience downward pressure.

Historically, Warren Buffett's endorsements have positively influenced stock prices due to his reputation and track record. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's future performance or any direct impact on its operations. Considering the positive implication of being a Warren Buffett-recommended stock and assuming no other negative news, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. But given that the news does not provide direct actionable information about Apple's future performance, the impact is likely moderate. Weighing this against previous predictions that often cited negative factors such as supply chain issues and declining sales in China, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall."

                                    "reasoning": "The provided news article primarily focuses on Apple's historical performance, showcasing the significant returns an investor would have realized over the past 10 years. It also mentions upcoming Q1 2025 earnings with expected growth in EPS and revenue, which are positive indicators. Analysts have a 'Buy' rating with a price target implying a 4% upside. However, it also notes that the stock may not be attractive to growth or income-focused investors due to a modest dividend yield and limited upside potential. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on negative aspects like supply chain issues or sales decline in China (though these are from different news articles), while others emphasized the positive historical performance and earnings expectations. The current article is primarily positive, focusing on past returns and expected earnings growth. Given this, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article also points out limitations in growth potential and dividend yield. The previous rounds' negative predictions, while based on different news, suggest some underlying concerns that temper the optimism. However, the fact that the current news is about historical performance and upcoming earnings, which are both positive, gives a slight edge to the probability of a rise."

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its enhanced Apple Pay integration, which is positive for SYF but has minimal direct impact on Apple (AAPL).  The announcement doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or operations.  Therefore, the likelihood of this news significantly affecting Apple's stock price is low.  Any price movement would likely be due to broader market factors or other news. Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, often based on unrelated news about Apple's sales or supply chain.  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the mixed previous predictions, I assign a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change.  The slight lean towards no change reflects the overall uncertainty and the lack of a strong positive or negative driver from this specific news."

If you had invested $10,000, you could have bought roughly 364 shares. Currently, shares trade at $234.40, meaning your investment's value could have grown to $85,392 from stock price appreciation alone.

Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281. This is how much you could have made if you had invested $10,000 in Apple stock 10 years ago. This means a total return of 822.81%.

Historically, Warren Buffett's endorsements have positively influenced stock prices due to his reputation and track record. However, the news does not provide specific details about Apple's future performance or any direct impact on its operations. Considering the positive implication of being a Warren Buffett-recommended stock and assuming no other negative news, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling. But given that the news does not provide direct actionable information about Apple's future performance, the impact is likely moderate. Weighing this against previous predictions that often cited negative factors such as supply chain issues and declining sales in China, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise compared to a fall."

Over the last 10 years, it has paid about $18.91 in dividends per share, which means you could have made $6,889 from dividends alone.\n\nSumming up $85,392 and $6,889, we end up with the final value of your investment, which is $92,281.

                                    "reasoning": "The provided news headline focuses on Apple's historical performance, specifically the returns an investor would have realized over the past 10 years. While this is positive and showcases Apple's long-term growth potential, it doesn't directly impact the immediate short-term stock price. The article also mentions upcoming Q1 2025 earnings with expected growth in EPS and revenue, which is a positive indicator. However, it also notes that the stock may not be attractive to growth or income-focused investors due to a modest dividend yield and limited upside potential based on analyst price targets. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on negative aspects like supply chain issues or sales decline in China (though these are from different news articles), while others emphasized the positive historical performance and earnings expectations. The current article is primarily positive, focusing on past returns and expected earnings growth. Given this, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the article also points out limitations in growth potential and dividend yield. The previous rounds' negative predictions, while based on different news, suggest some underlying concerns that temper the optimism. However, the fact that the current news is about historical performance and upcoming earnings, which are both positive, gives a slight edge to the probability of a rise. I am also considering the trend of previous predictions, which seem to be converging towards a more neutral stance."

                                    "content": "Synchrony Financial SYF recently made the Pay Later feature of Apple Pay available to eligible Synchrony Preferred Mastercard, Synchrony Plus World Mastercard or Synchrony Premier World Mastercard holders. The specified cardholders now have the flexibility to either utilize their credit card's standard terms or take advantage of a promotional offer featuring fixed monthly payments at checkout.\n\nTo utilize a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, cardholders must first add their card to Apple Wallet. When making purchases online or in app, using Apple Pay on an iPhone or iPad, customers can select their Synchrony Mastercard. If eligible, they can select the Pay Later option to view available promotional offers. They can then choose their preferred option and complete the fast and convenient checkout process with Apple Pay.\n\nApple Pay offers a secure, private and convenient payment experience for its users. When using a Synchrony Mastercard with Apple Pay, transaction details remain confidential, as Apple does not store any information associated with the user's purchases.\n\nSynchrony plans to extend the option to pay for eligible purchases using fixed monthly payments to a broader range of Apple Pay users within its portfolio of co-branded cards. Later this year, customers will also gain the ability to view and redeem rewards from eligible Synchrony-issued cards while checking out online or in app on iPhone and iPad with Apple Pay.\n\nTherefore, the ulterior motive of Synchrony behind the recent announcement remains to offer a greater level of choice and flexibility to its customers at the time of checkout. The availability of a suitable financing solution that removes the need to make lumpsum payments and does not exert pressure on one\u2019s finances may boost the purchasing power of consumers.\n\nBenefits of the Recent Move to Synchrony\n\nThe facility of providing simplified digital transactions and addressing the diversified credit needs of customers is expected to attract newer customers to Synchrony as well as retain existing ones. Increased utilization of Synchrony\u2019s credit cards may bring growth in interest and fees on loans, from which SYF mainly earns its revenues. Interest and fees on loans advanced 10.5% year over year in the first nine months of 2024.\n\nThe well-earned reputation of SYF can be attributed to its digital and analytics expertise. A series of acquisitions and partnerships, coupled with tech investments, have strengthened the company\u2019s digital arm. This, in turn, has fetched several program agreements with some of the nation\u2019s leading retailers and manufacturers.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSYF\u2019s Share Price Performance & Zacks Rank\n\nShares of Synchrony have gained 89.6% in the past year compared with the industry\u2019s 24.5% growth.

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on Synchrony Financial (SYF) and its enhanced Apple Pay integration, offering a 'Pay Later' option. This is positive for SYF, but the impact on Apple (AAPL) is indirect and likely minimal. The announcement doesn't directly affect Apple's financials or operations. Therefore, the likelihood of this news significantly affecting Apple's stock price is low. Any price movement would likely be due to broader market factors or other news.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the lack of direct impact of this news on AAPL.  Many previous predictions focused on unrelated negative news (supply chain issues, declining sales in China).  Considering the lack of direct relevance and the mixed previous predictions, I assign a near-neutral probability, slightly favoring no change due to the lack of direct relevance.  The slight lean towards no change reflects the overall uncertainty and the lack of a strong positive or negative driver from this specific news. I've adjusted the probabilities slightly to reflect the overall market sentiment and the possibility of minor indirect effects, but the impact is likely to be small."
