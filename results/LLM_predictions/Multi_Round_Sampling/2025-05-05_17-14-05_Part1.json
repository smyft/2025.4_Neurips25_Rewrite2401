However, the mention of a 'limited rollout' implies that this growth may not be sustained or widespread, potentially dampening enthusiasm. Overall, while there is a positive outlook on sales due to AI, the limitations could cause some hesitancy among investors.

                                    "content": "Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While the overall sales outlook is positive and exceeded expectations, driven by iPhone demand momentum, iPhone sales actually fell short of estimates, particularly in China. The growth in the services unit is a positive sign. The impact of Apple Intelligence is noted as beneficial but not yet fully realized due to limited availability. Analysts describe the results as 'mixed', with China concerns overshadowing positive areas. The initial pre-market reaction was a dip, followed by a rebound, suggesting investor uncertainty. Also a detail not to ignore, market turmoil affected other big tech companies, but Apple was relatively insulated. Overall, the positive outlook and Apple Intelligence are the main drivers for potential upside, while weak iPhone sales and China performance are the main downside risks, the market gives more importance to the overall sales outlook. Considering these factors, i think investors will focus more on the positive outlook than on some negative details that are affecting it."

While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive AI-related capital expenditure as a positive, potentially making it less vulnerable to the negative impacts affecting other Big Tech companies like Nvidia, he maintains a 'Hold' rating. This 'Hold' rating suggests a lack of strong conviction regarding near-term upward price movement.  The analyst also expresses concern regarding the mismatch between hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  These negative factors counterbalance the positive aspect of Apple's less risky CapEx strategy. Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a neutral outlook, with a marginally higher probability of the price remaining stable or experiencing minor fluctuations rather than a significant upward or downward movement based on this news alone."

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Apple's integration of AI in its devices, with a focus on personal privacy. The company has launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, which processes data on-device to ensure user privacy. The article also mentions Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, with a 6% increase from the previous year. However, the introduction of AI features in the iPhone 16 series did not result in a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI. Despite this, the article suggests that AI is expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion, with Apple being one of the key players in the AI industry. Based on this analysis, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling, due to the long-term potential of AI and Apple's position in the industry."

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

However, iPhone sales fell short of estimates, and sales in Greater China were significantly down, indicating strong competitive pressures. The positive impact of Apple Intelligence is recognized, but its limited availability tempers enthusiasm. Analysts describe the results as 'mixed.' Previous predictions have been predominantly positive, suggesting that the overall positive outlook is more compelling to investors. Taking these factors into consideration, a rise is the most likely outcome, though the negatives will mitigate that rise."

While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive AI-related capital expenditure as a positive, potentially making it less vulnerable to the negative impacts affecting other Big Tech companies, he maintains a 'Hold' rating. This indicates a lack of strong conviction for a significant price movement in either direction.  Uncertainty remains about the impact of AI on iPhone sales and the timing of hardware and software rollouts. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight leaning towards a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment. Considering the analyst's cautious outlook and the mixed nature of the news,  I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability to both upward and downward movement, leaning slightly towards a rise due to the overall positive sentiment in prior predictions, but acknowledging significant uncertainty."

The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Although the introduction of AI features in the iPhone 16 series did not result in a significant sales boost, the long-term potential of AI and Apple's position in the industry are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. Considering the positive outlook on AI's influence across industries, the growing demand for AI-driven data centers, and Apple's efforts to maintain market leadership through AI integration, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than the probability of it falling."

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available.

Previous model predictions leaned toward a price rise, suggesting an overall positive market sentiment towards Apple despite some challenges. Considering the positive guidance, the positive pre-market reaction, and the overall sentiment tilting favorably despite some negatives, the probability of a rise is cautiously estimated to be slightly higher.

Uncertainty remains about the impact of AI on iPhone sales and the timing of hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are mostly positive, ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 probability of a price rise, mainly due to strong overall financial performance and positive market sentiment. However, concerns about China market performance and the limited impact of AI integration so far are weighing on the overall outlook. Considering the analyst's cautious outlook and the mixed nature of the news, and the overall trend of previous predictions leaning optimistic, I'm assigning a probability slightly higher than 0.5 for a price rise, reflecting the overall positive market sentiment but acknowledging significant uncertainty.  The previous round's models generally moved towards slightly higher probabilities of a price rise after considering initial results. I have adjusted accordingly by decreasing the probability of a price rise compared to the majority of the earlier predictions while still acknowledging the net positive sentiment. "

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

(AAPL) Q1 2025 earnings call highlights record revenue and EPS, with positive trends in iPhone, Services, and other segments. Despite challenges in Greater China and Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decline, the overall performance was strong. The introduction of Apple Intelligence has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available. Most predictions from previous rounds suggest a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, citing the positive outlook, record revenues, and EPS. However, concerns about competitive pressures in China and foreign exchange headwinds may temper the rise. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?",
                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While this is generally positive, the article also highlights several potentially negative factors.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections for the next two years, citing macroeconomic challenges and slower-than-expected adoption of Apple intelligence features, suggests a potential negative impact on Apple's short-term performance.  Conversely, the fact that Buffett is a long-term holder of Apple, despite his generally more cautious investment approach in 2024, could point to continued confidence in Apple\u2019s long-term prospects. The article's focus is on comparing Apple's performance against other holdings and highlighting AI stocks as potentially better performers, implying a neutral to slightly bearish sentiment towards Apple in the short term.  Overall, the news is mixed and doesn't provide strong directional signals.  While the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong, short-term concerns warrant a more cautious assessment."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co.

The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement, indicating initial investor optimism. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain. The forecast of low- to mid-single-digit growth seems to have soothed investor nerves, but the overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic."

The article attempts to downplay the concerns but the initial market reaction is likely to be cautious. Considering previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions. Some models focused on Apple's positive forecasts and past performance while others highlighted the AI threat and competitive pressures. Round 0 predictions reveal that initially, some models leaned towards a stock price increase based on revenue forecasts, while others predicted a decrease due to AI concerns. Given the news is specifically about AI competition and potential vulnerabilities, it's likely to create uncertainty and exert downward pressure. The 'cheaper AI' narrative might lead investors to reassess valuations, especially considering Apple's premium pricing strategy. I am assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling because the AI competition is a fresh concern that the market hasn't fully priced in yet."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article focuses on Apple's inclusion in Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks, which is generally positive. However, the article also presents conflicting information.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features suggest potential short-term negative impacts.  Conversely, Buffett's continued long-term investment in Apple despite his cautious stance in 2024 suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects.  The overall sentiment is mixed, with several factors arguing for both price increases and decreases.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others predicting a fall. Given this uncertainty and the mixed signals in the news, a neutral probability is assigned, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the weight of Buffett's continued investment.  The lack of strong directional signals from this particular news item weighs heavily in a neutral probability assessment."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

This cancellation may raise concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings. While the Vision Pro remains a technical marvel and Apple continues to work on other concepts like AR-enabled AirPods, the negative sentiment from the project cancellation is likely to outweigh the positive aspects in the short term.

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries.

Considering the previous predictions, opinions are divided, with some models focusing on Apple's positive revenue forecasts and strong past performance, increasing its stock price while others emphasize the AI threat, AR/VR project cancellation and associated risks. The trend seems to be a slight decrease in the probability of the stock rising as the potential negative impact of the AI competition gains more weight. Given this uncertainty, and acknowledging that the market may not have fully priced in the potential competitive threat from DeepSeek's AI, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling.

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, the article also presents conflicting information.  BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features suggest potential short-term negative impacts on the stock price.  Conversely, Buffett's continued long-term investment suggests confidence in Apple's long-term prospects. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, suggesting uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news.  While the long-term outlook for Apple remains strong due to Buffett's continued investment, the short-term outlook is more uncertain due to the conflicting information presented in the article and the differing views of various prediction models. I am leaning slightly towards a higher probability of price increase due to the weight given to Buffett's long term investment and the company's consistent revenue growth. However, the risk factors should not be overlooked."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback for its innovation pipeline, particularly in the AR/VR space where competitors like Meta are making strides. This cancellation may raise concerns about Apple's ability to diversify its product portfolio and sustain growth beyond its existing offerings. While the Vision Pro remains a technical marvel and Apple continues to work on other concepts like AR-enabled AirPods, the negative sentiment from the project cancellation is likely to outweigh the positive aspects in the short term. Additionally, the article mentions internal morale issues within the Vision Products Group and past failures like the self-driving car project, which could further dampen investor confidence. Given these factors, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising."

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter.

Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While the fact that Apple is among Warren Buffett's longest-held stocks is positive, suggesting long-term confidence, several counterpoints exist. BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections and concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features point to potential short-term headwinds.  The previous predictions show significant divergence, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance. Some models emphasize the positive revenue forecast and Buffett's continued investment, while others highlight concerns about AI competition and the canceled AR glasses project.  Considering the mixed signals, the relatively neutral sentiment from the news itself (it's primarily about Buffett's portfolio and Apple's place within it, not a major new development), and the range of previous predictions, I am assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the long-term positive signal of Buffett's holdings. However, the short-term risks are substantial enough to warrant a significant probability of a price fall."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the fact that Warren Buffett is a long-term investor is positive, suggesting confidence in Apple's long-term prospects, several factors could negatively impact the short-term stock price.  These include BofA's lowered iPhone sales projections, concerns about the adoption of Apple's AI features, and the overall cautious investment approach being taken by Buffett, suggesting he's slightly less optimistic about the market overall.  The previous predictions show a significant divergence, which underscores the uncertainty surrounding the stock's near-term trajectory.  Some models highlight the positive revenue forecast and Buffett's investment, while others emphasize concerns about AI competition, the canceled AR glasses project, and potential regulatory issues.  Given the conflicting information and lack of a major new development in the news itself (mainly focusing on Buffett's portfolio), I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise due to the long-term signal from Buffett's continued investment. However, the various counterpoints and previous predictions' divergence necessitate a significant probability of price fall.  Considering the mixed signals, the overall cautious sentiment, and a significant decrease in predictions for the stock rising over multiple rounds, a slightly pessimistic outlook is adopted. "

                                    "headline": "Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses",
                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Despite declines in iPhone sales and a significant drop in China revenue, the company's services division showed growth, and other product lines like Mac and iPad performed better than expected. The stock price rose more than 3% in late trading after the announcement, indicating initial investor optimism. However, concerns about Apple's performance in China, competition in AI, and potential regulatory issues remain.

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst specifically points to a slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps as significant concerns. This negative analyst opinion strongly suggests a potential downward pressure on the stock price. However, the article also highlights that Apple is still considered a strong AI stock by some, holding a significant number of hedge fund positions.  The overall picture is nuanced, with both bearish (downgrade, concerns about AI innovation) and bullish (high hedge fund holdings, general ranking among AI stocks) factors at play.  The negativity from the analyst report is given more weight due to the specifics of their reasons and the downgrade itself.  Therefore, a higher probability is assigned to a price fall, although the probability does not reach a high value due to countervailing factors like the continued presence of hedge fund investment and continued perceived value as an AI stock."

That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role?

By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains.

Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Additionally, the high concentration of assets in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF and the elevated valuations of key competitors like Nvidia and Microsoft pose significant risk. While there are strong fundamentals in terms of revenue growth and a positive long-term AI outlook, the near-term challenges and potential perception of Apple as a follower rather than a leader in innovation weigh heavily on the sentiment.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While the headline highlights concerns about Apple's AI innovation lagging behind competitors, the article itself contains contradictory information.  An Oppenheimer analyst downgrade citing weak iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and Chinese market challenges points towards a potential price fall. This negative outlook is reinforced by several previous model predictions. However, the article also mentions Apple's high ranking among AI stocks, a large number of hedge fund holders, and the ongoing rollout of Apple Intelligence.  The conflicting information makes a definitive prediction difficult. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight bias towards a price fall. Considering the analyst downgrade as a significant negative factor and the overall mixed signals, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the possibility of a rise due to the countervailing factors. This prediction balances the bearish and bullish signals, leaning towards the negative sentiment presented by the Oppenheimer downgrade and corroborated by several previous models."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money.

One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  While the headline highlights concerns about Apple's lagging AI innovation and an Oppenheimer analyst downgrade cites weak iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and Chinese market challenges, suggesting a potential price fall, there are countervailing factors.  Apple maintains strong financial performance with record revenue and EPS, and it holds a significant position in the AI sector with substantial hedge fund holdings.  The previous predictions are also quite varied, with probabilities ranging widely.  However, the negative analyst report and consistently lower predictions in subsequent rounds that focus on the AI shortfalls carry significant weight. The strong financial results are positive, but the concerns about AI competitiveness are more impactful given that this is stated as the focus of the news article. Hence, the probability leans slightly towards a price fall, but not drastically so, acknowledging the positive financial news and hedge fund investment."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, there are some concerns highlighted, like a decline in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. The overall positive sentiment outweighs the negatives, suggesting investors might respond favorably. The mix of positive and negative indicators results in a relatively high probability of stock price rising, supported by other analysts' predictions."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline \"Sector Update: Tech Stocks Mixed in Late Afternoon\" provides limited information, making a definitive prediction difficult. The key is to look at the trend of others' predictions in the previous rounds. Initially, there was a strong divergence of beliefs among models, with some emphasizing positive financial results while others focused on concerns about Apple's AI strategy and analyst downgrades. Over the rounds, the probability of the stock price falling has generally increased, indicating a growing consensus that the negative factors outweigh the positives. Although record results have played a part in past predictions, the negative predictions around AI integration seem to have the most effect. Given this trend and the overall mixed sector performance indicated in the news, which usually implies more negative than positive, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price falling. In addition, the inability to analyze the more detailed information from the premium article pushes me towards a neutral or very slightly negative outlook."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, concerns exist regarding slower iPhone growth, a lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, challenges in the Chinese market, and a cautious approach to rolling out Apple Intelligence.  The Oppenheimer downgrade is particularly significant, reflecting analyst concerns about these issues.  While the strong financial results are positive, the AI innovation concerns and negative analyst sentiment weigh heavily. Previous model predictions show a range of probabilities, but a trend toward a slightly higher probability of a price fall emerges over the three rounds.  Considering the conflicting signals, but giving more weight to the negative analyst report and persistent concerns about AI competitiveness, I predict a higher probability of a price fall than a price rise."

The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

For the full year 2024, it reported revenue of $53.1bn, down 2% year-on-year.\n\nTraders seemed unfazed by Q1 forecasts, which put revenue between $11.7bn and $12.7bn, below the analyst consensus of $12.9bn.\n\n\u2022USD\n\n(INTC)\n\nFollow  View Quote Details\n\nNovartis (NVS)\n\nDrugsmaker Novartis (NVS) headed higher in premarket trade on Friday, after posting quarterly adjusted net income well above analyst estimates.

The company plans to sell its electronic connectors unit and said it would demerge or offload the detection operation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a new argument that Smiths Group (SMIN.L) should break up as its units would attract higher valuations as individual entities, and the company has demerged businesses in the past,\" Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n\u201cHowever, Smiths Group (SMIN.L) has historically resisted calls for a full dismantling of its conglomerate structure.

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The consensus among previous predictions leans slightly towards a price decline due to the elevated emphasis on negative aspects, such as AI competitiveness and analyst downgrades, outweighing the positive financial results.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, significant concerns exist regarding slower iPhone growth, a lack of AI innovation compared to competitors (a key focus of the article), challenges in the Chinese market, and a cautious approach to rolling out AI features.  An Oppenheimer analyst downgrade further emphasizes these concerns.  The previous model predictions show a range of probabilities, but a trend towards a higher probability of a price fall emerges across the rounds. While the strong financial results are positive, the AI innovation concerns, the negative analyst sentiment, and the consistent negative lean across multiple models carry significant weight.  Therefore, I am assigning a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the positive financial news but prioritizing the negative signals related to AI competitiveness and market perception in the short term.  The lack of conclusive evidence from the premium content is also considered as a contributing factor to the slightly negative outcome."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Revenue: $124.3 billion, up 4% year over year, an all-time record. EPS: $2.40, up 10% year over year, an all-time record. iPhone Revenue: $69.1 billion, reaching all-time records in several markets. Mac Revenue: $9 billion, up 16% year over year. iPad Revenue: $8.1 billion, up 15% year over year. Wearables, Home, and Accessories Revenue: $11.7 billion, down 2% year over year.

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news highlights multiple positive factors such as record revenue and earnings per share (EPS), increased sales in emerging markets, and record services revenue. Despite these positives, concerns remain about declines in Greater China revenue and increased operating expenses. However, the overall positive sentiment from record-breaking achievements and a generally optimistic outlook for future growth, along with the positive premarket reaction, outweighs the negatives. The mix of positive and negative indicators suggests that the stock price has a strong likelihood of rising."

                                    "headline": "Mag 7 Earnings &amp; DeepSeek: What Should Investors Know?",
                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news highlights mixed sentiments regarding Apple's performance in comparison to other tech giants in the Mag 7, particularly focusing on challenges in the Chinese market and increased competition. While Apple reported positive earnings growth of 7.1% with improving margins, concerns about demand in China and AI capabilities weigh on investor sentiment. Overall, the earnings season has shown a generally positive trend for tech stocks, yet market skepticism remains around heavy investments in AI without clear monetization strategies. Given these factors, it's likely that the stock price has a moderate chance of rising due to earnings beats, but also a significant chance of falling due to ongoing competitive pressures and market uncertainties."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article primarily focuses on Apple's perceived lack of innovation in AI compared to other companies actively involved in AI development. An analyst downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, further contributes to negative sentiment. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it's lagging behind in generative AI applications for consumers. The article, while including Apple in a list of AI stocks, ultimately favors other AI stocks for potentially higher returns. The inclusion of Apple second place is moderately offsetting, however, the analyst downgrade will most likely have a significantly negative effect. The discussion around the Stargate initiative has limited direct relevance to AAPL. Therefore, the overwhelmingly negative tone suggests a higher probability of the stock price declining."

The company's revenue and earnings per share exceeded analyst projections, driven by a significant increase in the services division. Although iPhone sales decreased slightly, the company's outlook for future sales growth is positive. The stock's ability to protect itself during recent market volatility and its cautious approach to AI investments are also viewed positively. Based on these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news presents a mixed view of Apple's performance relative to its competitors in the tech sector. While Apple reported a modest increase in earnings and healthy net margins, concerns about demand in China and competition from local players, as well as skepticism about investment in AI, weigh heavily on investor sentiment. These factors are likely to create uncertainty about future growth and competitive positioning. However, Apple's status as a major player in the tech sector, combined with positive results compared to the general market trend, suggests a higher likelihood of maintaining its stock price. Given these competing dynamics, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced but slightly favor a rise due to the favorable earnings and market reaction."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While Apple has launched Apple Intelligence, analysts downgrade the stock citing a lack of AI innovation, slower iPhone growth, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst emphasizes that Apple's gradual rollout of its AI and the advancements of competitors make it difficult for Apple to outperform, and also states there's little upside to Apple's valuation due to uncertainty in Gen AI. The article does rank AAPL 2nd on the list of AI stocks listed in news, but emphasizes other AI stocks are more promising due to higher returns and shorter investment timeframes.

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news presents a mixed perspective on Apple Inc.'s performance relative to its competitors in the tech sector, highlighting both positive earnings growth and concerns regarding competition in China and AI. While Apple's earnings were up 7.1% on 4% higher revenues, the ongoing challenges in the Chinese market and local competition create a cloud of uncertainty. Despite these headwinds, the overall positive trend in the tech sector, along with Apple's historical strength and market presence, supports the probability of the stock price rising. Yet, significant caution remains due to competitive pressures and market skepticism. Thus, I estimate a moderate probability for a price rise, balanced against notable risks that may lead to a price decline."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Concerns about slower iPhone growth and challenges in the Chinese market further contribute to negative sentiment. Although Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' the article suggests it lags behind competitors in generative AI. The article mentions Apple is ranked 2nd on a list but also suggests other AI stocks are more promising. Elon Musk's Stargate dispute doesn't have strong direct impact on Apple. Previous predictions are varied, but some models emphasized less belief that Apple will gain benefit from AI. Considering the analyst downgrade, AI innovation concerns and the generally negative sentiment, the probability of stock price falling is higher."

This positive sector trend suggests a higher likelihood of Apple (AAPL) also seeing a rise in its stock price.

Some models emphasize positive earnings and sector trends, while others highlight concerns about AI competition and the Chinese market. The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the significant spread suggests considerable uncertainty.  Considering the incomplete news and the divergence of opinions in previous predictions, a cautious approach is best. I will weight the probabilities to reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly toward a rise based on the positive sector news but acknowledging that this might not translate to AAPL specifically."

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news presents a mixed bag for Apple Inc. (AAPL), highlighting positive earnings growth but also significant concerns regarding competition in the Chinese market and ongoing challenges with AI capabilities. Recent earnings results show a modest increase in revenues and net margins, which could generally support the stock price rising. However, the sentiment surrounding AI innovation and the comparative advantages perceived by other tech giants like Microsoft and Alphabet introduces caution among investors. While the overall tech sector shows a positive trend, including favorable market responses to earnings reports from other 'Mag 7' companies, ongoing uncertainties highlight a risk for AAPL. Given the mixed signals\u2014better-than-expected earnings juxtaposed with competitive pressures\u2014I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising against a backdrop of notable risks that may lead to a price decline."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline and content primarily focus on Apple's struggle with AI innovation compared to other companies. The analyst downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales outlook, AI innovation shortage, and issues within the Chinese market, suggests a negative sentiment. Furthermore, while Apple introduced 'Apple Intelligence,' it's seen as lagging behind other AI applications. The discussion regarding the Stargate project does not significantly influence Apple's stock. Prior predictions have diverged indicating uncertainty, although most point towards a slightly higher likelihood of price increase from earlier economic gains. Recent rounds show that those predictions are converging more tightly around a price decrease. Given the focus on AI shortcomings and analyst downgrades, the stock is more likely to decline. Considering previously round information, I give a high weight on its effect."

This positive sector trend suggests a higher likelihood of Apple (AAPL) also seeing a stock price rise. However, the lack of specific information about Apple's performance, coupled with the paywall preventing access to detailed news, necessitates a cautious approach. Analyzing previous predictions reveals a wide range of probabilities, reflecting differing interpretations of Apple's financial standing and AI market position. Some models emphasize positive earnings and sector trends, while others highlight AI competition and Chinese market challenges.  The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the significant spread in previous predictions highlights considerable uncertainty.  Therefore, the prediction leans slightly toward a rise, acknowledging that the positive sector news might not directly translate to AAPL's stock price. The lack of concrete company-specific information heavily influences this conservative estimate."

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news reflects a mixed sentiment regarding Apple's performance, presenting both opportunities and challenges. While Apple reported promising earnings growth and improved margins, concerns persist regarding demand in the critical Chinese market, competition from local rivals, and a perceived lag in AI innovation compared to peers like Microsoft and Alphabet. This complexity creates uncertainty, tempering the potential for substantial stock price increases despite overall positive trends in the technology sector. Therefore, a moderate probability of price rise is estimated, countered by significant risks that could drive the stock price lower."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of 10 AI Stocks on Latest News and Ratings. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on Apple's perceived struggles with AI innovation and an analyst downgrade citing weak iPhone sales outlook, challenges in the Chinese market, and a lack of AI innovation as major concerns. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence', the article suggests it is lagging behind competitors in generative AI, and analyst expects slower-than-expected iPhone sales, causing the analyst to believe it will be difficult for Apple to outperform. \n\nThe main negative sentiment surrounds AI innovation compared to other AI stocks. The discussion about the Stargate initiative is not directly related to Apple. Previous predictions displayed a trend of increasingly negative outlook for Apple due to the AI and sales related issue. Given the negative tone surrounding Apple's role in AI and the analyst downgrade, the probability of stock price decline is higher than a rise."

This suggests a potential positive influence on Apple's stock price. However, the lack of specific Apple-related information and the paywall preventing access to detailed news make it difficult to give a definitive prediction. Analyzing the previous predictions shows a wide range of probability estimates (0.25 to 0.8 for a price rise), reflecting varying interpretations of Apple's financial performance, its AI strategy, and its market position. Some models emphasized positive earnings and sector trends, while others highlighted concerns about AI competition, the Chinese market, and analyst downgrades.  The overall trend of predictions shows a slight leaning toward a higher probability of a price rise, but with considerable uncertainty due to conflicting information. Considering the incomplete news and the divergence of opinions, I maintain a moderately optimistic but cautious approach.  The significant uncertainty and mixed signals justify a prediction leaning slightly towards a rise, acknowledging the inherent volatility of the market and the possibility that the positive sector trend may not fully translate to Apple's stock performance."

CEO Tim Cook's positive comments on DeepSeek suggest that Apple sees opportunities rather than threats from the competition in AI. This, along with Apple\u2019s prudent approach to capital spending, could positively influence investor sentiment toward AAPL, leading to a higher probability of stock price increase."

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple (AAPL). On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek and its potentially more efficient AI models could put pressure on Apple to innovate faster and optimize its AI spending. Tim Cook's response hints at this acknowledgment, but also signals a welcoming of innovations that drive efficiency. This could be interpreted as slightly positive in the long run, implying cost savings and faster innovation cycles if Apple can leverage or adapt similar strategies. However, the news also highlights Apple's ongoing struggles in the Chinese market, where its revenue is down. This is a more immediate and concrete negative factor weighing on the stock. The global AI selloff that DeepSeek triggered did not significantly affect AAPL itself, so the direct impact of DeepSeek is mitigated by Tim Cook's response, but the news is not overwhelmingly positive. Given all these factors, the negative factors outweigh the positive, but not by a very large amount. The probability of a fall is slightly higher than the probability of a rise."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple (AAPL). While Apple is ranked highly on a list of AI stocks, an Oppenheimer analyst downgraded AAPL to \"Perform\" from \"Outperform\", citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market.  The analyst also points to the slow rollout of Apple Intelligence and a lack of consumer-facing generative AI apps.  The Stargate initiative, a large AI project unrelated to Apple's direct operations, is mentioned but has mixed signals regarding funding and ultimately doesn't heavily influence the AAPL outlook directly.  The overall sentiment leans slightly negative due to the analyst downgrade and concerns about AI innovation and iPhone sales. However, Apple's strong brand and diverse product line offer some mitigating factors. The probability of a price rise is therefore less than the probability of a price fall, but not drastically so, considering Apple's generally strong performance."

The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular?

Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role?

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news report presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the company's prospects. On the positive side, Apple provided a reassuring revenue forecast, with sales expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits, which is in line with analyst predictions. The services division, including the App Store and Apple Music, performed well, with revenue growing 14% to a record $26.3 billion. Additionally, the Mac and iPad lineups exceeded expectations. However, there are concerns about the company's performance in China, where revenue declined 11%, and the wearables, home, and accessories category also saw a decline. Furthermore, Apple faces challenges in competing with local brands in China and is behind its peers in artificial intelligence development. Considering these factors, the stock price may rise due to the positive forecast and strong services revenue, but the challenges in China and AI development may limit the upside. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

Tim Cook's response suggests Apple sees opportunity in driving efficiency, potentially positive in the long-term. However, the continued challenges in the Chinese market, where revenue is down 11% year-over-year, remain a significant concern.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While the Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate prospects, the Oppenheimer downgrade is significant. The downgrade cites concerns about weakening iPhone sales, a lack of AI innovation compared to competitors, and challenges in the Chinese market. These are all valid concerns that could negatively impact Apple's stock price.  However, Apple remains a massive and well-established company with a strong brand and diverse product line.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance in the AI space. Considering the negative analyst report and the relatively slow rollout of Apple's AI initiatives compared to competitors, the likelihood of a stock price fall seems slightly higher than a rise, but it's not a drastic difference given Apple's overall strength.  I'm taking into account the inconsistent predictions from previous rounds and weighing them with the current news sentiment."

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

However, there are concerns about the company's performance in China, where revenue declined 11%, and the wearables, home, and accessories category also saw a decline. Furthermore, Apple faces challenges in competing with local brands in China and is behind its peers in artificial intelligence development. Considering these factors, the stock price may rise due to the positive forecast and strong services revenue, but the challenges in China and AI development may limit the upside. The predictions from other models also suggest a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a stock price rise and others predicting a higher probability of a stock price fall. Taking into account the mixed news and the range of opinions from other models, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The rapid rise of Chinese start-up DeepSeek's new artificial intelligence model\u2013seemingly made on the cheap\u2013triggered a brutal selloff Monday, but tech stocks have pared back some of their losses since then.

The probabilities from other analyses reflect a mix of cautious optimism and lingering concerns.

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on the implications of DeepSeek's competitive AI models on Big Tech, including Apple. While the initial sell-off didn't significantly affect Apple, Tim Cook's comments acknowledging the potential for efficiency gains are a positive sign. However, the company's challenges in China, as highlighted in the article, remain concerning. Considering previous models' predictions, a trend emerges; the models recognize these opposing forces (China challenges vs AI optimism). Most models are leaning towards a greater probability of a fall overall in Round 1. I acknowledge Tim Cook's positivity around AI, and the ability for Apple to extract value from these innovations. That said, the Chinese market represents an important variable, and a persistent headwind for Apple's outlook. Therefore I am factoring this more heavily, and predicting a slightly higher probability in fall."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news is mixed.  While the Oppenheimer downgrade is a significant negative, citing concerns about weakening iPhone sales, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market,  it's important to consider Apple's overall strength and resilience.  The analyst's concerns are valid but don't necessarily paint a catastrophic picture of Apple's future.  The Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's short-term prospects.  Previous predictions show significant divergence, reflecting the uncertainty.  The downgrade significantly outweighs the vague positives within the article.  Furthermore, the continued focus on AI innovation by competitors puts pressure on Apple to respond effectively, adding to the uncertainty. Considering the negativity of the Oppenheimer downgrade and the lack of compelling positive news specific to AAPL, I assign a higher probability to a price fall, though I acknowledge the potential for resilience given Apple's track record and market dominance."

The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed picture for Apple Inc., with both positive and negative factors influencing the company's prospects. On the positive side, Apple provided a reassuring revenue forecast, with sales expected to grow in the low- to mid-single digits, which is in line with analyst predictions. The services division, including the App Store and Apple Music, performed well, with revenue growing 14% to a record $26.3 billion. Additionally, the Mac and iPad lineups exceeded expectations. However, there are concerns about the company's performance in China, where revenue declined 11%, and the wearables, home, and accessories category also saw a decline. Furthermore, Apple faces challenges in competing with local brands in China and is behind its peers in artificial intelligence development. Considering these factors and the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The news presents a mixed tone, but given the overall positive sentiment from Buffett's continued investment and strong financial performance, the probability of a stock price rise is higher. The mixed factors, including positive sentiments from Buffett and strong performance, offset the concerns about iPhone sales and Chinese market challenges."

Overall, there is a cautiously optimistic sentiment in the tech sector as fears related to DeepSeek fade, which may influence investor perception positively. However, the negative factors are notable, leading to a conservative estimate on the stock price rise. Based on the prior analyses, where predictions show a lean towards moderate optimism but recognize substantial risks, I estimate a slight edge towards a stock price rise due to the predominantly positive sentiment in tech and Apple's strong market position."

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

However, challenges in the Chinese market and slower AI advancements compared to competitors remain concerns. Previous predictions in earlier rounds were divergent, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of price rise, while others favored a higher probability of price fall, but generally showing a trend over time of slightly reducing the stock rising prediction percentages. Considering Tim Cook's positive comments and Apple's strong financial performance offset by China market challenges and competitor AI pressures, I adjust downward and predict a near-equal probability of price rise and fall, weighted very slightly towards the fall due to concerns in the Chinese market, the Oppenheimer downgrade, and competitive pressures in generative AI. Taking into consideration all previous estimations, this seems the most reasonable output, considering market conditions and Apple's current place in it."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  The Oppenheimer downgrade is a significant negative, highlighting concerns about weakening iPhone sales, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. These are serious concerns that could negatively impact Apple's stock price. However, Apple remains a massive, established company with a strong brand and diverse product portfolio. The Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate prospects.  Previous predictions from multiple models show significant divergence, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance in the AI space and the broader tech market.  While some models are optimistic due to Apple\u2019s strong brand and financial performance, the analyst downgrade and the lack of significant positive AI news carry considerable weight.  The concerns about China and AI innovation outweigh the potential positives, particularly in the short term.  Considering the negative analyst report and the relatively slow rollout of Apple's AI initiatives compared to competitors, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The fluctuating predictions across different models in previous rounds reinforce the uncertainty of the situation and make a decisive prediction difficult."

The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

However, Apple's struggles in the Chinese market (revenue down 11% year-over-year) and concerns about its pace of AI innovation compared to competitors are significant headwinds. Considering that previous rounds show a general decline in the probability of the stock price rising, mostly driven by model's consideration of the challenges in the Chinese market and less compelling AI advantages with APPL. The Oppenheimer downgrade cited in previous rounds has some weight. The positives are Apple's strong brand, financial performance, and market position. I am giving slightly higher weight to these challenges, adjusting to a near equal with downward trend."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This is a substantial negative, outweighing the generally positive sentiment expressed by some models around Tim Cook's comments and Apple's strong financial fundamentals (as reported in some, but not all news sources used by the LLM models). The Stargate initiative is largely irrelevant.  While Apple's brand strength and diverse product line offer some mitigation, the analyst downgrade specifically targets key areas of concern.  The analysis of previous predictions shows significant disagreement, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future and the broader tech market. However the trend seems to lean slightly towards a stock price fall.Considering the significant negative of the Oppenheimer downgrade and the lack of strong positive news directly related to Apple's AI or future prospects, I assign a higher probability to a price fall."

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Apple's stock price fell 0.7% to $237.59 after announcing a cash dividend and reporting increased earnings and revenue. Considering the mixed performance of Apple in various markets and its recent financial reports, there is a cautious optimism due to strong financials but concerns about market challenges. The absence of directly relevant news about Apple's AI or cloud initiatives suggests a neutral to slightly negative impact from this specific article. Based on the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than the probability of it falling due to the concerns in the Chinese market and AI development."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?",
                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While DeepSeek's emergence initially caused a tech stock sell-off, Tim Cook's response is cautiously optimistic, suggesting that innovations driving efficiency are a good thing. This indicates a somewhat neutral stance, with Apple acknowledging the potential benefits of the AI model. However, Apple's existing issues in China, with revenue down 11% year over year, create uncertainty. Despite this challanges, Apple stock avoided the initial DeepSeek sell-off, indicating relative resilience. Considering these factors, the chances of a rise and a fall are somewhat evenly balanced. The previous rounds of predictions from other models are highly variable. Some predict a higher chance of a fall because of the China headwinds, while others were a higher chance of a rise due to the 'reassuring' revenue forecast, indicating there isn't a specific consensus. Weighing these factors and taking into account Tim Cook's comments, the stock may experience a slight upward bias."

Tim Cook's positive comments and mention of prudent capital spending further contribute to a positive outlook. However, the news lacks strong, specific positive catalysts for Apple's stock price. The overall market sentiment is improving, but this is a generalized effect rather than something unique to Apple. Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinions. Some models emphasize the potential for negative impacts (competition, China market challenges), while others focus on the general market rebound and Apple's resilience.  Weighing the generally favorable news with the lack of specific positive drivers for Apple and the mixed opinions from other models, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, but it remains relatively modest."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

Other models in previous rounds show diverging opinions, factoring in aspects from China challenges to reassuring revenue forecasts, lack of clear catalysts.

Cook's positive comments and prudent spending approach further enhance this positive outlook. However, the news lacks strong, company-specific catalysts for a significant price surge in Apple stock. The positive sentiment is more of a general market effect rather than something unique to Apple's performance.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals considerable divergence, highlighting uncertainty.  Some models correctly point out persistent challenges, such as underperformance in China and competition in AI.  Weighing the generally positive market trend with the absence of specific Apple-related positive drivers, and considering the mixed prior predictions, a slightly higher chance of a price rise than a fall is assigned, but the probabilities remain close to even."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

However, the company faces challenges in China, with an 11% decline in revenue, and struggles in AI development. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions, I estimated the probabilities based on the mixed results and ongoing challenges. The fact that Apple's revenue forecast was reassuring and services revenue grew, suggests some resilience in the company's performance, but the challenges in China and AI development, along with the cancellation of an augmented reality glasses project, introduce significant uncertainties. Thus, I assessed the probability of the stock price rising slightly lower than the probability of it falling, reflecting the mixed sentiment and the balance of positive and negative factors."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

Some lean toward a negative outlook due to challenges in China and concerns about AI competition and project cancellations, while others see resilience and potential market rebound. Given the limited direct positive implications for Apple, continuing challenges in China and AI space and mixed sentiments displayed by models in previous rounds, the probability of stock price falling should be slightly higher."

The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a fall, reflecting the overall improved market sentiment and Apple's resilience, but the probabilities remain relatively close due to the persisting uncertainties. The consistent prediction of a slightly higher probability of a fall across multiple rounds from several models, particularly regarding China's market performance, is weighed against the overall positive market sentiment and Cook's statement."

(AAPL) that could directly impact its stock price. However, based on the general sector update and previous predictions from other models, it can be inferred that tech stocks are experiencing mixed trends. Some models predict a higher chance of a stock price rise due to resilience in tech stocks and positive market trends, while others predict a higher chance of a fall due to macroeconomic concerns, competition in AI, and challenges in China. The mixed sentiment and balance of positive and negative factors suggest that the stock price movement probabilities remain relatively balanced. However, considering the lack of specific positive drivers for Apple's stock and the general market trend, I assign a slightly higher probability to a potential stock price rise due to resilience in tech stocks but also consider the challenges faced by Apple, such as competition and macroeconomic factors."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

However, Apple's overall strong financial position and diversified product lines may mitigate drastic negative reactions in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of stock price fall than rise in response to this news."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

The company's cautious approach to AI has also insulated it from recent market turmoil affecting other Big Tech stocks. However, there are significant risks, including renewed tariff threats from former President Trump, which could spark trade wars and inflationary pressures, and the upcoming PCE inflation data that might influence Federal Reserve policy. While the positive earnings outlook and market momentum are strong, the broader uncertainties from geopolitical and economic factors temper the optimism. Considering the balance of these factors and the previous predictions, which leaned slightly towards a positive outlook, the probability of a stock price rise is marginally higher than a fall."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro.

It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others.

The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset.

Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The cancellation of Apple's Mac-connected augmented reality glasses project indicates ongoing challenges in their innovation strategy, particularly in a key growth area for technology and consumer products. This decision, along with slow sales for the high-priced Apple Vision Pro, raises concerns about Apple's ability to maintain competitive momentum in the augmented reality market. Given the historical context of recent project cancellations and struggles in consumer adoption, investor sentiment may take a hit, leading to a higher probability of stock price decline. However, Apple's overall solid financial position, diversification, and established brand may provide some resilience against drastic price drops. Thus, while the probability of a stock price fall is higher in response to this news, the overall impact may be moderated by investor confidence in Apple's long-term prospects."

Taking into account the Round 0 and Round 1 predictions, the Gemini models consistently highlighted the positive earnings news, while other models focused on concerns regarding Apple's AR projects. The fact that the stock *is* rising should outweigh those older concerns. While broader market factors related to trade and inflation always present a risk, the immediate impact of the positive earnings report takes precedence, pushing the likelihood of a rise higher. Additionally, given the time passed since Round 0, the news of earnings has had time to settle and influence the current stock movement, solidifying the positive trend. The consistent positive reporting of earnings and guidance cannot be dismissed. The earnings trumps the AR concerns."

Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting this ambiguity. Some models highlight Apple's overall strength and positive earnings, while others focus on limitations in AI progress and potential market corrections.  Considering the mixed signals and the temporary nature of the 'DeepSeek' boost, the probability of a rise is lower than it would be with stronger AI-related news.  The chance of a correction once the 'DeepSeek' effect subsides increases the likelihood of a fall.  The overall uncertainty leads to a probability closer to 50/50, but slightly favoring a fall given the lack of sustained positive drivers."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

However, potential negatives include broader market uncertainty due to Trump's tariff threats, which could impact global trade and inflation, and the upcoming PCE inflation data that might influence Federal Reserve policy. Additionally, while Apple's earnings outlook is positive, concerns about iPhone sales missing estimates and the lack of immediate AI-driven upgrades temper the optimism. Balancing these factors, the positive earnings outlook and market momentum seem to slightly outweigh the broader uncertainties, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise."

This cancellation, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may raise concerns about Apple's ability to innovate and compete in this market. While Apple is a large and diversified company with a strong track record of innovation, the cumulative effect of canceling multiple promising projects and the struggle to gain traction in new markets could dampen investor sentiment. However, the company's strong financial position and diversified product lines may mitigate drastic negative reactions in the short term. Considering these factors and the mixed opinions from previous predictions, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price falling due to the news."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary.

Previous predictions show considerable disagreement, some highlighting positive earnings, others focusing on Apple's challenges in AR and AI.  The consistent mention of Apple's stock rise due to better-than-expected earnings and positive growth guidance suggests a short-term positive trend. However, the lack of AI-driven momentum and the unclear nature of the 'DeepSeek' boost, make a sustained upward trend less likely. The concerns about AR and AI, while present, seem to be outweighed by the positive earnings information in the shorter term.  Therefore, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a rise in the short term, acknowledging the considerable uncertainty and the possibility of a correction after the 'DeepSeek' effect fades."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, some emphasizing Apple's overall strength and positive earnings, others focusing on limitations of its AI progress and potential market corrections. The consistent mention of Apple's stock rise due to better-than-expected earnings and positive growth guidance across multiple rounds suggests a short-term upward trend driven primarily by this positive financial news. However, the lack of AI-driven momentum and the unclear nature of the 'DeepSeek' boost create uncertainty about the sustainability of this upward trend. The concerns about AR and AI, while present, seem to be outweighed by the positive earnings information in the shorter term.  Therefore, the probability of a rise is higher in the short-term due to the positive earnings news. Over the longer term, the lack of significant AI advancements and the temporary nature of the 'DeepSeek' boost increase uncertainty, and introduce a risk of correction.

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

The company's cautious approach to AI has also insulated it from recent market turmoil. However, potential negatives include broader market uncertainty due to Trump's tariff threats, which could impact global trade and inflation, and the upcoming PCE inflation data that might influence Federal Reserve policy. Additionally, while Apple's earnings outlook is positive, concerns about iPhone sales missing estimates and the lack of immediate AI-driven upgrades temper the optimism. Balancing these factors, the positive earnings outlook and market momentum seem to slightly outweigh the broader uncertainties, suggesting a higher probability of a stock price rise."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

However, Apple's capital expenditure strategy, leveraging other companies' investments, positions them favorably in the AI race, mitigating risks compared to companies like Meta and Microsoft. The analyst believes DeepSeek poses less of a threat to Apple and the previous rounds demonstrate volatility with overall positive recent predictions.

Considering the mixed signals within the news itself and the divergence in previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price increase is warranted.

Annually, it is expected to stay put at 2.8%, according to economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe central bank held interest rates steady in its latest rate decision earlier this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell said there would be no rush to cut them again until inflation and jobs data made it appropriate to do so.\n\nIntel advanced 2% after the chipmaker posted December-quarter results that beat analysts' low expectations, while its forecast for current-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nOil majors Chevron and Exxon Mobil are among the major companies scheduled to report quarterly earnings before the bell on Friday.\n\nAt 04:51 a.m. ET, Dow E-minis were up 131 points, or 0.29%, S&P 500 E-minis were up 24.5 points, or 0.4% and Nasdaq 100 E-minis were up 153.5 points, or 0.71%.\n\nThe S&P 500 as well as the Nasdaq were set for weekly losses as tech shares suffered a rout earlier this week after Chinese startup DeepSeek unveiled a breakthrough in cheap artificial-intelligence models, triggering a bloodbath in AI-linked stocks.\n\nMicrosoft plunged more than 6% on Thursday following a disappointing growth forecast in its cloud computing business, exacerbating broader losses.\n\nDespite this week's volatility, all three major indexes were on track for monthly gains, with the S&P 500 less than 1% from its all-time high, hit last week.\n\nJanuary has been a mixed month for equities in this century, with the S&P 500's returns flat on average since 2000, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\nMeanwhile, global markets remained vigilant after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that the United States would impose a 25% tariff on imports from Mexico and Canada, repeating his warning ahead of his previously announced Saturday deadline.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAmong other early movers, Deckers Outdoor dropped 14.6% after the UGG bootmaker's annual sales forecast raise fell short of investors' lofty expectations after a strong holiday quarter.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance lost 10.5% after the pharmacy chain operator suspended its quarterly cash dividend amid restructuring efforts.\n\n(Reporting by Shashwat Chauhan in Bengaluru; Editing by Pooja Desai)\n\nView Comments",

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

The cautious approach towards AI and its potential benefits have also positively impacted investor sentiment. Moreover, the overall revenue and earnings have beaten the estimates, offsetting the concern over lower iPhone sales in some regions. Although there are some regional concerns and mixed signals, the general tone of the news is optimistic with a rosier sales outlook, which typically leads to an increase in stock price. The previous rounds of predictions indicate a high confidence in the stock price rising, despite some mixed signals. Overall, there is a consensus among the predictions that Apple's stock is likely to rise."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The failure to bring this project to market, combined with the slow sales of the Apple Vision Pro, may lead to concerns about Apple's competitiveness in the emerging AR and VR markets. However, Apple's diverse product portfolio, strong brand loyalty, and ongoing investments in other technologies, such as AI and custom microLED screens, may mitigate the negative impact.

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands.

Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

Analyzing the previous prediction rounds reveals a general trend towards a higher probability of a price rise, though opinions diverge significantly.  Models emphasizing the positive earnings beat tend toward higher probabilities of a rise, while models focusing on the mixed performance and potential external factors (tariffs, geopolitical uncertainty) lean towards lower probabilities or even a higher chance of a fall.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "headline": "Futures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets",
                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

The strong earnings outlook suggests a likelihood of stock price increase, but ongoing tariff concerns could dampen enthusiasm.

A rising personal consumption and expenditures index usually translates into investors being bearish. However, the headline also notes MicroStrategy making a move along with NVIDIA. The article doesn't explicitly claim Apple also making moves. Considering the tariff order and potential technical breakdown, a negative outlook is slightly more probable. MicroStrategy making moves alongside Nvidia might not be directly tied to Apple's potential. The rising inflation rate also contributes to bearish sentiment."

While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure (due to its hybrid CapEx model),  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily because of concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, which is seen as being negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending.  The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is lower than the probability of it staying the same or falling slightly."

Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

Despite the positive guidance for sales growth following the latest earnings report, concerns regarding Trump's tariff threats and their potential impact on inflation and market sentiment add uncertainty. Comparatively, the forecasts suggest an overall bullish outlook due to Apple's recent performance and the resilience shown relative to its competitors. This leads to a higher probability of the stock price increasing than decreasing, albeit with caution due to external factors like tariffs and inflation metrics."

However the move from Microstrategy might provide positive sentiment for the broader market, which in turn also impact the Apple stock. I am also observing that the previous rounds include a diverse set of predictions, some being very positive, while others are very negative on the stock. The distribution is wide, suggesting that the general trend is unclear. Since I am observing some uncertainty in the predictions of other models, I am going to assign similar probabilities of price rising and falling. I will give a slight edge to the price falling given the slightly bearish overall sentiment."

While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure due to its hybrid CapEx model, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending. The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook.  Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.85 probability of a price increase, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the impact of the news. Considering the mixed signals and the analyst's cautious outlook, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining relatively stable or experiencing a minor decline, rather than a significant increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news related directly to Apple's performance tips the balance slightly towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook."

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple Inc., with positive earnings guidance suggesting growth momentum, particularly in iPhone sales. However, external concerns like President Trump's tariff threats and rising inflation metrics introduce significant uncertainty, which could dampen investor sentiment. While Apple's strong earnings report supports a bullish viewpoint, external factors and the mixed predictions from previous analyses necessitate a balanced approach. Thus, after considering the positive earnings outlook and external risks, I estimate that there is a higher likelihood of the stock price rising than falling, but with caution due to external pressures."

The Dow's decline due to potential tariffs and the breaking of a 'key level' are bearish indicators. The rise in the personal Consumption and Expenditures (PCE) index also introduces another bearish sentiment due to rising inflation. However, MicroStrategy making moves alongside Nvidia may have a positive impact for the broader technology sector. Considering the previous predictions, there's a lack of clear consensus. The predictions range from very bullish to very bearish, reflecting the uncertainty in the market or potential hidden information. The shift this round from a generally mixed stance to a more bearish stance in some models suggests that the tariff concerns and inflationary pressures might be gaining more weight in the analysis. Considering the mixed signals but the trend toward concerns about inflation and the tariff order, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling."

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure (due to its hybrid CapEx model), he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The analyst's concern outweighs the positive aspect of Apple's strategic advantage in AI spending. The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' or significant upgrade cycle fueled by AI further dampens the positive outlook.  Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.85 probability of a price increase, reflecting uncertainty surrounding the impact of the news.  Considering the mixed signals and the analyst's cautious outlook, and the wide range of previous predictions, I lean towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price remaining relatively stable, with a slightly higher chance of a minor decline than a significant increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news related directly to Apple's performance tips the balance slightly towards a neutral to slightly negative outlook."

Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets.

Despite a positive earnings report with guidance indicating growth in sales, external factors such as President Trump's tariff threats and potential inflation pressures introduce significant uncertainty. Though the strong earnings and outlook for the iPhone could boost investor sentiment, the rising inflation and potential implications of tariffs may temper enthusiasm. Given the varied predictions from other models and the overall market sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with caution due to the external factors at play."

All of these are bearish signals. However, MicroStrategy making a move, possibly an investment, could be a positive sign for the tech sector, though its direct impact on Apple is less certain. Looking at the trend of previous predictions, there has been a shift from a more bullish stance towards a more cautious or bearish one, particularly in Google's models. Models that focus on the positive aspects of previous earning results remain somewhat bullish. Considering the mix of negative signals in the news and the overall trend towards a more bearish outlook in recent predictions, I am placing a slightly higher probability on the stock price falling. However, I will note that there could be positive sentiment among the market given MicroStrategy's move."

While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure due to its hybrid CapEx model, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock.  Concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts, overshadow the positive AI aspect. The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' further dampens the outlook.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting uncertainty.  The consensus leans slightly towards a rise, but the lack of strong positive news specific to Apple and the presence of significant concerns mean a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more probable. I've weighted the previous predictions to give more weight to those that seem to focus most on this specific news, while also acknowledging the overall uncertainty."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

However, external factors like Trump's tariff threats and rising inflation metrics introduce significant uncertainty that could dampen investor sentiment. Evaluating the predictions from various models, there is a general split between positive earnings sentiment and concerns over external risks. Given these circumstances, I estimate a higher likelihood of the stock price rising, albeit with caution due to the external pressures."

The Dow Jones's decline due to Trump's tariff order and Apple breaking a key level are negative indicators. Rising inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption and Expenditures (PCE) index, can also dampen investor sentiment. However, there is a potential positive signal from MicroStrategy's move. Considering previous predictions, there's a downward trend in the expected stock price. Models analyzing potential external headwinds of tarrifs and inflation tend to be bearish while those focused on Apple's earnings tend to be bullish. Given these mixed signals and trends, a slightly higher probability of a stock price decrease seems plausible."

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less vulnerable position compared to other Big Tech companies regarding AI-related capital expenditure due to its hybrid CapEx model, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns over the iPhone upgrade cycle, negatively impacted by mismatched hardware and software rollouts. The lack of a predicted 'super-cycle' further dampens the outlook.  Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.85 probability of a price increase, reflecting significant uncertainty.  The consensus among the previous models leans slightly towards a rise, but the lack of strong positive news specific to Apple and the presence of significant concerns (iPhone upgrade cycle, external economic factors) suggest a neutral to slightly negative outlook is more probable.  Considering the analyst's cautious outlook, the mixed signals in the news, and the diverse range of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable or experiencing a minor decline rather than a significant increase. The weight of the previous predictions is factored in, acknowledging individual model strengths and biases.  However, the lack of a definitive positive catalyst outweighs the mixed signals."
