(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

While it acknowledges Apple's presence in the AI space with 'Apple Intelligence,' it highlights concerns about the company's innovation pace compared to competitors. The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weaker iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market, is a significant negative signal. The analyst's expectation of slower iPhone growth and Apple's uncertain role in generative AI adoption further contribute to a bearish sentiment. The article also mentions that other AI stocks might offer higher returns in a shorter timeframe, suggesting that investors might shift their focus away from Apple. While the article mentions Apple being second on their list of AI stocks, the overall tone leans towards caution regarding Apple's AI prospects and its valuation. The negative analyst rating and concerns about AI innovation outweigh the positive mention of Apple Intelligence. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

However, Apple continues to work on other AR/VR projects, including successors to the Vision Pro, and maintains strong revenue from other segments like Wearables and Services.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The lack of specific information in the accessible news makes it difficult to definitively weigh these conflicting factors.  However, the preponderance of negative predictions in previous rounds, particularly those citing concerns about AI innovation and weakening iPhone sales, suggests a bearish bias.  While the general tech sector strength offers some support for a price rise, the more specific concerns about Apple outweigh this general positive trend.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

The CEOs of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple have taken an optimistic tone, suggesting that DeepSeek's innovations could benefit the industry and drive efficiency. However, the article also mentions that Apple's revenue in China was down 11% year over year, which could be a concern for the company. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mixed outlook for Apple's stock price. Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive tone from the CEOs and the potential benefits of DeepSeek's innovations, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about Apple's innovation pace and revenue decline in China. Taking into account the overall tone of the article and the previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but with a cautious outlook due to the mixed signals."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple Inc. canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is a significant setback in its AR/VR efforts, following the lukewarm reception of the Apple Vision Pro and previous project cancellations like the self-driving car. This cancellation signals challenges in innovation and execution, which could negatively impact investor confidence. However, Apple continues to work on other AR/VR projects, including successors to the Vision Pro, and maintains strong revenue from other segments like Wearables and Services. The mixed signals (negative due to project cancellation but positive due to ongoing innovation and strong core business) suggest a moderate negative impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a negative outlook, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than it rising."

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

The Oppenheimer downgrade, citing weak iPhone sales outlook, lack of AI innovation, and challenges in China, reinforces this negative sentiment. While Apple has launched 'Apple Intelligence,' analysts believe it will be difficult for Apple to outperform due to slower iPhone growth and its uncertain role in generative AI. The article also suggests other AI stocks might offer higher returns faster. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, but the negative aspects related to AI innovation and analyst downgrades seem to outweigh the positives. The trend in previous predictions shows a shift towards a more negative outlook. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to the stock price falling. The Stargate initiative discussion is largely irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock performance. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the negative sentiment surrounding Apple's AI innovation, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than rising."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

Some models predict a higher probability of the stock price rising due to the positive tone from the CEOs and the potential benefits of DeepSeek's innovations, while others predict a higher probability of the stock price falling due to concerns about Apple's innovation pace and revenue decline in China. Taking into account the overall tone of the article and the previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly lower than the probability of it falling, due to the mixed signals and the cautious outlook."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips.

The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

On one hand, the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese AI startup, raises concerns about increased competition and potential cost efficiencies in AI development, which could indirectly benefit Apple. Tim Cook's comment suggests a positive view on innovation that drives efficiency. However, the article also mentions Apple's revenue being down 11% year-over-year in China, which is a significant negative factor. The overall impact is likely to be slightly negative, as the China revenue decline is a more immediate and direct concern than the potential long-term benefits of DeepSeek's innovations. The market's initial reaction (avoiding the DeepSeek sell-off) suggests some resilience, but the China issue is a persistent headwind."

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past.

While Q4 earnings beat expectations and showed positive net margin expansion, significant headwinds exist. Tepid iPhone demand in China, intensified competition from local rivals, and potential tariff impacts are major concerns.  The positive market reaction to Apple's earnings was characterized as a 'sigh of relief,' suggesting cautious optimism rather than strong confidence.  The emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on AI spending by competitors introduces uncertainty, although Apple's own AI struggles are also highlighted.  While the broader tech sector shows positive growth projections, Apple's specific challenges in China and AI weigh heavily. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions showing a range from 0.25 to 0.8 probability of a price rise, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the significant downside risks."

The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

DeepSeek's emergence and the optimistic responses from Big Tech CEOs like Tim Cook suggest potential benefits from increased efficiency and innovation in AI. However, Apple's declining revenue in China remains a significant concern. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty. Some models lean towards a price decrease due to concerns about innovation and China revenue, while others are more optimistic. Considering the mixed signals and the trend of previous predictions, I'm slightly adjusting towards a more neutral outlook, acknowledging both the potential benefits and the existing challenges. The fact that Apple avoided the initial DeepSeek sell-off is a positive sign, but the China issue is persistent."

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

Tepid iPhone demand in China, increased competition, and potential tariffs pose substantial headwinds. The positive market reaction was described as a 'sigh of relief,' indicating cautious optimism rather than strong confidence.  The emergence of DeepSeek adds uncertainty regarding AI spending and competitive dynamics.  While the broader tech sector shows positive growth projections, Apple's specific challenges outweigh the general positive sentiment.  Analyzing the previous predictions, there's a wide range of probabilities for a price rise (0.25 to 0.8), reflecting the uncertainty. Considering the mixed signals and the significant downside risks, a slightly pessimistic outlook is warranted, but not overwhelmingly so. The overall market sentiment and strong sector projections offer some support, preventing an extremely negative prediction."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The downgrade from Oppenheimer highlights a weaker outlook for iPhone sales and ongoing issues in the Chinese market, contributing to negative sentiment. Additionally, the lack of generative AI applications and a slower iPhone replacement cycle suggest difficulties in maintaining its premium valuation. While there are some mixed signals regarding competition and potential long-term benefits, the overall sentiment leans negative due to immediate concerns raised in the news. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. DeepSeek's emergence as a competitor in the AI space initially caused a tech sell-off, but the responses from Big Tech CEOs, including Tim Cook, were optimistic, suggesting potential benefits from increased efficiency and innovation. However, Apple's declining revenue in China remains a significant concern. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty. Some models lean towards a price decrease due to concerns about innovation and China revenue, while others are more optimistic. The fact that Apple avoided the initial DeepSeek sell-off is a positive sign, but the China issue is persistent. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the mixed signals, I'm slightly adjusting towards a more neutral outlook, acknowledging both the potential benefits and the existing challenges. The China revenue decline and the increasing competition in AI are significant headwinds, but the overall market sentiment and the potential for efficiency gains from DeepSeek's innovations offer some support. Given the slightly negative trend in the previous rounds, I will slightly decrease the probability of stock price rise."

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

The emergence of DeepSeek and its impact on AI spending by competitors introduces further uncertainty, although Apple's own AI struggles are also highlighted. The overall tech sector shows positive growth projections, but Apple's specific challenges in China and AI weigh heavily.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of probabilities for a price rise (0.25 to 0.8), reflecting the considerable uncertainty.  Considering the mixed signals and the significant downside risks, a slightly pessimistic outlook is warranted, but not overwhelmingly so. The overall market sentiment and strong sector projections offer some support, preventing an extremely negative prediction.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the emergence of DeepSeek and the optimistic responses from Big Tech CEOs like Tim Cook suggest potential benefits from increased efficiency and innovation in AI, Apple's declining revenue in China remains a significant concern. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the uncertainty. Some models lean towards a price decrease due to concerns about innovation and China revenue, while others are more optimistic. The fact that Apple avoided the initial DeepSeek sell-off is a positive sign, but the China issue is persistent. Considering the trend of previous predictions and the mixed signals, I'm slightly adjusting towards a more neutral outlook, acknowledging both the potential benefits and the existing challenges. The China revenue decline and the increasing competition in AI are significant headwinds, but the overall market sentiment and the potential for efficiency gains from DeepSeek's innovations offer some support. Given the slightly negative trend in the previous rounds, I will slightly decrease the probability of stock price rise."

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  Positive factors include exceeding Q4 earnings expectations and positive net margin expansion.  However, significant negative factors outweigh these positives.  Tepid iPhone demand in China, intensified competition from local rivals, and the potential impact of tariffs are major concerns. The 'sigh of relief' market reaction to earnings suggests a lack of strong confidence.  The emergence of DeepSeek adds uncertainty to the AI landscape, although Apple's own AI struggles are also highlighted. While the broader tech sector shows positive growth projections, Apple's specific challenges in China and AI are substantial headwinds.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty.  The consistent negative sentiment regarding China sales and AI competitiveness across multiple prediction rounds weighs heavily on the overall assessment.  Considering the significant downside risks and the persistent negative trends in previous predictions, the probability of a price fall is deemed higher than a price rise."

                                    "content": "The DeepSeek app is displayed on an iPhone screen. - Illustration: Justin Sullivan (Getty Images)\n\nEarlier this week, Chinese artificial intelligence startup DeepSeek sparked a sell-off of global tech stocks that lost the AI-driven stock rally $1 trillion in value.\n\nThe Hangzhou-based company launched its open-source DeepSeek-R1 AI reasoning models the previous week, declaring them on par with those from OpenAI and Anthropic. In December, the startup released DeepSeek-V3, an AI model it said cost just $5.6 million to train and develop on just under 2,050 of Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) reduced-capability H800 chips. V3, according to the startup\u2019s technical paper, performed comparably to OpenAI\u2019s GPT-4o and Meta\u2019s (META) Llama 3.1 models, which use a much larger quantity of Nvidia\u2019s more powerful chips.\n\nDeepSeek\u2019s cheaper-yet-competitive models have raised questions over Big Tech\u2019s big spending on AI infrastructure. Unsurprisingly, the Chinese startup made its way into Big Tech earnings calls this week, and the chief executives of Microsoft, Meta, and Apple took an optimistic tone while discussing what DeepSeek\u2019s models could mean for the industry.\n\nHere\u2019s what Big Tech is saying about DeepSeek.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nDespite launching an investigation this week over whether a group associated with DeepSeek obtained data output from OpenAI\u2019s AI models in violation of the startup\u2019s terms of service, Microsoft launched DeepSeek-R1 on its Azure AI Foundry (MSFT) and GitHub.\n\nMicrosoft chief executive Satya Nadella said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that developers will also be able to run the startup\u2019s distilled reasoning models on Copilot+ PCs soon.\n\nIn response to an analyst\u2019s question about DeepSeek, Nadella said he thinks it \u201chas had some real innovations.\u201d As AI reasoning models such as those from DeepSeek and OpenAI get \u201ccommoditized\u201d and \u201cbroadly used,\u201d Nadella said customers will be \u201cthe big beneficiaries\u201d of that software cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen token prices fall, inference computing prices fall, that means people can consume more, and there will be more apps written,\u201d Nadella said.\n\nMeta\n\nMeta chief executive Mark Zuckerberg, who touts open-source AI models as \u201cgood for the world,\u201d said during the company\u2019s earnings call on Wednesday that DeepSeek did \u201ca number of novel things\u201d with its open-source models that the industry is \u201cstill digesting,\u201d and that the startup has made \u201cadvances that we will hope to implement in our systems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s part of the nature of how this works,\u201d he said, \u201cwhether it\u2019s a Chinese competitor or not.\u201d\n\nHowever, Zuckerberg said it\u2019s too early to have a strong opinion on what DeepSeek means for the trajectory of Meta\u2019s plans for AI infrastructure and capital expenditures.\n\nLa historia contin\u00faa\n\nEarlier this month, Zuckerberg said Meta is planning to invest between $60 billion and $65 billion in capex on AI this year. The company is also building a data center with a capacity of more than two gigawatts, he said \u2014 a site that could cover a large part of Manhattan. Meta plans to bring about one gigawatt of compute online this year, Zuckerberg said, and will end the year with more than 1.3 million graphics processing units, or GPUs.\n\nApple\n\nWhile Apple (AAPL) stock avoided the DeepSeek sell-off, Apple chief executive Tim Cook was asked by an analyst for his \u201cworldly perspective\u201d on the AI startup and its implications for the iPhone maker\u2019s business.\n\n\u201cIn general, I think innovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d Cook said. \u201cYou know, that\u2019s what you see in that model.\u201d\n\nHowever, Apple is facing another problem in China, with its revenue being down 11% year over year for the quarter ended in December.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nVer comentarios",

Apple's stock also avoided the initial sell-off triggered by DeepSeek's announcement, indicating some resilience. However, Apple's significant revenue decline in China (down 11% year-over-year) is a notable negative factor. The market's reaction to the news appears mixed, with some models leaning slightly positive due to the optimistic tone from Big Tech leaders, while others highlight the immediate concerns in China. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the overall sentiment remains cautious."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article focuses on the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and its potential performance in 2025, with a significant portion of the fund's assets concentrated in Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT). While the article acknowledges the long-term growth potential of AI and the tech sector, it raises concerns about the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft and the strategic challenges faced by Apple. The article suggests that Apple's shift towards following AI trends rather than leading them could erode its premium market positioning. This, coupled with the concentration risk and potential overvaluation of key holdings, introduces uncertainty about VGT's ability to outperform the S&P 500 in 2025. The article also highlights the emergence of cost-effective AI models from Chinese companies, which could impact the investment thesis for U.S. tech leaders. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price decline for Apple, the concerns raised about its strategic direction and potential erosion of market positioning suggest a higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise in the short term.

                                    "headline": "Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses",
                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The failure of N107, following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro, suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this technology.  This could lead to investor concern about Apple's future growth prospects in a potentially lucrative but challenging market. However, the news is not catastrophic. Apple is still investing in AR/VR technology and has other projects underway.  The overall impact on the stock price is likely to be muted, with a slightly higher probability of a minor price decrease due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation.  The existing positive sentiment around Apple's overall performance and other product lines will likely mitigate any significant negative impact."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news highlights Warren Buffett's long-term investment in Apple Inc. (AAPL), which generally instills confidence among investors due to his reputation as a successful value investor. However, there are concerns regarding iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges that could negatively impact investor sentiment. Despite these concerns, the overall strong revenue growth and continued support from analysts suggest a balanced view. The mixed signals from analysts regarding future sales and the cautious stance of Buffett indicate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but the potential for a price fall due to negative sales outlooks cannot be ignored."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "headline": "Apple Scraps Work on Mac-Connected Augmented Reality Glasses",
                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The cancellation reflects challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's difficulties in creating a consumer-friendly product in this space. This adds to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro. However, the news isn't catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects.  The overall impact is likely to be small, with a slightly higher probability of a minor price decrease due to negative sentiment.  The existing positive sentiment around Apple's overall performance and other product lines will likely mitigate any significant negative impact.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news. Considering the overall strength of Apple and the relatively niche nature of the canceled project, a significant drop is unlikely.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism about Apple's stock price, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise than a fall. However, it's essential to note that the predictions are based on different news articles and contexts, which might not be directly comparable. Nevertheless, the overall sentiment suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

However, there are concerns regarding iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges that could negatively impact investor sentiment.

The mixed signals from analysts regarding future sales and the cautious stance of Buffett indicate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but the potential for a price fall due to negative sales outlooks cannot be ignored. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general sentiment that Apple's stock might see a positive movement due to AI-related sales, but concerns about the limited rollout and other market factors keep the probabilities relatively balanced."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple canceling its AR glasses project (N107) is negative, but likely to have a muted impact on the stock price in the short term. The cancellation reflects challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's difficulties in creating a consumer-friendly product at a competitive price point. This adds to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro. However, the news isn't catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects.  The overall impact is likely to be small, with a slightly higher probability of a minor price decrease due to negative sentiment. The existing positive sentiment around Apple's overall performance and other product lines will likely mitigate any significant negative impact.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news.  Considering the overall strength of Apple and the relatively niche nature of the canceled project, a significant drop is unlikely. The fact that Apple is still investing in underlying AR technologies suggests that this is more of a setback than a complete abandonment of the AR market.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, but both probabilities are relatively close to 0.5, reflecting the uncertainty.  The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly more positive outlook, but the N107 cancellation introduces a countervailing negative factor."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The mixed signals from analysts regarding future sales and the cautious stance of Buffett indicate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but the potential for a price fall due to negative sales outlooks cannot be ignored. Considering the previous predictions, there is a general sentiment that Apple's stock might see a positive movement due to AI-related sales, but concerns about the limited rollout and other market factors keep the probabilities relatively balanced."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A significant portion of VGT's assets are concentrated in Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT). While the article acknowledges the long-term growth potential of AI and the tech sector, it raises concerns about the valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft and the strategic challenges faced by Apple. The article suggests that Apple's shift towards following AI trends rather than leading them could erode its premium market positioning. This, coupled with the concentration risk and potential overvaluation of key holdings, introduces uncertainty about VGT's ability to outperform the S&P 500 in 2025. The emergence of cost-effective AI models from Chinese companies also adds a layer of complexity. While the long-term potential of AI is acknowledged, the article suggests that VGT, and by extension Apple, may face headwinds in 2025. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, but the most recent ones lean towards a positive outlook. However, the specific concerns raised in this article about Apple's AI strategy and its impact on VGT's performance warrant a more cautious outlook. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price fall. The previous rounds of predictions show a slight trend towards a more positive outlook, but the current article presents a more nuanced and potentially negative perspective on Apple's near-term prospects."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple canceling its AR glasses project (N107) is predominantly negative, but its impact is likely to be muted due to several factors.  The cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's difficulties in creating a consumer-friendly AR product, adding to concerns following the Vision Pro's lukewarm reception. However, this is not a catastrophic event; Apple is still investing in AR/VR technologies and has other projects underway.  The news is likely to cause a temporary dip in investor confidence, but Apple's overall strong financial performance and diverse product portfolio will likely mitigate any significant long-term negative impact.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news.  Considering the overall strength of Apple and the relatively niche nature of the canceled project, a significant drop is unlikely. The fact that Apple is still investing in underlying AR technologies suggests that this is more of a setback than a complete abandonment of the AR market.  While the news is negative, the overall strength of Apple and the limited scope of the canceled project suggest a relatively small impact on the stock price. The probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a minor price decrease, but the overall impact is expected to be limited."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses the Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT) and its potential to outperform the S&P 500 in 2025. While the ETF has historically performed well, the article raises concerns about its concentration in Apple (AAPL), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT). Specifically, it points to Apple's strategic shift in AI, suggesting it's now following rather than leading, which could erode its premium market positioning. This, combined with potentially overvalued valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, introduces risk to the ETF's near-term performance. The emergence of cost-effective AI models from Chinese companies also adds a layer of complexity. The article suggests that VGT, and by extension Apple, may face headwinds in 2025. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, but the most recent ones lean towards a positive outlook. However, the specific concerns raised in this article about Apple's AI strategy and its impact on VGT's performance warrant a more cautious outlook. Therefore, I'm adjusting the probabilities to reflect a slightly higher chance of a price fall. The previous rounds of predictions show a slight trend towards a more positive outlook, but the current article presents a more nuanced and potentially negative perspective on Apple's near-term prospects. Given the negative signals about Apple's AI strategy and the potential impact on its market positioning, I believe the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The cancellation reflects challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's difficulties in creating a consumer-friendly, cost-effective AR product. This adds to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro. However, it's not a catastrophic event; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects underway.  The news is likely to cause a temporary dip in investor confidence, but Apple's overall strong financial performance and diverse product portfolio will likely mitigate any significant long-term negative impact.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news. Considering the overall strength of Apple and the relatively niche nature of the canceled project, a significant drop is unlikely. The fact that Apple is still investing in underlying AR technologies suggests that this is more of a setback than a complete abandonment of the AR market.  The probabilities reflect a slightly higher chance of a minor price decrease, but the overall impact is expected to be limited.  The consistent predictions leaning towards a slight increase in stock price, despite various news, suggest a strong underlying positive sentiment towards Apple that is likely to outweigh the negative impact of this specific news."

While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative due to the impact of DeepSeek on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. This could lead to cautious trading around Apple's stock, especially if the earnings report does not meet expectations.

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On one hand, a potential mismatch between hardware and software rollouts could weigh on iPhone sales, and the analyst expresses uncertainty about a significant upgrade cycle driven by AI. This suggests potential downside risk. On the other hand, Apple's hybrid CapEx model, allowing it to leverage other companies' AI investments, is seen as a positive, making it less vulnerable to competition like DeepSeek. The analyst maintains a 'Hold' rating, indicating a neutral stance. Considering these factors, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the concerns about iPhone sales and the lack of a clear AI-driven upgrade cycle, but the mitigated risk from AI competition prevents a strong bearish outlook."

(AAPL, Financial) experienced a positive premarket increase of 3.5% after its quarterly results led to an initial decline. The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business.

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's stock jumped 3.5% pre-market following the release of its quarterly earnings. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, the overall results exceeded analyst predictions, particularly in services revenue.  The positive outlook for the next quarter, suggesting continued strong iPhone demand, further boosted investor confidence.  The cautious approach to AI investments, while potentially limiting future growth in that sector, also appears to have been viewed positively by the market given recent volatility in the tech sector.  The combination of exceeding expectations in key areas, a positive outlook, and a relatively stable performance during recent market turbulence suggests a high probability of continued upward price movement in the short term. However, the slight miss on iPhone sales and the uncertainty surrounding future AI investments introduce some risk of a price correction.  Therefore, while the probability of a price rise is higher, the possibility of a fall cannot be entirely discounted."

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available.

                                    "reasoning": "The news surrounding DeepSeek has created a negative sentiment in the tech sector, leading to a sell-off that has affected major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall market environment is cautious due to concerns about competition from DeepSeek and the implications for AI investments. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with a slight lean towards a price fall due to the negative market sentiment. However, Apple's strong services revenue and a positive sales outlook for the next quarter could mitigate some of the bearish sentiment. Given these mixed signals, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

The previous round of predictions shows a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to positive earnings and outlook, while others are more cautious due to missed iPhone sales and competition. The most recent models seem to be more bearish. Considering the analyst's 'Hold' rating and the mixed signals, I'll slightly favor a price fall, but not drastically, as Apple's overall financial health and brand strength provide some support."

(AAPL, Financial) experienced a positive premarket increase of 3.5% after its quarterly results led to an initial decline. The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business.

The positive outlook for the next quarter further strengthens the positive sentiment. The 3.5% pre-market jump reflects this positive market reaction. Although there are concerns about AI investments and the slight miss on iPhone sales, the overall picture suggests a higher probability of a price rise in the short term.

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available.

While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall market environment is cautious due to concerns about competition from DeepSeek and implications for AI investments. However, Apple's strong services revenue and a positive sales outlook for the next quarter could mitigate some of the bearish sentiment. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a slight lean towards a price fall, but the potential for positive earnings results could also support a rise. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

While this is presented as a strength, the analyst's 'Hold' rating and uncertainty about a significant AI-driven upgrade cycle suggest limited upside potential. The previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning bullish due to strong earnings and outlook, while others are bearish due to missed iPhone sales and general tech sector concerns. The trend in predictions seems to be shifting slightly towards a more bearish outlook. Considering the analyst's neutral stance, the mixed earnings report, and the cautious market sentiment, I believe the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise."

The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business.

The positive outlook for the next quarter further strengthens this positive sentiment. The 3.5% pre-market jump reflects this positive market reaction. However, the slight miss on iPhone sales and cautious AI investment strategy introduce some uncertainty.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, reflecting the mixed signals in the news.  While some models highlight the negative market sentiment in the tech sector and concerns about competition, others focus on the positive aspects of Apple's results and future outlook. Considering the strong earnings beat, positive outlook, and the pre-market jump, the probability of a price rise is higher.  However, the inherent uncertainty in the market and the slight miss on iPhone sales prevent assigning an extremely high probability to a price rise.

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available.

While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall market environment is cautious due to concerns about competition from DeepSeek and implications for AI investments. However, Apple's strong services revenue and a positive sales outlook for the next quarter could mitigate some of the bearish sentiment. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a slight lean towards a price fall, but the potential for positive earnings results could also support a rise. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

The analyst's 'Hold' rating and uncertainty about a significant AI-driven upgrade cycle suggest limited upside potential. The previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning bullish due to strong earnings and outlook, while others are bearish due to missed iPhone sales and general tech sector concerns. The trend in predictions seems to be shifting slightly towards a more bearish outlook. Considering the analyst's neutral stance, the mixed earnings report, and the cautious market sentiment, I believe the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, the positive earnings and future outlook cannot be ignored, so the probability of a rise is still significant."

The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business.

The pre-market jump of 3.5% suggests immediate positive market reaction to the better-than-expected results.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's future performance, particularly concerning AI investments.

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available.

                                    "reasoning": "The news surrounding DeepSeek has created a negative sentiment in the tech sector, leading to a sell-off that has affected major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall market environment is cautious due to concerns about competition from DeepSeek and implications for AI investments. However, Apple's strong services revenue and a positive sales outlook for the next quarter could mitigate some of the bearish sentiment. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a slight lean towards a price fall, but the potential for positive earnings results could also support a rise. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a price fall than a rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

The analyst's 'Hold' rating and uncertainty about a significant AI-driven upgrade cycle suggest limited upside potential. Previous predictions are mixed, with some leaning bullish due to strong earnings and outlook, while others are bearish due to missed iPhone sales and general tech sector concerns. The trend in predictions seems to be shifting slightly towards a more bearish outlook. Considering the analyst's neutral stance, the mixed earnings report, and the cautious market sentiment, I believe the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise. However, the positive earnings and future outlook cannot be ignored, so the probability of a rise is still significant. Also, the previous rounds of predictions show that the models that don't have specific information about the company tend to predict a higher probability of stock price falling, which is not reliable."

(AAPL, Financial) experienced a positive premarket increase of 3.5% after its quarterly results led to an initial decline. The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business. The future performance of Apple will be closely tracked by market analysts regarding its AI developments.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While exceeding revenue and EPS expectations is positive, the slight miss on iPhone sales and cautious AI investment strategy introduce uncertainty.  The pre-market jump of 3.5% reflects immediate positive market sentiment, but this might not be sustained. The overall tech sector sentiment is also cautious due to concerns about AI competition.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  The positive earnings and outlook suggest a higher probability of a price rise, but the missed iPhone sales target and general market caution temper this optimism. Considering the mixed signals and the trend of previous predictions leaning slightly bearish, I assign a higher probability to a price rise, but not overwhelmingly so.  The consistent slight bearish lean in the previous predictions, despite the positive earnings report, suggests a lingering market concern that needs to be considered."

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

(AAPL, Financial) experienced a positive premarket increase of 3.5% after its quarterly results led to an initial decline. The firm predicts that its fiscal second-quarter sales will grow at a rate between single digits and mid-range single digits, indicating strengthening iPhone market demand. The released outlook proved better than analysts predicted, indicating positive trends for iPhone products.\n\nFor the period that ended on December 28, Apple generated $2.42 per share of earnings while achieving $124.3 billion in revenue, which surpassed the projected $2.36 per share of earnings and $124.12 billion in revenue. The company registered decreased iPhone sales totaling $69.14 billion, whereas they stood at $69.70 billion in the previous financial year and failed to reach analyst projections of $71.03 billion.\n\nThe services division of the company achieved a $26.34 billion year-over-year increase, which exceeded the forecasted $26.09 billion revenue during this period.\n\nApple approaches AI investments cautiously because they avoid substantial data center investment when compared to their industry peers. The stock did well to protect itself during the recent market volatility that hit big-tech companies.\n\niPhone sales numbers decreased slightly, yet the company anticipates positive future prospects while enjoying rising revenue streams from its services business. The future performance of Apple will be closely tracked by market analysts regarding its AI developments.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "Apple reported record revenue and EPS, exceeding expectations.  While this is overwhelmingly positive, several factors temper the bullish outlook.  The decline in Greater China revenue (attributed partly to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there) is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds a layer of caution.  Foreign exchange headwinds are anticipated to negatively impact the next quarter.  However, the strong performance in other regions, record iPhone upgrader numbers (boosted by Apple Intelligence in some markets), and the robust growth in emerging markets (especially India) suggest continued overall strength.  The record installed base and continued growth in services revenue are also very positive indicators.  Weighing the positives and negatives, a price rise is more likely, but the risks associated with China and currency fluctuations prevent a completely optimistic prediction."

                                    "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?",
                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

While Buffett's continued holding of AAPL is a positive signal, the article also highlights potential challenges, such as reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic headwinds. However, the reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price."

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows a mixed bag.  Record revenue and EPS are overwhelmingly positive, exceeding expectations and suggesting strong overall performance.  The significant growth in services revenue (14% YoY) is particularly encouraging, as it represents a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.  Record iPhone upgrader numbers and strong performance in emerging markets (especially India) further bolster the positive outlook.  However, several factors temper the enthusiasm. The 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, partly due to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds caution.  Anticipated foreign exchange headwinds will further impact the next quarter.  The previous predictions range from 0.55 to 0.75 probability of a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment. Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth in services, and the positive outlook in emerging markets, I lean towards a higher probability of a price rise. However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability.  The overall positive sentiment from exceeding expectations and strong service revenue is likely to outweigh the negative aspects in the short term, but the long-term impact of the China market challenges remains uncertain."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% increase in revenue and strong cash flow, which supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance to these concerns. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which generally leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and the current analysis, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall."

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2025 earnings significantly exceeded expectations, reporting record revenue and EPS.  The strong performance in services (14% YoY growth) is particularly noteworthy, as it represents a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.  Record iPhone upgrader numbers and robust growth in emerging markets (especially India) further contribute to a positive outlook. However, several factors temper the bullish sentiment.  The 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, attributed partly to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern.  The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds caution.  Anticipated foreign exchange headwinds will negatively impact the next quarter.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities (0.55 to 0.78) for a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment. Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth in services, and the positive outlook in emerging markets, I lean towards a higher probability of a price rise.  However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability. The pre-market jump of 3.4% also suggests a positive market reaction.  Balancing the positive and negative factors, and considering the consensus of previous predictions, a moderate probability of a price rise is most appropriate."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Apple Inc. (AAPL) in the context of Warren Buffett's investment strategy, highlighting its position as one of his longest-held stocks. This is a positive signal given Buffett's reputation as a value investor. The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% increase in revenue and robust cash flow, which supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance to these concerns. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which generally leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and the current analysis, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall."

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report presents a mixed picture.  Record revenue and EPS are undeniably positive, exceeding expectations and demonstrating strong overall performance.  The significant growth in services revenue (14% YoY) is particularly encouraging, representing a high-margin, recurring revenue stream.  Record iPhone upgrader numbers and robust growth in emerging markets (especially India) further bolster the positive outlook. However, the 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, partly due to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern. The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds caution. Anticipated foreign exchange headwinds will negatively impact the next quarter.  The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities (0.55 to 0.78) for a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment.  Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth in services, and the positive outlook in emerging markets, a price rise is more likely. However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability. The pre-market jump of 3.4% also suggests a positive market reaction.  The consensus of previous predictions centers around a 0.7 probability of a price rise.  Balancing the positive and negative factors, and considering the consensus, a probability slightly below the consensus is appropriate to account for the lingering uncertainties."

                                    "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?",
                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company reported a 6% increase in revenue, strong cash flow, and a Buy rating from BofA, all supporting a positive outlook. However, concerns about reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges temper the enthusiasm. Previous predictions from various models generally leaned towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.75. The overall sentiment is positive, but with caution due to slower AI rollout and Chinese market decline."

GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Signs with FINW.\n\nRelease Date: January 30, 2025\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nPositive Points\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an all-time high revenue of $124.3 billion for the December quarter, marking a 4% increase year over year. The company achieved all-time revenue records across multiple regions, including the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific, with strong momentum in emerging markets. Services revenue reached an all-time record of $26.3 billion, growing 14% year over year, with significant growth in both developed and emerging markets. Apple's installed base of active devices reached a new record of over 2.35 billion, driven by high customer satisfaction and loyalty. The introduction of Apple Intelligence features has been well-received, contributing to stronger iPhone sales in markets where it is available.\n\nNegative Points\n\nGreater China revenue declined by 11% year over year, with over half of the decline attributed to changes in channel inventory. Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue decreased by 2% year over year, facing challenges compared to the previous year's product launches. Foreign exchange headwinds are expected to negatively impact revenue by about 2.5 percentage points in the upcoming quarter. The company faces competitive pressures in China, where Apple Intelligence has not yet been rolled out, affecting iPhone replacement cycles. Operating expenses increased by 7% year over year, reaching $15.4 billion, which may impact future profitability if not managed effectively.\n\nQ & A Highlights\n\nQ: Tim, can you elaborate on how Apple Intelligence is impacting iPhone demand and which features are most popular? A: We observed stronger year-over-year performance for the iPhone 16 family in markets where Apple Intelligence was available. Popular features include writing tools, Image Playground, Genmoji, and visual intelligence. Clean Up is also well-received, especially in-store demos.\n\nStory Continues\n\nQ: Can you discuss the challenges Apple faces in China, particularly regarding iPhone sales? A: Greater China revenue was down 11% year-over-year, with over half of the decline due to changes in channel inventory. Apple Intelligence has not been rolled out in China, which affects performance. The market remains highly competitive, and recent fiscal stimulus could impact future results.\n\nQ: How does Apple view the potential for innovation in iPhone form factors in the future? A: We believe there is significant room for innovation in smartphones, and we are optimistic about our product pipeline. We expect continued advancements in form factors and features.\n\nQ: What is driving the strong upgrade cycle for iPhones, and has Apple Intelligence played a role? A: We set an all-time record for iPhone upgraders, with compelling reasons to upgrade. The iPhone 16 outperformed the 15 from launch to the end of the December quarter, and Apple Intelligence contributed to stronger performance in markets where it was available.\n\nQ: Can you comment on the sustainability of growth in emerging markets and their potential to offset China headwinds? A: We see robust growth in emerging markets, particularly in India, which set a December quarter record. The iPhone was the top-selling model in India, and we are expanding our retail presence there. Emerging markets offer significant upside potential.\n\nFor the complete transcript of the earnings call, please refer to the full earnings call transcript.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2025 earnings report shows a mixed bag.  Record revenue and EPS are overwhelmingly positive, exceeding expectations and suggesting strong overall performance.  The significant growth in services revenue (14% YoY) is particularly encouraging, as it represents a high-margin, recurring revenue stream. Record iPhone upgrader numbers and strong performance in emerging markets (especially India) further bolster the positive outlook. However, several factors temper the enthusiasm. The 11% YoY decline in Greater China revenue, partly due to inventory adjustments but also competitive pressures and the lack of Apple Intelligence rollout there, is a significant concern. The slight dip in Wearables, Home, and Accessories revenue also adds caution. Anticipated foreign exchange headwinds will further impact the next quarter.  The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities (0.55 to 0.78) for a price rise, reflecting this mixed sentiment.  Considering the overall strong financial performance, the growth in services, and the positive outlook in emerging markets, a price rise is more likely. However, the significant challenges in China and the potential impact of foreign exchange headwinds prevent assigning an extremely high probability. The pre-market jump of 3.4% also suggests a positive market reaction.  The consensus of previous predictions centers around a 0.7 probability of a price rise.  Balancing the positive and negative factors, and considering the consensus and the overall trend of the predictions, a probability of 0.72 for a price rise and 0.28 for a price fall seems appropriate."

                                    "headline": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?",
                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The article also mentions Apple's strong financial performance, including a 6% increase in revenue and robust cash flow, which supports a positive outlook. However, there are concerns about reduced iPhone sales projections and macroeconomic challenges, which could temper investor enthusiasm. The reiteration of a Buy rating by BofA, citing margin resiliency and strong cash flow, provides a counterbalance to these concerns. Overall, the mixed signals suggest a neutral to slightly positive impact on the stock price. Considering the previous predictions, which generally leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price rise, and the current analysis, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall."

Additionally, services revenue was up 14%. However, revenue from China was down 11%, and the rollout of AI services has been slower than expected. Despite this, the company expects growth in the March quarter and 'low double digits' growth for its Services division. The premarket increase of 3.4% in Apple's stock price suggests a positive reaction to the earnings report.

                                    "content": "Investing.com - Shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) were higher in premarket U.S. trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available. And while it is still being rolled out slower than initially anticipated, new regions will have their hands on Apple Intelligence soon, along with new features for existing users,\" Luria wrote.\n\n(Yasin Ebrahim contributed reporting.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple shares rise as rosy sales outlook suggests iPhone demand momentum\n\nStory Continues\n\nSCA Q4 sales rise 17%, boosted by higher prices and increased volumes\n\nBofA's Hartnett says US exceptionalism is 'peaking'\n\nView Comments",

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This aligns with the broader trend of AI driving growth in the tech sector, as evidenced by the significant market gains in AI-linked stocks. However, the immediate financial impact of AI on Apple's revenue appears limited, as the iPhone 16 series did not see a significant sales boost despite AI features. The overall positive sentiment around AI and Apple's strong financial performance (record revenue of $94.9 billion) suggests a likely positive market reaction, though the lack of immediate AI-driven sales growth may temper enthusiasm. The broader context of AI's transformative potential and Apple's positioning as a leader in consumer electronics with a focus on privacy supports a moderate probability of a stock price rise."

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, a 6% increase from the previous year, underscores its strong financial performance. However, the immediate financial impact of AI features on iPhone sales appears limited, as the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant boost. This mixed signal\u2014strong financials and AI integration versus muted immediate AI-driven sales growth\u2014suggests a balanced outlook. Additionally, the broader context of AI's transformative potential and Apple's leadership in consumer electronics supports a moderate probability of a stock price rise, while the lack of immediate AI-driven sales growth may temper enthusiasm. Considering the previous predictions, which range from cautious optimism to slight pessimism, a balanced probability assessment is appropriate."

Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "reasoning": "The news highlights Apple Inc.'s strategic integration of AI into its devices with a focus on personal privacy, which aligns with the broader positive trend in the tech sector driven by AI advancements. Apple's record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, a 6% increase from the previous year, underscores its strong financial performance. However, the immediate financial impact of AI features on iPhone sales appears limited, as the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant boost. This mixed signal\u2014strong financials and AI integration versus muted immediate AI-driven sales growth\u2014suggests a balanced outlook. Additionally, the broader context of AI's transformative potential and Apple's leadership in consumer electronics supports a moderate probability of a stock price rise, while the lack of immediate AI-driven sales growth may temper enthusiasm. Considering the previous predictions, which range from cautious optimism to slight pessimism, a balanced probability assessment is appropriate."

The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\nFor the three months ended December 28, Apple reported earnings of $2.42 per share on revenue of $124.3 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com had anticipated EPS of $2.36 on revenue of $124.12 billion.\n\nHowever, iPhone sales, which account for nearly half of total revenue, fell to $69.14 billion from $69.70 billion a year earlier, short of estimates of $71.03 billion.\n\nApple's services unit, which includes its Apple Pay and App Store offerings, increased by around 14% year-on-year to $26.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $26.09 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, in the latest sign that competition in China's smartphone market remains intense, Apple's sales in Greater China were down 11% to $18.5 billion, well below analyst projections of $21.57 billion.\n\nIn a note to clients, analysts at DA Davidson led by Gil Luria called Apple's first-quarter results \"mixed\", with \"positive notes in various segments [being] slightly overshadowed by some negatives, primarily out of Greater China\".\n\n\"That being said, Apple Intelligence is clearly benefiting iPhone growth in regions/countries where it is available.

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 earnings were mixed. While exceeding revenue and EPS expectations is positive, the shortfall in iPhone sales and significant decline in Greater China revenue are concerning. The positive Q2 sales guidance, however, is a key bullish factor, suggesting continued iPhone demand momentum despite current challenges. The successful integration of Apple Intelligence, albeit slower than anticipated, is also a positive sign for future growth. The cautious approach to AI seems to have shielded Apple from the recent Big Tech downturn. The pre-market rise reflects positive market sentiment.  Considering the previous predictions, which show a wide range of opinions, and the mixed nature of the results, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for negative impacts from China and iPhone sales to materialize later.  The consensus leans towards a slight increase in stock price due to the positive Q2 outlook, but the uncertainty surrounding China sales and the full impact of Apple Intelligence warrants a cautious approach. The previous predictions show a wide range, highlighting the uncertainty inherent in predicting short-term stock movements. My assessment incorporates this uncertainty while giving slightly more weight to the positive Q2 guidance and the pre-market reaction.  The overall trend in predictions shows a slight increase in the probability of a price rise over the rounds, suggesting a growing confidence in the positive outlook despite the mixed Q1 results."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

On one hand, the general tech sell-off triggered by DeepSeek and Microsoft's Azure growth concerns create a negative sentiment. The scrutiny on AI spending and DeepSeek's competitive AI model could also negatively impact investor confidence in Apple's AI strategy. On the other hand, the article mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction to those earnings will likely be the biggest driver of short-term price movement. Meta's positive earnings, driven by AI investments, could create a positive halo effect, but this is less likely given the concerns about DeepSeek. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general negative sentiment in the tech sector, I believe there's a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall than a rise."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news of Apple canceling its augmented reality glasses project (N107) is generally negative for Apple's stock. While the Vision Pro remains a product in their lineup, the cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space.  The failure of N107, following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro, suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this technology.  This could lead to investor concern about Apple's future growth prospects in a potentially lucrative but challenging market. However, the news is not entirely catastrophic. Apple is still investing in AR/VR technology and has other projects underway.  The stock price reaction will likely be muted, with a slight downward pressure due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but not a significant crash given Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio. The impact is likely to be less severe than if this were Apple's primary focus area."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news highlights several challenges for Apple, particularly its strategic shift towards following AI trends rather than leading them, which could undermine its premium market position. The concentration risk in the Vanguard Information Technology ETF, where Apple is a major holding, raises concerns about the ETF's performance in 2025. Additionally, the elevated valuations of key competitors like Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's recent strategic decisions, suggest a more cautious outlook. While there are some positive aspects, such as Apple's strong financials and potential long-term growth in AI, the immediate sentiment appears more negative. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

However, Meta's positive earnings driven by AI investments offer a potential positive counterforce.

The DeepSeek situation introduces uncertainty about AI competition and national security concerns, potentially impacting investor sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the importance of the upcoming earnings report, I lean slightly towards a negative outlook, but the earnings could easily swing the sentiment. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with a slight trend towards negative sentiment in the later rounds. Given the uncertainty and the potential negative impact of the DeepSeek situation, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple canceling its AR glasses project (N107) is predominantly negative, but the impact is likely to be muted due to Apple's overall strong financial position and diverse product portfolio.  The cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product in this space, adding to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro.  This suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this specific technology. However, the news isn't catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects underway.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact of this news.  While some models highlight the negative aspects (e.g.,  failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification as mitigating factors. Considering the mixed signals and the fact that this is one project among many, a significant stock price movement in either direction is less likely.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher due to the negative sentiment surrounding the cancellation, but the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company reported a 6% revenue increase in the September 2024 quarter, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to perceived risks and valuation concerns, while others see potential in Apple's strong brand and financials. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the uncertainty around AI's immediate impact tempers the optimism."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration. These figures were sourced from the Insider Monkey Database.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Among Warren Buffett\u2019s Longest-Held Stocks?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money.

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product, adding to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro.  This suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this specific technology. However, it's not catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects underway.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact. Some models highlight negative aspects (failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), while others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification.  The fact that this is one project among many suggests a significant stock price movement in either direction is unlikely.  Considering the mixed signals and the relatively small scale of this setback compared to Apple's overall business, a slight downward pressure is more probable than a significant rise. The previous rounds show a trend towards a slightly negative outlook, which I'm incorporating into my prediction.  However, the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news highlights Apple's integration of AI into its devices with a focus on personal privacy, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors. The company reported a 6% revenue increase in the September 2024 quarter, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to perceived risks and valuation concerns, while others see potential in Apple's strong brand and financials. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the uncertainty around AI's immediate impact tempers the optimism."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that certain AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Despite the challenges, the overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic due to the positive forecast and the strong financial performance, including record revenue and profit. The recent rounds of predictions from various models also indicate a mix of sentiments, but with a slight trend towards a positive outlook."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The previous rounds show a trend towards negative sentiment, likely due to the uncertainty surrounding AI competition and Apple's strategic positioning.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The cancellation highlights challenges in the AR/VR market and Apple's struggles to create a consumer-friendly product, adding to concerns following the lukewarm reception of the Vision Pro. This suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this specific technology. However, it's not catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects underway.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact. Some models highlight negative aspects (failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), while others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification. The fact that this is one project among many suggests a significant stock price movement in either direction is unlikely. Considering the mixed signals and the relatively small scale of this setback compared to Apple's overall business, a slight downward pressure is more probable than a significant rise. The consistent trend across multiple prediction rounds leans towards a slightly negative outlook, which I'm incorporating into my prediction. However, the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term.  The fact that this is a relatively niche product failure within a larger, successful company mitigates the negative impact."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "reasoning": "The news highlights Apple's strategic move to integrate AI into its devices with a focus on personal privacy, which could appeal to privacy-conscious consumers and tech investors. The company reported a 6% revenue increase in the September 2024 quarter, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty. Previous predictions from other models show a mixed sentiment, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to perceived risks and valuation concerns, while others see potential in Apple's strong brand and financials. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than falling, but the uncertainty around AI's immediate impact tempers the optimism."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money.

Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The previous rounds show a trend towards negative sentiment, likely due to the uncertainty surrounding AI competition and Apple's strategic positioning.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

This suggests difficulties in innovation and market entry for this specific technology. However, it's not catastrophic; Apple is still investing in AR/VR and has other projects underway. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the long-term impact. Some models highlight negative aspects (failure to compete with Meta, internal morale issues), while others point to Apple's overall strength and diversification. The fact that this is one project among many suggests a significant stock price movement in either direction is unlikely. Considering the mixed signals and the relatively small scale of this setback compared to Apple's overall business, a slight downward pressure is more probable than a significant rise.  The consistent trend across multiple prediction rounds leans towards a slightly negative outlook. However, the overall impact is likely to be relatively small in the short term. The fact that this is a relatively niche product failure within a larger, successful company mitigates the negative impact.  The overall trend in predictions shows a slight bias towards a price fall, but the magnitude of the predicted fall is consistently small.  I'm weighting this information heavily, as the repeated predictions suggest a consensus view."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The company reported a 6% revenue increase in the September 2024 quarter, driven by new product launches, though the immediate impact of AI on sales is unclear. The broader context of AI's growing influence across industries and the tech sector's strong performance suggests a positive outlook for AI-adopting companies. However, concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI and the lack of a significant sales boost from the iPhone 16 series introduce some uncertainty.

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Warren Buffett\u2019s 10 Longest-Held Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.\n\n\u2018The Oracle of Omaha\u2019\n\nKnown as the Oracle of Omaha, Warren Buffett will undoubtedly go down as one of the greatest and most prosperous value investors in history. During the booming stock market of the 1960s, the billionaire investor used his investment partnership to purchase Berkshire Hathaway, a struggling textile company in New England, which now stands as a global titan.\n\nBuffett has often underlined the need to fully know the internal operations of a company before making any investments. His strategy focuses on finding companies with strong, scalable models that are ready for expansion and market leadership, as well as those that have much to gain from a subsequent increase in stock value. Both investors and market analysts have frequently praised this methodical, long-term investment strategy, particularly in light of Berkshire becoming one of the most recent non-tech companies to reach a $1 trillion market capitalization.\n\nHowever, despite a generally strong market performance for much of 2024, Buffett appears to have shifted towards a more defensive stance. As interest rates climbed and economic conditions weakened, Buffett significantly reduced his holdings in companies experiencing rapid valuation increases. By late 2024, Berkshire had amassed over $325 billion in cash and cash equivalents, predominantly held in U.S. Treasury bills. This suggested that Berkshire avoided making major investments in popular stocks, even during periods of market optimism. That said, Warren Buffett\u2019s decision to hoard cash might not be a random one. In fact, it mirrors strategies he has used in the past during previous financial downturns. As an example, the billionaire adopted a somewhat similar approach at the onset of the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s and again in the lead-up to the 2007-2008 financial crisis. In both these instances, Buffett foresaw market turbulence and positioned Berkshire to navigate the challenges by maintaining substantial liquidity.\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s Stance on Cryptocurrency\n\nWarren Buffett has repeatedly stated that he is not a fan of cryptocurrency. During Berkshire\u2019s 2018 annual shareholder meeting, Buffett called Bitcoin \u201cprobably rat poison squared.\u201d In Berkshire\u2019s 2022 shareholder meeting, the billionaire once again stated:\n\n\u201cIf you told me you own all of the Bitcoin in the world and you offered it to me for $25, I wouldn\u2019t take it because what would I do with it? I\u2019d have to sell it back to you one way or another. It isn\u2019t going to do anything.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nRecent reports, however, indicate that the Oracle of Omaha seems to be softening his stance on cryptocurrencies. Berkshire has invested in Nu Holdings, a digital banking company based in Brazil that supports the cryptocurrency market and operates its own platform. In a 2021 Series G funding round, Buffett\u2019s company contributed $500 million, followed by another $250 million. Nubank Crypto, Nu\u2019s cryptocurrency platform, was launched in 2022 and supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Polygon. Berkshire\u2019s stake in Nu increased from 0.1% in the fourth quarter of 2022 to 0.4% in the third quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo create our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks, we analyzed his Q3 2024 investment portfolio and selected stocks that he has consistently held for the longest duration.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nWarren Buffett\u2019s First Major Purchase: 2016\n\nBerkshire Hathaway\u2019s stake in Q3 2024: $69.9 billion\n\nFew people are unfamiliar with the name Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), the technology giant renowned for its flagship devices, such as the iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch, as well as its diverse suite of services, such as iCloud and Apple Music. Given the 2.2 billion Apple devices in the world, the company has a significant platform from which to introduce its AI services.\n\nBofA analysts predict that strong initial demand for the iPhone 16 will drive Apple\u2019s fiscal Q1 2025 results on January 30. However, due to fewer iPhone shipments, they expect a lower March quarter guidance. The bank predicts that iPhone sales will fall to 49 million units in the March quarter, less than the street consensus of 52 million and lower than their previous estimate of 56 million. Macroeconomic challenges and the delayed release of Apple Intelligence features, which analysts claim are \u201cyet to gain widespread adoption,\u201d are to blame. BofA reduced its iPhone sales projections for fiscal 2025 and 2026 from 239 million and 257 million units to 229 million and 246 million units, respectively. Despite this, the firm reiterates its Buy rating for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), citing \u201cmargin resiliency, tailwinds to gross margin, and strong cash flow.\u201d\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported $94.9 billion in revenue for the fourth quarter of 2024, representing a 6% increase over the same period the previous year. Product revenue increased from $67 billion to nearly $70 billion in 2023. The company also reported $27 billion in operating cash flow and paid out $29 billion in dividends.\n\nGreenlight Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cWe continue to be concerned about the overall valuation of the market and have maintained a lower-than-average net market exposure. In fact, our daily correlation to the S&P 500 last year was 0.01. Cyclically and interest rate adjusted valuations are as high as we can remember.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 9th on our list of Warren Buffett\u2019s longest-held stocks.

The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate.

One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news of Apple scrapping its Mac-connected AR glasses project is a significant negative signal, indicating potential issues with innovation in the AR/VR space. This is compounded by internal issues within the Vision Products Group, suggesting a lack of focus and clear direction. While Apple is still working on other AR/VR projects, the cancellation raises concerns about their ability to compete effectively, especially given Meta's progress. The previous rounds show a trend towards negative sentiment as the specific news about the AR project cancellation outweighs general market optimism. Therefore, I believe the probability of a stock price fall is higher than a rise. The fact that Apple has canceled other projects recently (self-driving car, Apple Watch screens) further reinforces this negative sentiment. The Vision Pro's slow start and lack of consumer appeal also contribute to the negative outlook."

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. has canceled a project to build advanced augmented reality glasses that would pair with its devices, marking the latest setback in its effort to create a headset that appeals to typical consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Manhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll Historic London Elevator Faces Last Stop in Labour\u2019s Housing Push Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo\n\nThe company shuttered the program this week, according to people with knowledge of the move. The now-canceled product would have looked like normal glasses but include built-in displays and require a connection to a Mac, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the work wasn\u2019t public. An Apple representative declined to comment.\n\nThe project had been seen as a potential way forward after the weak introduction of the Apple Vision Pro, a $3,499 model that was too cumbersome and pricey to catch on with consumers. The hope was to produce something that everyday users could embrace, but finding the right technology \u2014 at the right cost \u2014 has proven to be a challenge.\n\nApple risks losing ground to Meta Platforms Inc., which already sells a popular set of Ray-Ban smart glasses. Meta is working to create a version that adds augmented reality \u2014 the superimposing of images and data on real-world views \u2014 and expects to have a product ready by 2027. That\u2019s when Apple had previously intended to sell its device-connected glasses, which were code-named N107.\n\nThe decision to wind down work on the N107 product followed an attempt to revamp the design, according to the people. The company had initially wanted the glasses to pair with an iPhone, but it ran into problems over how much processing power the handset could provide. It also affected the iPhone\u2019s battery life. So the company shifted to an approach that required linking up with a Mac computer, which has faster processors and bigger batteries.\n\nBut the Mac-connected product performed poorly during reviews with executives, and the desired features continued to change. Members of Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, which worked on the device, grew increasingly concerned that the project was on the rocks. Sure enough, the final word came this week that the effort was over.\n\nThe glasses are the latest example of Apple giving up on a once-promising technology. Last year, the company axed its decadelong effort to build a self-driving car. It also canceled work on custom Apple Watch screens in 2024.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe Vision Pro remains a technical marvel, even with its slow start. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook touted the product during an earnings conference call Thursday, saying that more corporate customers are embracing it.\n\nBut employees in Apple\u2019s Vision Products Group, or VPG, believe there\u2019s a lack of focus and clear direction within the team, which is overseen by executive Mike Rockwell and company hardware chief John Ternus. The N107 retreat is just the latest failed attempt to make Apple\u2019s headset technology successful, they say, and that\u2019s hurting morale.\n\nThe company is still working on successors to the Vision Pro, including updated versions of the original model. It also has other concepts in the works, such as AirPods with cameras, and executives still hope to eventually create a set of standalone AR glasses someday.\n\nApple has made other recent changes. Last week, one of the Vision Pro team\u2019s top executives moved to the AI division.\n\nThe N107 device had advanced projectors that could display information, images and video in the field of view for each eye, similar to augmented reality glasses being developed by Meta and others. Despite the project being shuttered, Apple is still working on underlying technologies that could be used in AR glasses down the road, including custom microLED-type screens, Bloomberg News reported this week.\n\nThe holy grail for the industry is creating fully standalone glasses \u2014 with their own screens, processor and operating system \u2014 that wouldn\u2019t require a smartphone or computer. Last year, Meta previewed prototype glasses called Orion that come close to this design, though they do connect to a wireless puck that handles the computing. Meta expects developers to start buying test units in 2026, helping them create software for the device. The launch of a consumer version \u2014 code-named Artemis \u2014 is planned for 2027.\n\nThe canceled Apple device also would have been similar to devices such as Xreal Inc.\u2019s One spectacles and Lenovo Group Ltd.\u2019s ThinkReality. The Vision Pro, in contrast, is a mixed-reality headset. It melds virtual reality with a version of AR that relies on cameras to show the outside world \u2014 rather than just letting users peer through glass at the real thing.\n\nWith its AR glasses project, Apple had hoped to capitalize on one of the more compelling features of visionOS, the operating system that runs on the Vision Pro. It can link up with a Mac and let people handle computing tasks in mixed reality. That means the Vision Pro can serve as a giant, virtual monitor that feels like it curves around a user.\n\nPrototypes of the device were light enough to not require a strap to wrap around a wearer\u2019s head \u2014 a requirement of the heavier Vision Pro. Apple also removed the front-facing screen on today\u2019s Vision Pro that shows a wearer\u2019s eyes. Though that technology is one of the more memorable aspects of the current headset, the feature adds cost and weight.\n\nBut the device did still have some bells and whistles: The company worked on including lenses that could change their tint depending on what a user is doing. The idea was to tell an onlooker if the person is present and approachable \u2014 or busy working on computing tasks.\n\nThe N107 decision marks at least the second time Apple has walked away from an AR project. Around two years ago, it shelved its first effort, a project code-named N421. Apple had originally aimed to bring those glasses to market around a year after the initial Vision Pro. Apple canceled N421, in part, to focus on a new mixed-reality headset code-named N109, which has been discussed as a cheaper variant of the Vision Pro\u2019s VR-based design.\n\nCompany executives were originally compelled by the N107 idea because of past success with devices like the Apple Watch and AirPods, which serve as accessories to its main products. In recent years, Apple\u2019s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment has eclipsed its Mac and iPad divisions in revenue.\n\nThe failure of the N107 glasses leaves Apple with one fewer avenue for finding a new hit product. So far, the Vision Pro doesn\u2019t have mass consumer appeal.\n\nWithin Apple, the Vision Pro\u2019s slow sales were initially blamed on its hefty price tag \u2014 roughly seven times the level of Meta\u2019s Quest 3 headset. But there\u2019s been another, more troubling development: People who already own the device aren\u2019t using it as much as the company had anticipated.\n\nThat puts Apple in a quandary. Even if it can make a headset cheaper and lighter, it still has to figure out how to make the product resonate with consumers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have transformed the investing landscape since their 1993 debut, attracting investors with their straightforward approach to diversification. By allowing individuals to buy shares that track entire market indexes or sectors, ETFs eliminate the challenge and risk of selecting individual stocks while keeping costs minimal.\n\nThe technology sector particularly exemplifies the power of ETF investing in the years following the 2008 financial crisis. As digital innovation has fundamentally altered how we communicate, work, and live -- from the rise of social media to the recent breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) -- tech-focused ETFs have delivered exceptional returns since the financial crisis while providing investors broad exposure to this transformative industry.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT) has been a particularly potent investing vehicle since its 2004 debut, turning the digital revolution into market-beating gains. Beyond consistent market outperformance, the fund's rock-bottom expense ratio of 0.10% maximizes investor returns, compared to the industry average of 0.93%.\n\nThe fund's stellar performance in 2024 reinforces its winning strategy. While the S&P 500 posted an exceptional 25% total return (including dividends), the Vanguard Information Technology ETF delivered an even more remarkable 29.3% gain to shareholders.VGT Total Return Level data by YCharts.\n\nCan this popular Vanguard tech ETF outperform yet again in 2025? Let's dig deeper to find out.\n\nMarket outlook\n\nAt the start of the year, Wall Street's consensus projected a roughly 10% total return (including dividends) for the benchmark S&P 500. While a lot has transpired since these projections were made -- Trump has taken office, DeepSeek shook the AI world -- this 10% figure gives us a benchmark to gauge the attractiveness of the Vanguard Information Technology ETF in 2025.\n\nHistorically, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF has averaged a total annual return of 13.7% since its inception 21 years ago. That figure implies the fund should beat out the S&P 500 again in 2025, but a deeper look suggests this year may not be typical for the ETF from a performance standpoint.\n\nPortfolio composition and valuation concerns\n\nAn analysis of the fund's portfolio structure reveals why its historical performance trajectory may shift in the coming year. The fund maintains significant concentration risk, with 45% of its assets allocated to three technology leaders: Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile analysts project robust double-digit revenue growth for both Nvidia and Microsoft in 2025, their current valuations -- with forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/Es) above 30 -- suggest much of this anticipated growth is already reflected in their stock prices.\n\nApple presents additional concerns heading into 2025. The company's recent decision to integrate ChatGPT through an OpenAI partnership across its operating systems marks a departure from its traditional innovation leadership. This strategic pivot toward following rather than setting AI trends could potentially erode Apple's premium market positioning.\n\nGiven these factors -- the elevated valuations of Nvidia and Microsoft, combined with Apple's strategic challenges -- the fund's largest holdings may struggle to deliver the market-beating returns investors have come to expect. This concentration in potentially overvalued assets introduces meaningful risk to the fund's near-term performance outlook.\n\nGrowth catalysts and market dynamics\n\nThe emergence of DeepSeek's cost-effective AI models has sparked debate about the massive AI investments planned by U.S. technology leaders. While these companies continue to commit trillions to AI development, DeepSeek's breakthrough raises questions about the necessity of such extensive capital deployment.\n\nThis development marks a pivotal moment in AI's evolution. Chinese companies have demonstrated their abilities to create capable chatbots without relying on the most advanced semiconductor technology.\n\nHowever, pursuing artificial general intelligence (AGI) still depends heavily on specialized AI processors, a market where Nvidia maintains clear technological leadership. This dynamic creates an intriguing tension between emerging cost-efficient approaches and the continued value of cutting-edge hardware infrastructure.\n\nWhile the U.S. pursuit of AGI should continue driving robust revenue growth for Microsoft and Nvidia, the accelerating pace of Chinese AI development introduces new strategic and competitive risks. This evolving landscape suggests that even market leaders must navigate an increasingly complex technological and geopolitical environment.\n\nInvestment outlook\n\nThe Vanguard Information Technology ETF enters 2025 in unfamiliar territory. Unlike its consistent market-beating performance since the 2008 financial crisis, the fund now faces unique challenges. The AI landscape has grown more complex, with Chinese developments like DeepSeek demonstrating that competitive language models can be built without cutting-edge semiconductor technology.\n\nWhile DeepSeek may ultimately prove less capable than the sophisticated models from Anthropic, Alphabet, and OpenAI -- and the pursuit of AGI will likely continue to require Nvidia's advanced AI processors -- the broader investment thesis has shifted. For the first time in over fifteen years, this widely held Vanguard fund no longer presents the compelling case for outperformance that investors have come to expect.\n\nThis uncertainty doesn't necessarily signal underperformance but suggests a more nuanced risk-reward profile that investors should carefully evaluate against their portfolio objectives.\n\nTaking the long view\n\nWhile the Vanguard Information Technology ETF may face near-term headwinds in 2025, its long-term growth potential remains compelling. Artificial intelligence represents a genuine technological revolution, rather than a passing trend, with its transformative effects already visible across industries and societies.\n\nThe economic impact of AI is expected to be profound, with projections suggesting it could generate trillions in global economic value by 2030. This fundamental shift in the technological landscape makes the Vanguard Information Technology ETF an attractive long-term investment opportunity, even as it navigates temporary uncertainties. The fund's exposure to key players in the AI revolution positions it well to capture substantial value creation over the next decade and beyond.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

While the company's Q4 earnings and revenue showed growth, and the market reacted favorably (though perhaps more out of relief than excitement), there are significant concerns. The primary negative factor is the increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, which disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's ongoing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated."

                                    "reasoning": "The news piece presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies,  he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This is primarily due to concerns about a potential mismatch in hardware and software rollouts impacting iPhone sales and uncertainty regarding an AI-driven upgrade cycle.  The analyst's cautious stance and lack of bullish sentiment suggest a relatively low probability of a significant price increase. The absence of overwhelmingly positive news counterbalances the potential positive impact of Apple's less vulnerable position regarding DeepSeek. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than the probability of a price rise, although neither is overwhelmingly likely based solely on this news."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

However, the analyst's Hold rating and concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle and AI boom suggest that the news may not have a significant immediate impact on the stock price. Additionally, the fact that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure model makes the company less vulnerable to the emergence of DeepSeek is a positive factor. Overall, the news seems to be neutral to slightly positive, but the analyst's cautious stance and the lack of clear evidence of a super-cycle or upgrade cycle from AI suggest that the probability of a significant stock price rise is relatively low."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

The increasing competition and slowing iPhone demand in China, coupled with the potential for tariffs, disproportionately affects Apple compared to its Mag 7 peers. The news also mentions Apple's continuing AI struggles. The broader tech sector's positive earnings growth and revisions trend are supportive, but the specific challenges in China weigh heavily on the stock's near-term prospects. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a slight downward trend in the probability of the stock rising. Given these factors, a slight downward pressure is anticipated."

This indicates a lack of strong bullish sentiment. Concerns remain about the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise to a high probability of a price fall.  The overall sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise, but the lack of strong positive catalysts and the analyst's cautious outlook suggest that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low. Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, a neutral stance is most appropriate, with slightly higher probability assigned to a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations)."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The market's reaction seems cautiously optimistic, but underlying issues could weigh on sentiment.

The content indicates that while there is some positive sentiment from the DeepSeek news, it is not yet driving a significant rush to upgrade iPhones. This mixed outlook, with both positive and negative factors, leads to a cautious stance. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, with some models indicating a higher likelihood of a stock price rise (e.g., 0.75, 0.65, 0.6) and others a higher likelihood of a fall (e.g., 0.6, 0.45).

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While the analyst highlights Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending as a positive in the face of the DeepSeek impact on other Big Tech companies, he maintains a Hold rating on the stock. This indicates a lack of strong bullish sentiment. Concerns remain about the iPhone upgrade cycle and the impact of a mismatch in hardware and software rollouts.  The previous predictions are varied, ranging from a high probability of a price rise (0.75) to a high probability of a price fall (0.6).  However, there's a clear trend towards a more neutral stance in the second round of predictions. The overall sentiment leans slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise due to the positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations), but the lack of strong positive catalysts and the analyst's cautious outlook suggest that the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is relatively low.  Considering the mixed signals and the convergence of previous predictions towards a more neutral assessment, a probability slightly favoring a rise reflects the balance of positive and negative factors."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

China sales remain a significant concern.  Previous predictions show a convergence towards a neutral stance, with probabilities for a price rise and fall clustering around 0.5.  Considering the balanced nature of the news and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative catalysts, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, reflecting the positive earnings report and the company's relatively resilient position regarding DeepSeek.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "DeekSeek appears to have put a big dent in what everyone believed was a source of competitive advantage in the AI race for Tech leaders like Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, and others. And if we go by how Microsoft and Meta described the evolving AI competitive landscape on their respective Q4 earnings calls last week, we will most likely hear comparable commentary from Amazon and Alphabet as they come out with their December-quarter results this week.\n\nMarket participants have all along been skeptical of the investment case for the extraordinarily heavy spending by Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and others on AI-centric data centers and related infrastructure. The issue all along has been these companies\u2019 inability to articulate a clear case for how these investments will get monetized.\n\nWhile a lot about DeepSeek\u2019s actual cost in building and training its model is unknown, notwithstanding the announced figure of a few million dollars, the hundreds of billions of dollars that these companies are collectively pouring into the project appears to be overkill. Microsoft and Meta reiterated their spending plans and see the resulting data center capacity as giving them a strategic advantage in the long run. We can safely assume that Amazon and Alphabet will follow Microsoft and Meta on this crucial question.\n\nWhile the market\u2019s collective focus was mainly on the AI question for Microsoft and Meta, the former disappointed in its core results, with cloud guidance coming up short, while the latter showed plenty of operating momentum in operating results. Microsoft\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +10.2% from the same period last year on +12.3% higher revenues, while Meta\u2019s earnings and revenues increased +48.7% and +20.6% from the year-earlier levels, respectively.\n\nApple and Tesla, the other Mag 7 players that also reported results last week, received favorable market reception. However, the positive market follow-through was likely less of a response to the core results and more of a sigh of relief at better-than-feared numbers.\n\nChina has emerged as a major risk in the Apple story, with tepid iPhone demand in that key market and the company\u2019s continuing AI struggles taking center stage. Some anecdotal evidence suggests that some of Apple\u2019s local Chinese competitors are giving it a lot tougher competition than in years past. On top of that is the prospect of tariffs, a far bigger issue for Apple than the rest of its Mag 7 peers.\n\nApple\u2019s December-quarter earnings were up +7.1% on +4% higher revenues, while Tesla\u2019s earnings and revenues for the period were up +15.7% and +2.1% from the year-earlier level, respectively. Net margins were up at Apple and Tesla, with Apple\u2019s margins up 86 basis points from the same period last year while Tesla\u2019s expanded 105 bps.\n\n\u7e7c\u7e8c\u95b1\u8b80\n\nTake a look at the chart below that shows current consensus expectations for the \u2018Mag 7\u2019 stocks as a whole for the current and coming periods in the context of what they were able to achieve in the preceding period.

Apple's AI struggles are also a factor. The positive aspects highlighted in the news (less vulnerability to DeepSeek and exceeding revenue expectations) are balanced by the China risk. The trend in previous predictions shows a convergence towards a more neutral outlook. Therefore, I am slightly decreasing the probability of a rise and increasing the probability of a fall compared to the previous round. I am also taking into account the fact that the market has already priced in some of the positive news, and that the negative news is likely to have a greater impact on the stock price in the short term."

While the company exceeded revenue expectations and its hybrid CapEx model offers some protection against the DeepSeek impact on other tech giants, significant concerns remain. The analyst's 'Hold' rating reflects uncertainty about an AI-driven upgrade cycle and potential iPhone sales headwinds due to mismatched hardware and software rollouts. China sales remain a significant concern.  Previous predictions show a convergence towards a neutral stance, with probabilities for a price rise and fall clustering around 0.5.  Considering the balanced nature of the news and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative catalysts, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, reflecting the positive earnings report and the company's relatively resilient position regarding DeepSeek. However, the persistent concerns regarding iPhone sales and the broader economic climate (implied by the mention of potential tariffs and general market volatility) warrant caution. The consistent trend towards a neutral prediction across multiple models and rounds reinforces the assessment of a relatively balanced probability distribution."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. gave a reassuring revenue forecast for the current quarter, helping boost shares of the world\u2019s most valuable company after its holiday results showed jarring declines for China and the iPhone.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nManhattan\u2019s Morning Commute Time Drops With New Congestion Toll How the 2025 Catholic Jubilee Is Reshaping Rome Trump Paves the Way to Deputize Local Police on Immigration Housing Aid Uncertain After Trump\u2019s Spending Freeze Memo Trump's Federal Funding Pause Threatens State Financials\n\nSales will grow by a percentage in the low- to mid-single digits, the company said during a conference call Thursday. Though that\u2019s in line with the roughly 5% that analysts have been predicting, it was enough to soothe the nerves of investors following a mixed quarterly report.\n\nThe shares climbed more than 3% in late trading, rebounding from a decrease. They had dropped 5.1% this year through the close, part of a broader tech stock decline.\n\nRevenue from China plunged 11% to $18.5 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 28, Apple said earlier. Analysts had anticipated a gain to $21.6 billion. Sales of the iPhone, meanwhile, dropped less than 1% to $69.1 billion. Wall Street projected $71 billion.\n\nThe results renewed concerns about China, one of Apple\u2019s biggest markets, where it\u2019s struggled to fend off competition from local brands. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said that more than half of the decline in China stemmed from inventory issues.\n\n\u201cOur channel inventory reduced from the beginning of the quarter to the end of the quarter,\u201d he said during the conference call. \u201cOur sales were a bit higher than we forecasted them to be toward the end of the quarter. And so we ended a little leaner than we had expected to.\u201d\n\nThe poor performance for overall iPhone sales suggested that the company didn\u2019t get much of a lift from the rollout of a new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. Still, the new iPhone 16 performed better in countries where the AI features were available, Cook said.\n\nApple is playing catch-up with its biggest tech peers in AI. A staggered rollout of Apple Intelligence also has meant that consumers have had to wait for many features. And competitors have jumped out ahead in other areas, such as smart glasses. Apple\u2019s wearables business declined over the holidays as well.\n\n\u201cApple needs to accelerate its Apple Intelligence deployment and be a bit more aggressive in emerging areas like smart glasses development to maintain an innovative edge,\u201d Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne said in a note. \u201cThe next few quarters will test whether it can balance its cautious approach with the market\u2019s hunger for AI innovation.\u201d\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe report also marks a changing of the guard for Apple. It\u2019s the first to be announced under new Chief Financial Officer Kevan Parekh, who replaced longtime CFO Luca Maestri at the beginning of this year.\n\nTotal revenue rose 4% to $124.3 billion in the period, helped by growth in services revenue. Analysts had projected $124.1 billion on average. Profit rose to $2.40 a share, beating the average estimate of $2.35. Like the revenue figure, that number was a record high.\n\nThe latest iPhones aren\u2019t markedly different than the prior models \u2014 a factor that may have led some consumers to hold off on upgrades. Though the company has touted the Apple Intelligence platform as a reason to buy the device, its earlier iPhone 15 Pro models can also run the software.\n\nApple is planning a larger iPhone refresh this year, including a replacement for its low-end SE model in the coming months and a thinner iPhone in the fall.\n\nThe services division, which includes the App Store and Apple Music, was a bright spot, bringing in an all-time record of $26.3 billion and growing 14%. Wall Street had been looking for $26.1 billion. Services revenue in the second quarter will climb in the low-single digits, Apple said during the call.\n\nThe Mac and iPad lineups also performed better than expected. The Mac generated sales of $8.99 billion in the quarter, beating estimates of $7.94 billion.\n\nApple updated several models with AI-focused M4 chips last year, and it plans to roll out a new MacBook Air soon. It\u2019s also expected to unveil desktop computers later in the year.\n\nRevenue from the iPad grew 15% to $8.09 billion, compared with an estimate of $7.35 billion. After taking a break in 2023 from launching new models, the company revamped the iPad Pro and iPad Air last May and refreshed the iPad mini in the fall. Cook said the new Air and lower-end models were mainly responsible for the revenue increase. The company is planning to update the low-end and Air models in the coming months.\n\nThe company\u2019s wearables, home and accessories category, which has struggled in recent quarters, posted revenue of about $11.8 billion. That was down slightly from a year earlier and below the projection of nearly $12 billion.\n\nThe company released a redesigned Apple Watch Series 10 and rolled out two new AirPods models last year, but its latest product category \u2014 the Vision Pro headset \u2014 hasn\u2019t been a sales driver. Parekh said the lack of a new Ultra watch in 2024 created a tough comparison for that segment.\n\nMore broadly, Cupertino, California-based Apple still faces plenty of challenges at home and internationally.\n\nIts struggles in China have stemmed in part from not being able to offer Apple Intelligence in the country. That\u2019s made it harder to compete with local brands like Huawei Technologies Co. Apple is working to find an AI partner that will let it launch the AI platform in China.\n\nIn the EU, where Apple\u2019s AI won\u2019t be offered to customers until April, the company is facing continued scrutiny over the dominance of its App Store. The company is under threat of fines if it doesn\u2019t concede to regulators and change policies, including those related to subscription payments, that could weigh on its services results.\n\nLocally, the company is bracing for the possibility of new tariffs during the second Trump administration. President Donald Trump has discussed imposing the levies on goods imported into the US from China and elsewhere. Right now, Apple makes the majority of its processors in Taiwan via partner Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., while most of its devices are assembled in China.\n\nAsked about the possibility of tariffs, Cook said Apple is \u201cmonitoring the situation.\u201d\n\nThe company\u2019s biggest hurdle may be in artificial intelligence, where it remains behind many of its tech peers. Apple Intelligence \u2014 introduced in stages over a period of months \u2014 has suffered from bugs, including inaccurate news summaries. And the homegrown features pale in comparison with offerings from OpenAI, Google Gemini and the emerging DeepSeek.\n\nCook praised DeepSeek during the call, but said that Apple\u2019s approach would still give it an advantage.\n\n\u201cInnovation that drives efficiency is a good thing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd, that\u2019s what you see in that model. Our tight integration of silicon and software, I think, will continue to serve us very well.\u201d\n\n(Updates with further remarks from call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans The Internet Almost Killed Barnes & Noble, Then Saved It What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

Forte explains that Apple's hybrid capital expenditure (CapEx) model makes the company less vulnerable.\n\n\"They spend some money themselves but are also able to leverage other's CapEx spending,\" Forte says. \"They're not ramping into CapEx nearly as heavily as Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), or others, so DeepSeek is less of a threat to Apple.\" Related Videos\n\n47:40\n\nTech earnings, HPE-Juniper Networks deal, tariffs: Catalysts\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 8 hours ago 05:53\n\nApple earnings: 3 reasons this analyst remains 'concerned'\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 yesterday 03:09\n\nApple downgraded by Oppenheimer just ahead of earnings\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 2 days ago 03:44\n\nWhy DeepSeek could bring 'opportunities to monetize' software\n\nYahoo Finance Video \u2022 3 days ago\n\nTo watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Catalystshere.\n\nThis post was written by Naomi Buchanan.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple, with both positive and negative factors. On the positive side, Apple's less aggressive CapEx spending and its ability to leverage other companies' AI spending make it less vulnerable to the emergence of DeepSeek. Additionally, the company's strong performance in services, Mac, and iPad segments, and its record revenue and profit are bullish signals. However, concerns about the iPhone upgrade cycle, AI competitiveness, and significant declines in China sales weigh on the stock's prospects. Considering the previous predictions from various models, there is a range of opinions on the stock price movement. Most models agree that the news is neutral to slightly positive, with a moderate probability of the stock price rising. Given the mixed signals and the overall neutral to slightly positive tone of the news, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures pointed higher on Friday, with investors pouring through fresh tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and a raft of tech earnings, including iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Meanwhile, a key gauge of inflation that is closely followed by the Federal Reserve is scheduled to be released, with markets trying to determine the possible path ahead for central bank's monetary policy this year.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures inched higher on Friday, as traders assessed renewed tariff threats from U.S. President Donald Trump and parsed through a batch of earnings from major technology companies.\n\nBy 03:39 ET (08:39 GMT), the Dow futures contract had ticked up by 88 points or 0.2%, S&P futures had risen by 23 points or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 155 points or 0.7%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street climbed in the prior session despite equities paring back some earlier gains following fresh tariff comments from U.S. President Donald Trump (more below). An upbeat outlook from electric vehicle giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) helped to offset software titan Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) disappointing guidance for its all-important cloud computing unit.\n\nInvestors were also mulling over statements from executives at Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) about the emergence of a low-cost artificial intelligence model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek, which roiled global stock markets earlier this week.\n\n2. Trump's fresh tariff threats\n\nTrump has told reporters he would follow through on an earlier threat to slap 25% import tariffs on Canada and Mexico on February 1, arguing that the move was designed to stem the flows of illegal migrants and fentanyl into the U.S.\n\nHe also suggested that he was still planning to place additional levies on China, although he did not provide more details.\n\nIn a later post on Truth Social, Trump warned members of the so-called BRICS group of countries -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- that they could face 100% duties if they attempt to replace the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency, reiterating a prior threat made in late November.\n\nMarkets have been on edge in recent days as Trump weighs his tariff options.\n\nAlthough he has so far opted not to impose universal levies since his return to the White House, he has threatened actions against specific economies. Some economists have flagged that the tariffs could refuel inflationary pressures in the U.S. and spark a broader trade war -- increasing uncertainty for both businesses and investors.\n\nStory Continues\n\n3. Apple's iPhone outlook\n\nShares in Apple were higher in extended hours trading, rebounding from an initial dip following the iPhone maker's latest quarterly results.\n\nExecutives at the company said the group now expects sales to grow in the low- to mid-single digits in its fiscal second quarter. The guidance surpassed expectations and pointed to momentum in demand for the iPhone, Reuters reported, citing analysts.\n\nThe rosier outlook helped to assuage some worries around sales for Apple's flagship handset, which dropped marginally and missed estimates in its key holiday shopping quarter, due in part to the firm's new AI features not being available in some markets. Still, CEO Tim Cook said the enhancements, known as Apple Intelligence, are boosting sales.\n\nApple has taken a more cautious approach to AI compared to its Silicon Valley peers, choosing not to spend heavily on building out data centers. The strategy seemed to help insulate the stock during the DeepSeek-inspired market turmoil earlier this week, which led to steep drops in other Big Tech shares.\n\n4. PCE ahead\n\nThe release of the December personal consumption expenditures price index is due to highlight the economic calendar on Friday.\n\nEconomists predict the inflation metric will come in at an annualized pace of 2.6% and 0.3% month-on-month, both faster than previous readings of 2.4% and 0.1%.\n\nThe \"core\" measure, meanwhile, is seen at 2.8% year-on-year, matching November's rate, and edging up to 0.2% from 0.1% on a monthly basis.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Reserve will likely be assessing the figures as they attempt to gauge the future path of inflation in the world's largest economy. On Wednesday, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% and signaled that they would take a wait-and-see attitude to potentially slashing borrowing costs this year, with officials noting lingering uncertainties around the broader economic outlook.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly losses; gold near record peak\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were set for weekly losses as traders fretted over the prospect of trade tariffs under President Trump.\n\nBy 03:40 ET, the US crude futures (WTI) gained 0.2% to $72.88 a barrel, while the Brent contract rose 0.1% to $75.99 a barrel.\n\nFor the week, Brent is set to fall 1.6% while WTI has declined 1.8%. However, for the month of January, Brent is set to gain around 3%, its best month since June, and WTI is poised to climb 2.1%.\n\nElsewhere, gold prices hovered around a record peak as investors eyed Trump's tariff comments and cautiously awaited the upcoming U.S. inflation report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Trump's tariff threats, Apple earnings - what's moving markets\n\nEuro zone consumers, forecasters see higher inflation despite ECB optimism\n\nGerman unemployment rate rises with economic malaise\n\nView Comments",

The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed, with some models predicting a rise and others a fall.

On one hand, there's general concern about the rise of Chinese AI, particularly DeepSeek, which has caused market volatility and scrutiny of Big Tech's AI investments. This could negatively impact investor sentiment towards Apple, especially if its AI strategy is perceived as lagging. The fact that Nvidia had to address its tumbling stock due to DeepSeek's advance suggests a real competitive threat. However, the article also mentions that Apple's earnings are coming up, and the market's reaction will depend on those results. Meta's positive reaction to its earnings beat, driven by AI investments, suggests that strong earnings and a clear AI strategy could boost Apple's stock. The overall market sentiment seems cautious due to DeepSeek, but a strong earnings report from Apple could offset this concern. Given the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report and the general market unease, I'm assigning a slightly lower probability of a rise than a fall."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article highlights the overall positive sentiment surrounding AI and its impact on the tech sector, with Apple (AAPL) positioned as a significant player.  However, the article also notes that Apple's recent integration of AI into its products, while generating record revenue, hasn't resulted in a significant sales boost for the iPhone 16.  This suggests that the market's immediate reaction to Apple's AI initiatives might be muted.  The article's ranking of AAPL as only 6th on Coatue's list of most important AI stocks further tempers expectations of a dramatic price surge. While the long-term prospects for Apple in the AI space are positive, the short-term impact of this specific news is likely to be less pronounced. The overall market sentiment towards AI is bullish, which could provide some support to AAPL, but the lack of immediate, substantial financial gains from Apple's AI integration suggests a more moderate price movement."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money.

One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings.

While Apple is set to report earnings, the overall sentiment in the tech sector is negative, particularly after the impact on major players like Nvidia and Microsoft. Although there are mixed signals regarding Apple's upcoming earnings, the prevailing market sentiment is cautious, suggesting a higher probability of a price decline. However, if Apple's earnings report exceeds expectations, there could be a positive reaction. Given the current environment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "reasoning": "The news is mixed. While the overall AI market sentiment is bullish, and Apple is integrating AI into its products, the impact on Apple's recent product sales hasn't been dramatic.  Apple's ranking as only 6th on Coatue's list of important AI stocks suggests that the market doesn't view Apple as a leading AI innovator at this time.  The record revenue is positive, but the lack of a significant sales boost from AI features introduces uncertainty.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to the overall positive AI sentiment and Apple's strong financial performance, while others predict a fall due to concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for the market to be overestimating the impact of AI.  I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the overall positive market sentiment and Apple's strong financial position, but the lack of a clear AI-driven sales boost tempers this optimism.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding Apple's stock movement based on this news alone."

However, the limited rollout of these features has also had a negative impact. Considering the overall positive impact of AI on sales, it's likely that the stock price will rise. Analyzing the previous predictions, there is a trend of increasing optimism towards Apple's stock, with some models assigning a high probability of the stock price rising due to positive earnings and strong growth projections. Given the positive news and the trend of increasing optimism, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into?

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Additionally, the disputes and uncertainties surrounding the Stargate initiative add to the negative sentiment.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news is mixed. While the overall AI market sentiment is positive and Apple is integrating AI, the impact on recent product sales hasn't been dramatic.  Apple's ranking 6th on Coatue's list of important AI stocks suggests it's not seen as a leading AI innovator. Record revenue is positive, but the lack of a significant AI-driven sales boost introduces uncertainty.  Previous predictions show a wide range, highlighting uncertainty.  The positive overall AI market sentiment and Apple's strong financial position suggest a potential price rise, but the lack of a clear AI sales boost tempers this.  The concern about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for overestimation of AI's impact are counterpoints. Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, with a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to the lack of a clear AI-driven sales boost and the cautious sentiment in the market regarding Apple's AI strategy."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. The rise of DeepSeek and its impact on the tech industry, coupled with Microsoft's Azure growth disappointment, creates a negative backdrop. However, Meta's positive earnings driven by AI investments offer a counterpoint. The article specifically mentions Apple's upcoming earnings, making them a crucial factor. Considering the previous predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to the overall positive AI sentiment and Apple's strong financial performance, while others predict a fall due to concerns about Apple's AI strategy and the potential for the market to be overestimating the impact of AI. Given the mixed signals and the importance of the upcoming earnings report, I am assigning a slightly higher probability of a price fall, but a strong earnings report could easily reverse this. The trend in previous predictions shows a slight shift towards a more negative outlook, but the earnings report remains a key determinant."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management.

(AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "reasoning": "The news is mixed. While the overall AI market is bullish and Apple is integrating AI, the impact on recent product sales hasn't been dramatic. Apple's ranking 6th on Coatue's list of important AI stocks suggests it's not a leading AI innovator.  Record revenue is positive, but the lack of a significant AI-driven sales boost introduces uncertainty.  Previous predictions show a wide range, highlighting uncertainty. The positive overall AI market sentiment and Apple's strong financial position suggest a potential price rise, but the lack of a clear AI sales boost and concerns about Apple's AI strategy temper this. The emergence of DeepSeek adds competitive pressure.  Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, a slightly higher probability of a price fall is assigned, reflecting the lack of a clear AI-driven sales boost and the cautious sentiment in the market regarding Apple's AI strategy compared to other AI players. The previous predictions show a trend towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall in later rounds."

The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman.

He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases.

(AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

These factors contribute to negative sentiment towards the company's future growth prospects, particularly in AI. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a cautious market sentiment, with some optimistic views based on earnings and AI integration, while others are more pessimistic due to competition and market dynamics. The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious, but the upcoming earnings report will be a critical factor."

The market's reaction will largely depend on these earnings results, which could either mitigate or exacerbate the negative sentiment. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some leaning towards a price rise due to strong sales forecasts and AI integration, while others highlight potential declines due to market volatility and competition. Given the cautious sentiment in the tech sector and the uncertainty surrounding the earnings report, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of Coatue\u2019s 35 Most Important AI Stocks. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against Coatue\u2019s other most important AI stocks.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has fueled a major rally in the technology sector, driving up key market indices. Over the past year, the S&P 500, heavily influenced by tech giants, has risen by nearly 22%, while the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite has surged over 26%. Initially, market analysts had predicted an increase in interest around growth options for 2024 due to easing inflation and potential rate cuts. However, AI has taken this expected interest and amplified it into an economy-wide wave of optimism. While tech stocks have been the primary beneficiaries, AI\u2019s influence is expanding across industries such as manufacturing, supply chain, transportation, entertainment, and retail.\n\nInvestment in AI is growing rapidly across various sectors. A recent Goldman Sachs report estimates that global businesses will invest nearly $1 trillion in AI infrastructure over the next few years. Venture capital (VC) investments in AI startups are also on the rise. In the first half of 2024 alone, VC firms made approximately 200 AI-related deals, injecting nearly $22 billion into the sector. The average AI startup funding round now exceeds $100 million, with company valuations averaging over $1 billion. In contrast, non-AI startups typically receive around $20 million in funding and have valuations near $200 million, indicating AI\u2019s outsized appeal to investors.\n\nCompanies that were early adopters of AI have experienced significant gains, particularly those specializing in graphics processing units (GPUs), AI chips, and generative AI technologies. The median returns of AI-linked firms in the S&P 500 stand at 20%, compared to just 2% for non-AI stocks. AI companies are also responsible for 90% of the total returns on the NASDAQ Composite Index. These gains are expected to drive earnings growth and contribute to broader economic expansion. According to Joseph Briggs, a senior global economist at Goldman Sachs, AI is projected to automate 25% of all work tasks in the next decade, increasing US productivity by 9% and boosting GDP growth by more than 6%.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management argues that AI could be the start of a new \u201csuper cycle\u201d in the tech industry. Previous cycles included the rise of personal computers in the 1980s, networking in the 1990s, wired internet in the 2000s, and mobile internet in the 2010s, leading to the cloud era. However, software and internet experts Kash Rangan and Eric Sheridan highlight a key difference: this time, companies are linking AI investments directly to revenue generation, providing a financial safety net that was absent in past cycles.\n\nStory Continues\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT by OpenAI in early 2023, the industry\u2019s focus has shifted from software to AI hardware and infrastructure. AI infrastructure companies have collectively added nearly $6 trillion to their market capitalization since Q1 2023. Before large-scale AI automation becomes commonplace\u2014MIT economist Daron Acemoglu estimates this will take more than a decade\u2014AI infrastructure is expanding into areas such as utilities, energy, internet, and industrials. Interestingly, companies in these sectors that support AI development have posted returns rivaling those of traditional AI firms.\n\nThe growing demand for AI-driven data centers is also driving investments in the energy and utilities sectors. Goldman Sachs analysts Carly Davenport and Alberto Gandolf expect AI adoption to drive a surge in electricity demand not seen in decades. However, whether AI\u2019s growth will align with energy infrastructure investments remains uncertain due to regulatory constraints and supply chain limitations in the utilities sector. Even if necessary investments materialize, their full benefits may take years to reach AI companies.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nSome investors remain cautious, fearing an AI bubble similar to the dot-com crash of the early 2000s. However, current data suggests that AI valuations are far more grounded than those of the dot-com era. At the height of the dot-com bubble, software firms traded at price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 132x, compared to a five-year average of 37x in 1999. In contrast, in 2023, even the biggest AI stocks had P/E ratios around 39x, with a five-year average of 40x. These figures suggest that AI valuations are not overinflated, reinforcing investor confidence in AI\u2019s long-term potential.\n\nAI companies are increasingly targeting multi-trillion-dollar valuations, comparable to today\u2019s largest software and internet firms. Over the past decade, tech giants have scaled their businesses to unprecedented levels, combining billions of users, hundreds of billions in revenue, and tens of billions in net income. Today, a handful of firms account for 80% of the valuation of the Fortune 500. These companies dominate industries such as smartphones, e-commerce, cloud computing, and software-as-a-service (SaaS), all of which AI is poised to disrupt. As a result, these firms are aggressively incorporating AI into their business strategies to maintain market leadership.\n\nSome investors worry that AI firms could overshadow software companies, impacting long-term valuations. The price-to-sales (P/S) ratio for software stocks, which peaked in 2021, is now at an all-time low. Slower earnings growth has also contributed to negative sentiment in the sector. Coatue\u2019s research shows that over the next twelve months, only 1% of SaaS companies expect 30% earnings growth, down from 30% during the SaaS boom. However, as human-machine interaction shifts towards natural language processing and generative AI, software companies that successfully integrate AI into their platforms are likely to thrive.\n\nAs inflation cools, rate hikes ease, and prospects for a soft economic landing improve, AI\u2019s macroeconomic outlook remains strong. AI is now the primary driver of future earnings growth in the S&P 500. According to Coatue\u2019s projections, AI-linked stocks are expected to grow at a compound annual rate of nearly 20% over the next three years, outperforming non-AI stocks by approximately 14%. Additionally, 40% of future tech sector earnings are expected to be fueled by AI advancements. All available data points to a bright future for AI investments, with its influence extending far beyond traditional tech firms. As companies continue integrating AI into their operations, productivity and economic growth are set to accelerate, making AI one of the most transformative forces in modern history.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by Coatue Management. These stocks are also popular among other hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL): Integrating AI in Devices for Personal Privacy\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In October 2024, the company launched Apple Intelligence, a personal AI system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac, designed to assist users in writing, expressing themselves, and completing tasks efficiently. This system emphasizes user privacy by processing data on-device, ensuring personal information remains secure. Financially, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a record revenue of $94.9 billion in the September 2024 quarter, marking a 6% increase from the previous year. CEO Tim Cook attributed this growth to the introduction of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Despite the introduction of AI features, the iPhone 16 series did not experience a significant sales boost, leading to concerns about the immediate financial benefits of AI.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Coatue\u2019s most important AI stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter time frame.

                                    "reasoning": "The news is mixed. While Apple reported record revenue and is integrating AI into its devices, the impact on iPhone 16 sales has been less than expected.  The article ranks Apple 6th on a list of important AI stocks, suggesting it's not viewed as a leading AI innovator.  This contrasts with the overall bullish sentiment surrounding AI and its impact on the tech sector.  The previous predictions show significant disagreement, ranging from a 30% to an 85% probability of a price rise.  The uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy, the competitive threat from DeepSeek, and the overall market sentiment contribute to the mixed outlook.  Considering the lack of a significant immediate boost from AI integration, the cautious market sentiment, and the divergence in previous predictions, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price fall than a rise."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other AI stocks on latest news and ratings.\n\nElon Musk recently sparked skepticism in the AI community by claiming that companies funding the Stargate initiative lack the funds to do so. The Stargate initiative is a $500 billion artificial intelligence project recently announced by President Donald Trump. The project aims to build new AI data centers in the US.\n\nThree prominent figures in the initiative are SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son who will handle the financing, CEO Sam Altman of OpenAI who will be contributing his overall AI expertise, and Oracle executive chairman Larry Ellison who will oversee the buildout. All three joined President Trump on January 21 when he made the Stargate announcement.\n\nREAD NOW: 10 AI Stocks Making Waves on Wall Streetand\u00a010 AI Stocks to Watch Amid the DeepSeek Buzz\n\nMusk has claimed that this initiative doesn\u2019t have the necessary funding in place, which in turn sparked a dispute between him and Sam Altman. Altman has refuted Musk\u2019s claim, asserting that the funding is in place and that the work has already started. Larry Ellison, in particular, has noted that 10 data centers, each 500,000 square feet, are already under construction in Abilene, Texas, and that 10 more are in the pipeline.\n\nMusk is currently leading Trump\u2019s new government efficiency advisory board, DOGE. He also shares a tense relationship with Altman and is engaged in an ongoing lawsuit with OpenAI. In response to Musk\u2019s claims, Trump answered questions from reporters at the White House, dismissing the criticism. Trump was asked if Musk\u2019s criticism of the deal was a bother to him.\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t. He hates one of the people in the deal,\u201d Trump said of Musk. \u201cPeople in the deal are very, very smart people. But, Elon, one of the people he happens to hate. I have certain hatreds of people, too\u201d.\n\nRegarding the claims regarding the insufficient funding, Trump said that he doesn\u2019t know but he hopes that they do.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if they do, but you know, they\u2019re putting up the money. The government\u2019s not putting up anything, they\u2019re putting up money. They\u2019re very rich people, so I hope they do\u201d.\n\nA Trump adviser also wondered whether the public dispute may imply an end for Trump and Musk.\n\n\u201cThe end may be in sight,\u201d the adviser said.\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by going through news articles, stock analysis, and press releases. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Apple Inc. (AAPL) Is Struggling to Innovate in AI\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a technology company that has recently launched Apple Intelligence, its intelligence system. One of the biggest analyst calls on Wednesday, January 29, was for Apple Inc. Oppenheimer downgraded the stock to \u201cPerform\u201d from \u201cOutperform\u201d and removed its $250 price target on the stock. The ratings, issued ahead of its earnings on January 29, quoted a \u201cweaker outlook\u201d for iPhone sales in the next 12 to 18 months, a lack of AI innovation, and challenges in the Chinese market. The analyst also expects a slower-than-expected iPhone replacement cycle heading into fiscal 2026. In this period, he sees just 2% shipment growth. The analyst noted the gradual rollout of Apple Intelligence, Apple\u2019s lack of generative AI apps for consumers, and the advancements in capabilities from other AI models to cause this slow growth. Due to these reasons, the analyst believes it will be difficult for Apple to outperform.\n\n\u201cWe see little upside to Apple\u2019s valuation and believe it is hard to justify its premium multiple with slower iPhone growth and Apple\u2019s uncertain role in the early stages of gen AI adoption among consumers\u201d.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of AI stocks on latest news and ratings. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news highlights Apple's struggle to innovate in AI and a recent downgrade from Oppenheimer. These factors contribute to negative sentiment towards the company's future growth prospects, particularly in AI. The mixed signals from previous predictions suggest a cautious market sentiment, with some optimistic views based on earnings and AI integration, while others are more pessimistic due to competition and market dynamics. The overall market sentiment appears to be cautious, but the upcoming earnings report will be a critical factor."
