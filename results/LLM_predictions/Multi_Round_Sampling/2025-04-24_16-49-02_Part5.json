While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market factors."

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline.

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be small.  The event itself is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or affect the company's overall financial performance.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a slight increase in stock price due to other factors like AI investments and TSMC's positive outlook. However, this specific news is unlikely to be a major driver of stock price movement. Therefore, I assign a probability slightly above 0.5 for a price rise, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but acknowledging the limited impact of this single event. The probability of a price fall is correspondingly low."

Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

This suggests potential for favorable policies or reduced regulatory pressures, which could benefit Apple. However, the broader context includes past tensions between Trump and tech leaders, introducing some uncertainty. Given Apple's strong market position and the strategic importance of government relations, the overall sentiment is likely positive, but not overwhelmingly so. Previous predictions also lean towards a moderate positive impact, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a stock price rise. Considering these factors, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall."

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple opening a new store in Hefei, China is positive but relatively minor.  While it demonstrates continued expansion in a key market, the impact on Apple's overall stock price is likely to be small. The event is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or affect the company's overall financial performance in a substantial way.  The previous predictions show a range of probabilities, mostly leaning towards a slight increase in stock price due to other factors (AI investments, TSMC's outlook, etc.). However, this specific news is unlikely to be a major driver of stock price movement on its own.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is only slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, reflecting the generally positive but limited impact of this single event.  The probabilities are adjusted slightly downward compared to the previous rounds' average, reflecting the relatively small scale of the news compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price."

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

This suggests potential for favorable policies or reduced regulatory pressures, which could benefit Apple. However, the broader context includes past tensions between Trump and tech leaders, introducing some uncertainty. Given Apple's strong market position and the strategic importance of government relations, the overall sentiment is likely positive, but not overwhelmingly so. Previous predictions also lean towards a moderate positive impact, with probabilities ranging from 0.55 to 0.7 for a stock price rise.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion.

The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro headset and Apple Intelligence is concerning, but not necessarily a death knell.  The potential for further tariffs adds uncertainty.  Weighing these factors, the negative news is substantial enough to suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong given Apple's overall market position.

While Apple recaptured the top spot in Q4 2024, its annual shipments fell by 17%, dropping to third place behind Vivo and Huawei. The decline in shipments, especially the 25% drop in Q4, indicates significant competitive pressure from domestic players like Huawei, which saw a 24% YoY growth in Q4 and 37% for the full year. The US-China tensions and patriotic rallying around Huawei further exacerbate Apple's challenges. However, Apple's efforts to enhance retail experiences, offer discounts, and expand financing options may mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, the negative aspects (declining market share, competitive pressure) outweigh the positive (Q4 market leadership, strategic adjustments), suggesting a higher probability of a stock price fall."

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

The significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) is a major negative, exacerbated by Huawei's strong growth and the potential for further government subsidies to fuel competition.  The credit card partner transition adds uncertainty and potential disruption.  While Apple maintains its global dominance and boasts a strong ecosystem and brand loyalty, these factors are being challenged.  The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence further dampens the outlook.  The potential for Trump-era tariffs adds another layer of uncertainty.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise due to the potential positive aspects of the credit card partnership and Apple's overall strength, while others predict a fall due to the significant sales decline in China and other challenges. Considering the weight of negative news, particularly the substantial drop in Chinese sales, and the uncertainty surrounding the credit card partnership and potential tariffs, the probability of a price fall is higher than a price rise in the short term.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo.

Lukewarm reception of new products (Vision Pro, Apple Intelligence) further dampens the outlook.  Potential tariffs add uncertainty.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS).

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023.

The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales.

The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo.

Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

(AAPL) as TSMC is the main chipmaker for Apple. TSMC's strong performance has buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle, which could drive growth for Apple. Additionally, TSMC's projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure are ahead of analysts' estimates, indicating a positive trend. However, the article also mentions uncertainties stemming from the US-China tech conflict, which could potentially disrupt supply chains and impact Apple's sales. Considering the positive outlook from TSMC and the potential for growth in AI spending, as well as the trend of others' predictions which show a mix of positive and negative sentiments, the overall analysis suggests a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising."

                                    "content": "Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news highlights a decline in Apple's smartphone shipments in China, particularly in 2024, where they slipped to third place behind Vivo and Huawei. This decline is accompanied by increased competition from domestic players and ongoing US-China tensions, both of which present significant headwinds. While Apple managed to recapture the top spot in the fourth quarter and is implementing strategies like discounts and improved retail experiences to mitigate the impact, the overall tone of the news suggests a challenging environment for the company. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a majority leaning towards a lower stock price due to the competitive pressures and declining market share."

                                    "headline": "Why the tech industry is cozying up to Trump the second time around",
                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The emphasis on personalized service, 'Today at Apple' sessions, and special Chinese New Year promotions further enhances the positive outlook. However, the impact of a single store opening on a company as large as Apple is likely to be marginal. Therefore, while the news is positive, it's unlikely to cause a significant surge in the stock price. The probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

                                    "headline": "How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't",
                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok and its users, rather than Apple's financials. Apple's role in the situation is limited to removing the app from its store and ceasing updates, which is a regulatory compliance issue rather than a financial one. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising or falling due to this news is relatively low."

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok and its users, rather than Apple's financials. Apple's role in the situation is limited to removing the app from its store and ceasing updates, which is a regulatory compliance issue rather than a financial one.

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok and its users, rather than Apple's financials. Apple's role in the situation is limited to removing the app from its store and ceasing updates, which is a regulatory compliance issue rather than a financial one. Considering the previous predictions and the fact that the news is more related to TikTok than Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news should be relatively low and close to each other. The news does not provide any significant positive or negative information about Apple's financials or operations, so the stock price movement is likely to be minimal."

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok and its users, rather than Apple's financials. Apple's role in the situation is limited to removing the app from its store and ceasing updates, which is a regulatory compliance issue rather than a financial one. Considering the previous predictions and the fact that the news is more related to TikTok than Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news should be relatively low and close to each other. The news does not provide any significant positive or negative information about Apple's financials or operations, so the stock price movement is likely to be minimal."

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

The consistent prediction of a higher probability of a price rise by openai/gpt-4o-mini across all rounds, referencing unrelated positive news, suggests a potential bias in that model.  Considering the overall lack of direct relevance and the wide range of previous predictions, I'm assigning probabilities close to 0.5, reflecting the neutral impact of this generic news item.  The slight upward trend in some models' predictions across rounds is likely due to the inclusion of other, more relevant news items in the previous rounds, rather than the headline itself.

App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses a potential ban on TikTok in the United States, which could impact Apple Inc. as the app is available on the App Store. However, the article does not directly mention any significant financial impact on Apple. The ban would primarily affect TikTok and its users, rather than Apple's financials. Apple's role in the situation is limited to removing the app from its store and ceasing updates, which is a regulatory compliance issue rather than a financial one. Considering the previous predictions and the fact that the news is more related to TikTok than Apple, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling due to this news should be relatively low and close to each other. The news does not provide any significant positive or negative information about Apple's financials or operations, so the stock price movement is likely to be minimal."

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A positive outcome would be if Barclays offers Apple more favorable terms, leading to increased revenue or reduced costs for Apple's financial services. This could boost investor confidence and drive the stock price up. However, a negative outcome could involve less favorable terms, a more complex integration process, or potential disruptions to Apple Card services. This could negatively impact investor sentiment and lead to a stock price decline.  Given the lack of specifics, it's difficult to definitively assess the impact.  The probability of a price rise is assigned a slightly higher value due to the potential for improved financial terms for Apple, but the uncertainty warrants a significant probability of no change or even a slight decline."

This move is likely to increase Apple's brand presence and customer engagement in China, potentially leading to higher sales and revenue. The opening of a new store also suggests that Apple is confident in its growth prospects and is willing to invest in new markets. However, the impact of this news on the stock price may be limited, as it is a relatively small development in the grand scheme of Apple's global operations. Nevertheless, the positive sentiment and potential for increased sales and revenue make it more likely that the stock price will rise than fall."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This move is likely to increase Apple's brand presence and customer engagement in China, potentially leading to higher sales and revenue. The opening of a new store also suggests that Apple is confident in its growth prospects and is willing to invest in new markets. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of positive and negative sentiments. However, the positive sentiment and potential for increased sales and revenue make it more likely that the stock price will rise than fall."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Conversely, worse terms or disruptions could negatively impact investor sentiment and cause a price fall.  The previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding this news. Some models focus on positive aspects like Apple's AI initiatives or TSMC's positive outlook, while others highlight negative factors such as declining sales in China and competitive pressures.  Given the lack of concrete information about the Barclays partnership and the conflicting signals from previous predictions, I assign a relatively neutral probability to both price rise and fall, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the potential for improved financial terms.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Some models emphasize positive factors like Apple's AI initiatives and TSMC's strong outlook, while others highlight negative factors such as declining sales in China and competitive pressures.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires. Architects Explain Why As E-Bikes Boom in NYC, Some Call for More Regulations Chicago Agency Pitches $1.5 Billion Plan to Fix Transit Woes NYPD Reforms Car Chase Policy Amid Rising Crashes, Injuries Churches, Cinemas \u2014 and Moon Artifacts \u2014 Top List of Endangered Monuments\n\nThe main chipmaker to Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. foresees spending $38 billion to $42 billion on technology and capacity this year, or up to 19% more than analysts anticipated. It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The fact that 9 of the 10 largest companies are moving into AI is a strong indicator of future growth potential for companies like Apple.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple potentially switching credit card partners is ambiguous and doesn't provide enough information for a definitive prediction.  The impact depends entirely on the terms of the new partnership with Barclays.  However, the consistent negative sentiment across multiple prediction rounds regarding Apple's declining sales in China and increased competition significantly outweighs the potential positives from a new credit card partnership.  While some models highlight positive factors like Apple's AI initiatives and TSMC's strong outlook, the China market challenges appear to be a more significant concern for investors.  The overall trend in previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, although the uncertainty remains high.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall, acknowledging the significant uncertainty."

While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

While Apple is mentioned in the context of removing TikTok from its app store and ceasing updates, the overall impact on Apple's business is likely to be minimal. Apple is a large, diversified company, and the absence of TikTok from its app store is unlikely to significantly affect its revenue or user base. The article mentions that Apple declined to comment, suggesting they don't see this as a major issue. Therefore, the news is unlikely to cause a significant stock price movement in either direction.

Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses the impending ban of TikTok in the US and the measures being taken to enforce it.  Apple's role is significant as it will be removing TikTok from its app store and will no longer distribute updates. While the direct financial impact on Apple from losing TikTok's app store revenue might be relatively small compared to Apple's overall revenue, the news highlights Apple's compliance with US government regulations.  The potential for negative sentiment towards Apple due to the ban is low, as Apple is simply complying with the law.  There's no indication of any direct negative consequences for Apple's business or reputation.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price drop is low, and the probability of a price rise or remaining unchanged is higher.  The overall market sentiment and other factors will likely have a much larger impact on Apple's stock price than this specific news."

App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

While this action is required by law, the direct financial impact on Apple is likely minimal. Apple is a large, diversified company, and the absence of TikTok from its app store is unlikely to significantly affect its revenue or user base. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a rise due to other news (credit card partnership, AI investment) and others predicting a fall due to market share loss in China. Considering this news alone, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral to slightly negative. However, given the other factors at play (as indicated by previous rounds), and the fact that Apple is simply complying with the law, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a more balanced view, slightly favoring a fall due to the negative association with the ban."

Considering the minimal direct impact on Apple's financials and the likelihood that the market will quickly move past this event, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the lack of direct negative consequences for Apple and the potential for a neutral or even slightly positive reaction from investors who see Apple complying with regulations.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but the majority lean towards a positive outlook due to Apple's potential for growth and innovation. However, some models have expressed caution due to various factors such as market share loss in China. Given the current news focus on AI investment, which is generally viewed as a positive factor for tech companies like Apple, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be higher than falling. The overall sentiment from previous predictions and the positive implications of AI investment lead to a higher probability of the stock price rising."

                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

While this action is required by law, the direct financial impact on Apple is likely minimal. Apple is a large, diversified company, and the absence of TikTok from its app store is unlikely to significantly affect its revenue or user base. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a rise due to other news (credit card partnership, AI investment) and others predicting a fall due to market share loss in China. Considering this news alone, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral to slightly negative. However, given the other factors at play (as indicated by previous rounds), and the fact that Apple is simply complying with the law, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a more balanced view, slightly favoring a fall due to the negative association with the ban. Also, considering the trend of previous predictions, the models that focused on the TikTok ban generally predicted a slight fall in stock price."

While Apple's direct financial impact is likely minimal given its overall size and diversification, the news introduces some indirect risk. The ban is controversial, and negative sentiment surrounding it *could* marginally impact Apple's stock price. However, Apple's compliance with the law is unlikely to be viewed negatively by investors.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news, and many focused on other unrelated news (credit card partnerships, AI investments, China market share). Considering the minimal direct impact on Apple's financials and the likelihood that the market will quickly move past this event, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low.  The probability of a price rise is slightly higher than a price fall due to the lack of direct negative consequences for Apple and the potential for a neutral or even slightly positive reaction from investors who see Apple complying with regulations.  The overall probability of a price change is weighted down by the fact that this news is relatively minor compared to other factors influencing Apple's stock price.  The previous rounds show a persistent divergence of opinion, suggesting that other factors are significantly influencing predictions.  Therefore, I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability, slightly favoring a rise due to the lack of direct negative consequences for Apple."

                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

While this action is required by law, the direct financial impact on Apple is likely minimal. Apple is a large, diversified company, and the absence of TikTok from its app store is unlikely to significantly affect its revenue or user base. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models predicting a rise due to other news (credit card partnership, AI investment) and others predicting a fall due to market share loss in China. Considering this news alone, the impact on Apple's stock is likely neutral to slightly negative. However, given the other factors at play (as indicated by previous rounds), and the fact that Apple is simply complying with the law, I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect a more balanced view, slightly favoring a fall due to the negative association with the ban. Also, considering the trend of previous predictions, the models that focused on the TikTok ban generally predicted a slight fall in stock price. Therefore, I predict a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling."

However, Apple's compliance with the law is unlikely to be viewed negatively by investors.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news, and many focused on other unrelated news (credit card partnerships, AI investments, China market share).  Considering the minimal direct impact on Apple's financials and the likelihood that the market will quickly move past this event, the probability of a significant price movement in either direction is low. The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed, with some models predicting a rise due to other positive news (credit card partnership, AI investment) and others predicting a fall due to market share loss in China.  The TikTok ban news itself is relatively minor compared to these other factors.  Therefore, I'm assigning a relatively neutral probability, slightly favoring a rise due to the lack of direct negative consequences for Apple and the overall positive sentiment surrounding other aspects of the company's performance."

It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023.

Apple's shipments in China plummeted 25% in Q4 and 17% for the full year, falling behind Vivo and Huawei in the overall 2024 market share. This indicates increasing competition and potential loss of market share in a crucial market. The rise of Huawei, fueled by patriotic sentiment and domestic chip advancements, poses a significant threat. Apple's attempts to counter this with discounts and improved retail experiences might not be enough to offset the negative impact. The overall market growth in China is a positive sign, but Apple's underperformance relative to its competitors suggests a potential negative impact on its stock price. Given the negative trends outweigh the positive, a stock price fall is more likely."

While they regained the top spot in Q4 2024, their overall yearly performance shows a substantial drop (17% year-over-year) and a loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo. This suggests weakening market position in a key region.  The aggressive price cuts implemented by Apple to stimulate sales further highlight the competitive pressure they face.  The resurgence of Huawei, fueled by new domestically produced chips, poses a serious long-term threat.  While the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's struggles within that market are concerning.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple. While regaining the top spot in Q4 in China is positive, the overall yearly decline in shipments (17%) and loss of the top spot to Huawei and Vivo are significant negatives.  The aggressive price cuts to boost sales highlight competitive pressure. Huawei's resurgence, driven by domestic chip production and patriotic sentiment, poses a substantial threat.  Although the overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, Apple's underperformance is concerning.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some emphasizing the negative aspects (market share loss, price cuts) and others focusing on potential mitigating factors (Q4 recovery, Apple's overall strength).  Considering the significant negative trends outweighing the positive Q4 performance, and the lack of information on how Apple's AI initiatives will impact the situation, a price fall is more likely. However, Apple's overall brand strength and diversification beyond smartphones should mitigate the impact. Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but not as high as some previous predictions."

The overall Chinese smartphone market is recovering, but Apple's underperformance is concerning.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting the mixed signals. The negative trends (market share loss, price cuts, Huawei's rise) outweigh the positive Q4 performance.

That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This expansion suggests continued growth and investment in a key market. The store opening is timed around Chinese New Year, a period of high consumer spending, and includes special edition products and workshops tailored to the holiday. The news also highlights Apple's latest products, including the iPhone 16 and Apple Vision Pro, which could drive sales. While a single store opening is unlikely to cause a massive surge in stock price, it signals positive momentum and commitment to the Chinese market. Therefore, the probability of a slight rise is higher than a fall. However, the impact is likely to be small, so the probability is not overwhelmingly high."

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro headset and Apple Intelligence is concerning, but not necessarily a death knell.  The potential for further tariffs adds uncertainty.  Weighing these factors, the negative news is substantial enough to suggest a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but the long-term prospects remain relatively strong given Apple's overall market position.  The probability estimates reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty."

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections.

The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer.

This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official.

But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates.

                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix.

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The lukewarm reception of new products and the potential for further tariffs add to the uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the ambiguity of the situation.  The significant negative news regarding China sales, however, outweighs the positive aspects of Apple's overall market position in the short term.  Considering the immediate impact of the reported sales decline and credit card uncertainty, the probability of a price fall is higher than a rise in the short term.

Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

                                    "reasoning": "The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its plans to increase capital expenditure has a positive impact on the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, especially for iPhone chips, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a stable or potentially increased demand for Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price may be moderate since the news is primarily about TSMC's performance and outlook. The overall sentiment suggests a positive impact on tech stocks due to sustained AI spending, but Apple's stock movement may also be influenced by its own product cycle and market conditions. Given this, there's a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but the movement is likely to be moderate."

                                    "headline": "How a TikTok ban would work - and why user workarounds won't",
                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about a potential TikTok ban in the United States and its implementation details does not directly impact Apple's financials. However, as TikTok is a popular app available on the App Store, any disruption to its service could indirectly affect Apple. Considering the ban's primary impact is on TikTok and not directly on Apple, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is relatively low. The provided previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models suggest a low to moderate impact on Apple's stock price due to various pieces of news. Given the indirect nature of the impact and the lack of direct financial implications for Apple in this specific news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight leaning towards a stable or minor negative impact due to the potential for decreased user engagement with the App Store if popular apps like TikTok are banned."

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  The significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) is a major negative factor, exacerbated by increasing competition and potential government subsidies favoring local brands.  The uncertainty surrounding a new credit card partner also adds to the negative sentiment.  While Apple maintains its position as the world's most valuable company and boasts a loyal customer base, the lukewarm reception of new products like the Vision Pro and Apple Intelligence, coupled with potential future tariffs, casts doubt on its near-term growth prospects.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation.  However, the significant negative news regarding China sales and credit card uncertainty outweighs the positive aspects of Apple's overall market position in the short term.  Considering the immediate impact of these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a rise.  The long-term prospects remain strong due to Apple's overall market position and brand loyalty, but the short-term outlook is clouded by the negative news.  My prediction leans towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, but acknowledges the potential for resilience and recovery in the long term.  The probabilities reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts."

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates.

                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

Considering the ban's primary impact is on TikTok and not directly on Apple, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is relatively low. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models suggest a low to moderate impact on Apple's stock price due to various pieces of news. Given the indirect nature of the impact and the lack of direct financial implications for Apple in this specific news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight leaning towards a stable or minor negative impact due to the potential for decreased user engagement with the App Store if popular apps like TikTok are banned."

Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It indicates continued investment in a key market and leverages the Chinese New Year season. The store features and offerings are designed to enhance customer experience and drive sales. While a single store opening won't drastically impact the stock price, it contributes to positive momentum. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, the sentiment is generally positive, but not overwhelmingly so. I'll adjust the probabilities to reflect this, leaning slightly towards a rise, but acknowledging the limited impact of a single store."

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed picture for Apple.  A significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) is a major negative factor, amplified by growing competition and potential government subsidies favoring domestic brands.  The uncertainty surrounding a new credit card partner adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple retains its position as the world's most valuable company and boasts strong brand loyalty, the lukewarm reception of new products (Vision Pro, Apple Intelligence), coupled with potential future tariffs, clouds near-term growth prospects.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting the situation's ambiguity.  However, the substantial negative news regarding China sales and credit card uncertainty outweighs the positive aspects of Apple's overall market position in the short term.  The long-term prospects remain strong due to Apple's market position and brand loyalty, but the short-term outlook is negatively impacted.  Considering the immediate impact of these factors, the probability of a price fall is higher than a rise.  My prediction leans towards a higher probability of a price fall in the short term, acknowledging the potential for resilience and recovery in the long term. The probabilities reflect this balance, leaning slightly towards a price fall due to the immediate negative impacts."

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates.

However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price may be moderate since the news is primarily about TSMC's performance and outlook. The overall sentiment suggests a positive impact on tech stocks due to sustained AI spending, but Apple's stock movement may also be influenced by its own product cycle and market conditions.

                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

However, as TikTok is a popular app available on the App Store, any disruption to its service could indirectly affect Apple. Considering the ban's primary impact is on TikTok and not directly on Apple, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is relatively low. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models suggest a low to moderate impact on Apple's stock price due to various pieces of news. Given the indirect nature of the impact and the lack of direct financial implications for Apple in this specific news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight leaning towards a stable or minor negative impact due to the potential for decreased user engagement with the App Store if popular apps like TikTok are banned."

These factors align with previous predictions indicating a positive outlook due to expansion and seasonal events. However, the magnitude of impact is expected to be moderate, considering it is a single store opening. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a general consensus that the news is slightly positive, but with a few models leaning towards a negative outlook due to other market uncertainties."

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This suggests a positive outlook for Apple's stock price as it positions itself within a growing sector. The emphasis on AI's growth potential and the stability of established companies like Apple indicates increased investor interest. While there are some mixed signals regarding sales in China and competition, the overall sentiment around AI investments and Apple's established market position supports a higher probability of stock price rise compared to fall. Therefore, I estimate a probability of 0.70 for the stock price rising and 0.30 for it falling."

While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

The significant drop in iPhone sales in China (25% YoY) is a major negative factor, outweighing the positive impact of a single new store opening in China.  Increased competition and potential government subsidies favoring local brands further exacerbate this negative trend. The uncertainty surrounding a new credit card partner adds to the negative sentiment. While Apple maintains its position as the world's most valuable company and boasts strong brand loyalty, the lukewarm reception of new products (Vision Pro, Apple Intelligence), coupled with potential future tariffs, casts doubt on its near-term growth prospects.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation.  However, the weight of negative news regarding China sales, credit card uncertainty, and weak product traction suggests a higher probability of a short-term price fall.  Apple's long-term prospects remain strong due to its overall market position and brand loyalty, but the short-term outlook is clouded by the negative news.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

                                    "reasoning": "The news about TSMC's upbeat outlook for 2025 AI spending and its plans to increase capital expenditure has a positive impact on the stock market, particularly for companies related to AI and semiconductor industries. As Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a major customer of TSMC, especially for iPhone chips, the positive outlook for TSMC suggests a stable or potentially increased demand for Apple's products. However, the direct impact on Apple's stock price may be moderate since the news is primarily about TSMC's performance and outlook. The overall sentiment suggests a positive impact on tech stocks due to sustained AI spending, but Apple's stock movement may also be influenced by its own product cycle and market conditions. Considering the previous predictions, which show a range of opinions but generally a slightly positive sentiment, I estimate the probability of Apple's stock price rising to be higher."

                                    "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Social media app TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, will be banned in the United States on Sunday unless a deal comes together to sell it to a U.S. investor or the U.S. Supreme Court intervenes.\n\nThe ban results from an April law signed by President Joe Biden and is the first time the United States has attempted to shut down access to an app with such a large user base - roughly 170 million domestic users.\n\nTo pull it off, the law targets a wide swath of U.S.-based partners that help bring TikTok to users, rendering most easy workarounds such as using a virtual private network or changing a phone's country settings moot or difficult to use, experts told Reuters.\n\nAt best, users might be able to access a web-based version of the service that has fewer features than the app, and even that might not work, experts said.\n\nHere's a closer look at how the ban will be implemented.\n\nAPP 'ROTS'\n\nThe law will not force users to delete the app. But TikTok plans to shut down the service and will show users a message about the law and offer to let them download their personal data, Reuters previously reported.\n\nEven if TikTok was not planning a formal shutdown, the app would not work as well as it did before. App store providers are explicitly barred from distributing TikTok to U.S. users, which means that Apple and Alphabet's Google will remove the app from their stores and will no longer distribute updates to fix bugs.\n\nThe TikTok app also relies on a constant flow of new videos, which would become nearly impossible to deliver. TikTok data for U.S. users is hosted and processed on servers owned by Oracle, which most experts believe Oracle would have to cease those operations.\n\nOracle, Apple, Google and TikTok all either declined to comment or did not return requests for comment.\n\nBeyond that, analyses have shown that more than 100 other service providers, such as content delivery networks, help make TikTok operate smoothly.\n\n\"Some subset of that stuff that is required for the app to actually work, both in terms of getting video to you, but also in terms of getting video and content up,\" said Joseph Lorenzo Hall, a distinguished technologist with nonprofit group Internet Society. \"And so uploading might be one of the first things to go. Americans may only be able to watch as their app rots.\"\n\nThe disengagement of those service providers could also affect tens of millions of TikTok users outside the U.S., but company engineers are working to address those issues, sources told Reuters.\n\nStory Continues\n\nTWO PHONES AND A TRIP TO TORONTO?\n\nThe most straightforward workaround to keep access to TikTok would be to use a virtual private network, or VPN, which can conceal the internet protocol, or IP, address of a user and thereby their location.\n\nBut TikTok has other means of knowing where the user is located, such as geolocation data from a phone, said Jason Kelley, director of activism for the Electronic Frontier Foundation.\n\nUsers could try to access a web-based version of TikTok via a browser while using a VPN, but the web version lacks many features of the app and - if the user has to create a new account - would not be as personalized to the user's preferences.\n\n\"It won't be a good service for you, and it won't be a profitable service for them,\" Kelley said.\n\nSome users have discussed steps such as switching an iPhone's country settings to another country in a bid to keep using the app. But that would require cancelling existing app subscriptions and setting up a new payment method for that country, according to Apple documentation.\n\nIt is enough of a hassle that it may be easier to purchase a separate phone dedicated to the app, leading Hall to joke that the law could result in \"Congress forcing the influencer population to carry two phones, just like most of them do.\"\n\nBut even switching an iPhone's settings to a different country is not a straightforward fix. The law bars Apple and other app store providers from delivering the TikTok app to users in the United States regardless of how their devices are configured, so a user would still have to leave the United States to download TikTok.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis and Max Cherney in San Francisco; additional reporting by David Shepardson in Washington D.C.; editing by Kenneth Li and Nia Williams)",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about a potential TikTok ban in the United States does not directly impact Apple's financials. However, as TikTok is a popular app available on the App Store, any disruption to its service could indirectly affect Apple. Considering the ban's primary impact is on TikTok and not directly on Apple, the probability of a significant stock price movement due to this news is relatively low. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models suggest a low to moderate impact on Apple's stock price due to various pieces of news. Given the indirect nature of the impact and the lack of direct financial implications for Apple in this specific news, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are estimated to be close to equal, with a slight leaning towards a stable or minor negative impact due to the potential for decreased user engagement with the App Store if popular apps like TikTok are banned."

Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

Historically, Cook has had a good relationship with Trump, which could bode well for Apple in terms of policy influence, especially regarding tariffs and antitrust issues. The tech industry's general alignment with Trump suggests a pro-business environment, which could benefit Apple.

Local brands Vivo and Huawei move ahead as Apple's shipments drop 17% to 42.9 million units, bringing its market share down to 15%, according to Canalys.\n\nVivo takes the lead with 49.3 million units shipped, gaining 17% market share after an 11% increase in sales. Huawei follows closely, shipping 46 million units, a 37% surge from 2023, regaining ground despite U.S. restrictions limiting its chip supply. China's smartphone market rebounds, shipping 285 million units in 2024, growing 4% year-over-year after two years of declines. Analysts point to affordable premium designs, in-house chips, and foldable phone innovations as key drivers.\n\nOppo and Honor complete the top five smartphone makers in China.Moreover, Apple's struggles come amid increased competition from local brands offering advanced AI features and custom operating systems. The shift highlights China's growing preference for homegrown technology over foreign brands.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

This decline is attributed to strong competition from local brands like Vivo and Huawei, which are innovating and gaining market share. The overall growth in the Chinese smartphone market may not be sufficient to offset Apple's losses, leading to negative sentiment among investors.

While the headline doesn't explicitly mention Apple's specific AI initiatives, it's highly probable that Apple is among the companies making these moves, given its size and technological focus. This general trend is likely to be viewed positively by investors, as AI is seen as a growth area. However, the lack of specific details about Apple's AI strategy compared to its competitors makes the impact less certain. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mixed sentiment. Some models focused on negative news about Apple's market share in China, while others highlighted the positive aspects of AI investment. Given the general positive sentiment surrounding AI and the likelihood that Apple is involved, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price rise, but not overwhelmingly so, as the news is more about a general trend than a specific Apple announcement. I am also weighing in the previous predictions, and trying to be in the middle of the previous predictions."

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline \"Investing in Metaverse Stocks\" is too generic to have a significant impact on Apple's stock price.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting the lack of direct Apple-specific information in the provided news. Some models focused on negative news regarding Apple's market share in China, leading to predictions of a stock price fall. Others highlighted positive general trends in the tech sector (AI investment) or potential political advantages, leading to predictions of a rise.  Given the lack of direct relevance of the headline to Apple and the conflicting interpretations in previous predictions, I conclude that the news is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in either direction.

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

                                    "content": "When Donald Trump is sworn in as the 47th president of the United States on Monday, some of the biggest names in the tech industry will be cheering on the commander in chief as he returns to the Oval Office.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos and Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will attend the event, according to NBC News. Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook, who has historically had a good relationship with Trump, will also be at the inauguration, the New York Times reported. They\u2019ll be joined by Trump booster and Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk. Even TikTok CEO Shou Chew, who is hoping Trump will save the social media platform from being effectively shut down in the US, will be on hand, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nBut these executives aren't just taking seats at the inauguration, with many tech leaders among the biggest backers of the president-elect since his win in November.\n\nCook also contributed to Trump\u2019s inauguration, according to Axios, as did Amazon and Meta, with CNBC reporting on contributions from Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNone of this would be particularly out of the ordinary during most inaugural funding announcements.\n\nAfter all, tech companies and executives also donated to Biden\u2019s inaugural committee.\n\nBut Trump has publicly sparred with a number of tech leaders in the past, including Bezos and Zuckerberg, even going as far as threatening to jail the latter.\n\n\"It speaks to two things,\" Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster told Yahoo Finance.\n\n\"No. 1 is that tech companies have understood over the past five years that Washington is a bigger X factor in their future, and so there's just a natural willingness to work more closely with the administration.\n\n\u201cThe second is Trump values loyalty, and one way that people kind of express loyalty to him is to give money. And so, for him to take you seriously, you have to get to pay to play.\u201dPresident-elect Donald Trump, Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Vice President-elect JD Vance attend the 125th Army-Navy football game at Northwest Stadium on December 14, 2024 in Landover, Maryland. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)\u00b7Kevin Dietsch via Getty Images\n\nTech\u2019s testy relationship with Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may have the most to gain by turning around their relationships with Trump. Bezos had a tumultuous relationship with the president-elect during his first term due to the fact that the Amazon chairman also owns the Washington Post.\n\nTrump regularly sparred with Bezos online, tying the Post\u2019s coverage of him to Bezos himself.\n\nIn the lead-up to the election, Bezos made a move to prevent the Post\u2019s editorial board from backing Vice President Kamala Harris for president.\n\nIn defending the decision, Bezos said endorsements create a perception of bias. (Though the paper said at the time it would continue to endorse candidates in local races.)\n\nStory Continues\n\nHundreds of thousands of Post subscribers canceled their subscriptions following Bezos\u2019s decision.Money for something? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Image: Reuters /Manuel Orbegozo)\u00b7REUTERS / Reuters\n\nBezos runs SpaceX rival Blue Origin, and getting on Trump\u2019s good side could mean better opportunities to win government contracts in the years ahead. That\u2019ll be especially important for the company at a time when SpaceX CEO Musk has the president-elect\u2019s ear.\n\nZuckerberg has been on Trump\u2019s bad side for years. Trump called out Zuckerberg during his first term, claiming the Meta CEO was purposely silencing conservative voices on his platforms. Things got worse from there when Zuckerberg suspended Trump\u2019s Facebook account following the Jan. 6, 2020, attack on the Capitol.\n\nAs Trump looked more like he would win the election, Zuckerberg had been transforming himself and his company to win over the president-elect. The CEO has made controversial moves, including killing off its fact-checking program in favor of a community notes style of fact-checking similar to that found on X. Zuckerberg also put an end to the company\u2019s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts, joining a chorus of executives taking similar actions.\n\nTech goes all in on Trump\n\nBezos and Zuckerberg may be the most noteworthy executives to back Trump, thanks to their prior run-ins, but they aren\u2019t the only ones. And political donations certainly aren\u2019t out of the realm of the ordinary for American companies.\n\n\u201cAll of these executives support whoever is president with monetary donations,\u201d Zeus Kerravala, founder and principal analyst at ZK Research, told Yahoo Finance. \u201cHowever, this administration will be pro-business and these current executives making big donations are ensuring that they have a voice at the table when policies are being made.\u201d\n\nThat includes AI companies like OpenAI, which also donated to Trump\u2019s inauguration effort. The AI industry is rapidly evolving, and tech firms are eager to have Trump\u2019s ear to ensure they have input when it comes to any potential future AI regulations.\n\nIt won\u2019t hurt for Altman to get off on the right foot with Trump, either. Especially since Musk, who is trying to dismantle OpenAI, is already so close to the future president. Apple's Cook, meanwhile, would have the president\u2019s ear to discuss the potential for tariffs and their impact on Apple\u2019s revenue, not to mention the company\u2019s ongoing antitrust issues.\n\nMicrosoft and Google, for their part, could benefit from being in Trump\u2019s good graces at a time when the companies are facing increased scrutiny around mergers and acquisitions. Like Apple, the firms could also seek out assistance when it comes to antitrust matters.\n\nNow tech leaders will need to continue working to ensure their efforts to woo Trump pay off or risk their plans going up in smoke.\n\n\u201cThis is just a reality of navigating the world that's become more political,\u201d Munster added.Sign up for Yahoo Finance's Week in Tech newsletter.\u00b7yahoofinance\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

                                    "reasoning": "The news highlights Apple Inc. (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook's participation in President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, alongside other tech leaders, indicating a potential favorable relationship with the incoming administration. Historically, Cook has had a good relationship with Trump, which could benefit Apple in terms of policy influence, especially regarding tariffs and antitrust issues. The tech industry's general alignment with Trump suggests a pro-business environment, which could be positive for Apple. However, the news does not indicate any immediate financial or operational impact on Apple, making the effect on the stock price more speculative. Given the positive sentiment and potential for favorable policies, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the impact is likely to be moderate. Previous predictions have been mixed, with some models focusing on negative news about Apple's market share in China, while others highlighted positive general trends in the tech sector. Considering the lack of immediate financial impact and the speculative nature of the news, the probabilities are balanced slightly in favor of a rise."

Huawei follows closely, shipping 46 million units, a 37% surge from 2023, regaining ground despite U.S. restrictions limiting its chip supply. China's smartphone market rebounds, shipping 285 million units in 2024, growing 4% year-over-year after two years of declines. Analysts point to affordable premium designs, in-house chips, and foldable phone innovations as key drivers.\n\nOppo and Honor complete the top five smartphone makers in China.Moreover, Apple's struggles come amid increased competition from local brands offering advanced AI features and custom operating systems.

                                    "content": "Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

This decline in market share, coupled with a significant drop in shipments (25% year-on-year), suggests increased competition and challenges for Apple in a crucial market. Although Apple managed to lead in the fourth quarter, the overall trend for 2024 appears negative. The company's efforts to boost sales through discounts and improved retail experiences may not be sufficient to counteract the competitive pressures and declining shipments. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

China is a significant market for Apple, and this loss of market share is negative news. However, the impact on Apple's overall financial performance might be limited, as China represents only a portion of Apple's global sales.  Furthermore, Apple's revenue is diversified across various product lines (iPads, Macs, services, etc.), reducing the impact of a single market's decline.  While the news is negative, the overall effect on the stock price is likely to be muted due to the diversification of Apple's business.  A small price drop is possible, but a significant fall is less likely given Apple's overall financial strength and the limited information available in the headline."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

                                    "content": "Apple recaptured the top spot in China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter, but it fell to third place in 2024 after a year of escalating competition from domestic players, including a resurgent Huawei Technologies.\n\nThe US tech giant saw smartphone shipments in China plummet 25 per cent to 13.1 million units in the three months through December, down from 17.5 million a year earlier, according to data released by research firm Canalys on Thursday. It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

This decline in market share and the increased competition from domestic players suggest a challenging environment for Apple in a crucial market. Although Apple managed to lead in the fourth quarter, the overall trend for 2024 appears negative, with a 17% decline in shipments for the full year. The company's efforts to boost sales through discounts and improved retail experiences may not be sufficient to counteract these competitive pressures. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

The previous rounds show a wide range of opinions, with some focusing on other news about Apple's performance in China. However, focusing solely on the metaverse news, it's difficult to determine the impact without knowing the size, scope, and strategy behind Apple's investment. Given the hype around the metaverse has cooled down, a generic investment announcement is unlikely to cause a significant price surge. However, it also doesn't present any immediate negative implications. Therefore, I'll lean slightly towards a neutral to slightly positive outlook, but not strongly in either direction. I will also consider the trend of previous predictions, which seem to be fluctuating.

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

                                    "reasoning": "The news indicates that Apple has lost its top position in the Chinese smartphone market, falling to third place behind Huawei and Vivo, with a significant drop in shipments (25% year-on-year). This decline in market share and increased competition from domestic players suggest a challenging environment for Apple in a crucial market. Although Apple managed to lead in the fourth quarter, the overall trend for 2024 appears negative, with a 17% decline in shipments for the full year. The company's efforts to boost sales through discounts and improved retail experiences may not be sufficient to counteract these competitive pressures. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is higher than that of it rising."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

Although Apple managed to lead in the fourth quarter, the overall trend for 2024 appears negative, with a 17% decline in shipments for the full year.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

It narrowly edged out Chinese vendors Vivo and Huawei, which each shipped 12.9 million smartphones, giving all three companies a market share of roughly 17 per cent.\n\nXiaomi and Oppo ranked fourth and fifth in the fourth quarter, shipping 12.2 million and 10.6 million units, respectively.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHuawei has seen rapid growth in the Chinese smartphone market since the US-sanctioned firm introduced new home-grown chips in 2023. Its shipments were up 24 per cent year on year for the quarter and 37 per cent for the full year. Its shipments reached 46 million units last year, according to Canalys.\n\nFor the full year, Apple was behind Vivo and Huawei in its second-most important market, after reaching the top in 2023. Its shipments fell 17 per cent to 42.9 million units for the year. The iPhone maker made up 15 per cent of the market, while Vivo and Huawei took 17 per cent and 16 per cent, respectively.\n\nChina's smartphone market as a whole saw shipments rise 5 per cent to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter, and shipments were up 4 per cent for the full year to 285 million units, according to Canalys. It marked a recovery in the region after two years of decline.\n\nRising domestic competition, worsened by US-China tensions that have contributed to patriotic rallying around Huawei, has put pressure on Apple in China as it also faces uncertainty around the launch of its new artificial intelligence service on the mainland. Its shipments in the market were down 25 per cent and 6 per cent year on year in the first and third quarters. In the second quarter, it fell out of the top five.\n\n\"Intense competition has led to a constantly shifting landscape, with vendors actively seeking to expand investments in their advantageous field,\" Canalys research manager Amber Liu said in the report.\n\n\"In addition to driving sales through seasonal promotions, Apple is enhancing its high-end competitiveness and user retention by improving retail experiences through channel management, offering trade-in programmes and expanding coverage of interest-free instalment plans,\" she added.\n\nStory Continues\n\nThe company has been offering rare discounts to Chinese consumers to boost sales. Earlier this month, Apple introduced new price cuts for iPhones and other products on its China website and at bricks-and-mortar Apple Store locations to help boost sales on the mainland.\n\nCanalys forecasts smartphone shipments in China will surpass 290 million units this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Apple losing its top spot in the Chinese smartphone market is significant negative news.  A 25% year-over-year drop in shipments is a substantial decline in a key market. While Apple's business is diversified, China's importance cannot be ignored.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact. Some models highlight the potential positive impact of AI investments, while others focus on the negative impact of the lost market share.  However, the direct impact of the negative news regarding the Chinese market is likely to be negative in the short term.  Considering the significant drop in shipments and the increased competition, I assign a higher probability to a stock price fall.  The lack of detailed financial information in the accessible portion of the article makes it difficult to precisely quantify the impact, but the negative trend is clear. The consistent leaning towards a higher probability of a price drop in previous rounds reinforces this assessment.  While Apple's overall financial health and diverse product portfolio might mitigate the impact, the immediate negative news related to a significant market share loss in China outweighs the potential positives in the short term."

                                    "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. projected quarterly sales and capital expenditure ahead of analysts\u2019 estimates, fueling hopes that spending on AI hardware should remain resilient in 2025.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nThese Homes Withstood the LA Fires.

It predicted revenue of $25 billion to $25.8 billion in the March quarter, as much as 6% above projections. Shares in TSMC suppliers including Tokyo Electron Ltd. and Advantest Corp. spiked in Asia.\n\nTSMC\u2019s strong performance buoyed optimism around an unprecedented AI spending cycle that drove the likes of Nvidia to new heights. The advent of ChatGPT spurred a frenzied datacenter build-out over the past two years, benefiting a host of companies that provide the piping and brains of the AI boom.\n\nStill, the lack of a big profit-generating AI application so far stoked concerns about a potential bubble. And like much of the industry, TSMC is grappling with uncertainties stemming from a US-China tech conflict that threatens to disrupt supply chains and stem the flow of chips around the world. The US this month announced new export control rules on AI chips to curtail their supply to China.\n\nFollow Chip Giant TSMC\u2019s Quarterly Results in Real Time: TOPLive\n\nAway from AI, TSMC remains heavily reliant on consumer electronics and smartphones, given Apple remains its largest customer. IPhone sales have proven muted, though the industry expects mobile AI features to expand over time, driving the broader market.\n\nOn Thursday, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei warned that smartphone unit growth will remain in the low-single-digits in 2025. But he added that there would be mild recovery in segments other than AI.\n\nThe world\u2019s biggest chipmaker reported a better-than-expected 57% rise in net income.\n\n\u201cFor the driver, besides the ongoing robust AI chip demand, there will be support from new smartphone chips and AI PCs, possibly more outsourcing orders from Intel, and WiFi 7 chips,\u201d Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Charles Shum said about the 2025 revenue outlook.\n\nWhat Bloomberg Intelligence Says\n\nTSMC may be able to retain over half of its existing orders from China, following the Biden administration\u2019s restrictions on advanced-chip production for country-exempt chips with fewer than 30 billion transistors, as reported by Bloomberg News. This would allow TSMC to maintain sales of smartphone SoCs and mid-range computing chips for China. Chinese chip orders accounted for 12.6% of TSMC\u2019s revenue in January-September.\n\nStory Continues\n\n- Charles Shum and Steven Tseng, analysts\n\nClick here for the research.\n\nInvestors monitor TSMC\u2019s capex for clues not just to chip and electronics demand, but also on the pace of its international expansion. The 2025 projection given Thursday represented a rise in spending of as much as 40% from 2024.\n\nGeopolitical tensions have pushed TSMC to manufacture abroad. It\u2019s planning more plants in Europe with a focus on the market for artificial intelligence chips, according to a senior Taiwanese official. That\u2019s on top of a German plant under construction in Dresden.\n\nOn Thursday, executives affirmed that the factory it\u2019s building in Arizona \u2014 a cornerstone of Biden administration policy \u2014 will house cutting-edge technology in future. But they stopped short of outlining a specific timeline. The most advanced semiconductors would continue to be produced domestically, executives stressed.\n\nFor 2025, TSMC projected growth in the mid-20% range, roughly in line with analysts\u2019 estimates. Executives emphasized that, despite a volatile smartphone arena, spending on AI will continue to drive growth.\n\n--With assistance from Cindy Wang, Vlad Savov, Ville Heiskanen and Debby Wu.\n\n(Updates with share action from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Swiss Sneaker Brand Outrunning Nike and Adidas At Charles Schwab, a Fresh Start After a Close Call How Long Can Toyota Put Off Figuring Out EVs?

Considering the mixed signals and the trend in previous predictions, the positive sentiment around AI and TSMC's performance is likely to outweigh the negatives, but with some caution due to the uncertainties.

The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo.

While it signifies continued expansion in a key market, the event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue.  The news is unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment or significantly affect the company's overall financial performance.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting the generally positive nature of expansion, but the effect is expected to be small and easily absorbed by other market factors."

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025.

While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting uncertainty about Apple's performance in the Chinese market. Some models highlight concerns about declining market share and competition from local brands.  However, the new store opening is a neutral to slightly positive event, unlikely to significantly alter investor sentiment in the short term.  Considering the previous predictions and the limited impact of a single store opening, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the effect is expected to be small and easily overshadowed by other market factors."

This decline is attributed to increased competition from local brands offering advanced AI features and custom operating systems, which are resonating more with Chinese consumers. The premarket trading reaction shows a fractional slip, indicating initial negative investor sentiment. Given the importance of the Chinese market to Apple's revenue and the competitive pressures, the likelihood of a stock price decline is higher. However, Apple's strong global brand and diversified product portfolio may mitigate some of the negative impact, but the immediate reaction is likely to be negative."

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023.

This decline, combined with the rise of competitors such as Huawei and vivo, suggests a negative impact on Apple's sales and market share in the region. Although the overall smartphone market in China is growing, Apple's loss of market share and decline in shipments are likely to have a negative effect on investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in the company's stock price. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a general consensus that the stock price is more likely to fall than rise due to this news. However, the probabilities of stock price movement can be influenced by various factors, including the company's overall financial performance, industry trends, and market conditions. Given the information provided, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising."

While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Apple's development of Apple Intelligence and its inclusion in their software provides a strong indication that the company is heavily investing in AI technology, which could potentially drive growth and increase its stock value. However, the previous predictions and the context provided indicate a mixed sentiment with a generally negative outlook due to concerns about Apple's market share in China and competition from local brands. Considering the AI investment as a positive factor but also taking into account the negative sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than falling."

With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025.

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about the opening of a new Apple store in Hefei, China, is a positive development, signaling continued investment and expansion in a key market. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term.  The event is relatively small-scale compared to Apple's overall global operations and revenue. Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, largely driven by concerns about declining market share in China and increased competition.  These concerns are more significant than the impact of a single new store opening.  While the new store opening is a positive sign, it's unlikely to significantly outweigh the negative sentiment stemming from the larger market trends. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is low, and the probability of a fall or no significant change is higher.  The overall impact is likely to be muted by other market factors.  The consensus from previous models, which largely focused on negative news regarding Apple's performance in China, further supports this assessment."

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(AAPL), are making significant moves in this area. Apple's development of Apple Intelligence and its inclusion in their software provides a strong indication that the company is heavily investing in AI technology, which could potentially drive growth and increase its stock value. However, previous predictions and context provided indicate a mixed sentiment with a generally negative outlook due to concerns about Apple's market share in China and competition from local brands. Considering the AI investment as a positive factor but also taking into account the negative sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than falling."

                                    "content": "Mainland China's smartphone market shipped 285 million units in 2024, achieving 4% annual growth following two years of decline, Canalys reported Thursday.

With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025. To attract customers across price points, vendors are anticipated to concentrate on increased product features including better battery life, creative form factors, and AI-powered systems.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

Although the overall smartphone market in China is growing, Apple's loss of market share and decline in shipments are likely to have a negative effect on investor sentiment and potentially lead to a decrease in the company's stock price.

                                    "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is taking some serious punches in China. While it held the top spot in Q4 2024 with 13.1 million iPhones shipped, its numbers cratered 25% year over year. Meanwhile, Huawei is on fireposting a jaw-dropping 37% growth in shipments for the year. The broader Chinese smartphone market is back in the green, up 4% in 2024, but Apple is slipping as local players like Xiaomi and OPPO ride a wave of aggressive pricing, foldable innovations, and AI-driven ecosystems. The Chinese government's latest subsidy push could fuel even more competition in 2025, making Apple's fight even tougher.\n\nBut the turbulence doesn't stop in China. Apple is scrambling to find a new credit card partner, with Barclays (NYSE:BCS) and Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) in talks to take over from Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Goldman, once eager to expand into consumer banking, is now pulling back, potentially leaving Apple in transition limbo. A shake-up in its credit card business could ripple into customer spending habitssomething Apple can't afford to mess up as it faces pressure on multiple fronts.\n\nDespite all this, Apple still wears the crown as the world's most valuable company, with a market cap north of $3.5 trillion. But investors are watching closely. Analysts warn that 2025 iPhone shipments could fall 10% below expectations, Trump's potential tariffs could add more uncertainty, and Apple's AI playdubbed Apple Intelligencehas been met with a lukewarm response. Even its hyped Vision Pro headset has barely made a dent in revenue. Sure, Apple has a fortress-like ecosystem and die-hard customer loyalty, but with mounting competition, weak product traction, and strategic pivots underway, the real question is: Can Apple still dominate, or is the empire starting to crack?\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "content": "It's no secret anymore. Artificial intelligence (AI) is driving the highest gains in the market, and several of the largest companies in the world today by market cap are only there because of AI. In fact, the five most valuable companies in the world are all making major inroads into AI, and the only one in the top 10 that's not is oil company Saudi Aramco.\n\nIf you're still on the sidelines, you might want to choose at least one AI-driven stock to add to your portfolio. They're not all the risky upstarts you might be imagining. In fact, this list only includes well-established industry giants that mostly have other businesses as well. That gives investors stability in their stock picks as well as exposure to the driving force behind the market's gains today.\n\nThe top five, and the top 10\n\nThe largest companies in the world today by market cap are:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Saudi Aramco Meta Platforms Tesla Broadcom Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nNearly all of these companies are making strides in developing an AI business. Apple is developing Apple Intelligence, providing its millions of users through its ecosystem with high-level consumer AI services included in its software. Nvidia has up to 95% of the global market for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips that drive generative AI. Microsoft and Amazon both offer groundbreaking generative AI solutions to cloud computing clients, and Alphabet is turning its Google search service, which has 90% of the overall search market, into an AI-powered solution. That's the future of internet searching.\n\nAs for the last four, Meta and Tesla are both using AI as part of their businesses, rather than creating AI solutions. For example, Meta is using AI as part of its virtual reality business, and Tesla uses AI to power much of the technology it uses in electric vehicles. Broadcom is a major player in the infrastructure that makes AI work, and Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures much of the world's GPUs and other chips.\n\nHere's a visual representation of the top 10 stocks and their recent market cap developments.AMZN Market Cap data by YCharts\n\nWhat about other big companies?\n\nWhat I find fascinating is that as you move past the top 10, the next 10 are almost entirely non-AI companies. On this level, the list consists of:\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Eli Lilly Walmart JPMorgan Chase Visa Tencent Mastercard ExxonMobil United HealthGroup Oracle\n\nWhy investors should pay attention\n\nIt's important to note that the combined market cap of the second tier is about $6 trillion, less than a third of the top tier, which has a combined market cap of more than $19 trillion. The first group isn't just bigger; it's much bigger. And I'll go out on a limb to say that the gap is going to widen this year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nImage source: Getty Images.\n\nThe AI opportunity is simply enormous, and even with the combined tailwinds of moderating inflation and lower interest rates, financial and retail stocks won't be able to catch it. The AI market is expected to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.67% through 2030 according to Statista, and the AI stocks on this list are going to be some of the main beneficiaries.\n\nI'll end with a cautionary note that while investors should definitely pay attention and invest in AI responsibly, they shouldn't put all of their savings into AI stocks. It's at least as important to reduce your risk through diversification, and if you own some solid, reliable value stocks, you can be more confident about putting your growth dollars to work for you with AI stocks.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(AAPL), are making significant moves in this area. Apple's development of Apple Intelligence and its inclusion in their software provides a strong indication that the company is heavily investing in AI technology, which could potentially drive growth and increase its stock value. However, the previous predictions and context provided indicate a mixed sentiment with a generally negative outlook due to concerns about Apple's market share in China and competition from local brands. Considering the AI investment as a positive factor but also taking into account the negative sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly lower than falling."

With 46 million units and the biggest annual increase among big brands37%Huawei trailed closely. With 42.9 million shipments, a 17% drop from 2023, Apple (AAPL, Financials) came third as domestic flagship smartphone competition grew. With each holding 15% market share, OPPO and HONOR completed the top five.\n\nDriven by government subsidies, year-end promotions, and a robust high-end market, smartphone shipments increased 5% year over year to 77.4 million units in the fourth quarter. With 13.1 million devices sold, Apple kept first but dropped 25% from the same time in 2023. With 12.9 million units each, Huawei and vivo tied for second place, with respectively 24% and 14% increase respectively. With a 29% increase in shipments to 12.2 million devices, Xiaomi (XIACF, Financials) ranked first among major suppliers in Q4.\n\nCiting favorable market circumstances, consistent demand recovery, and government assistance via subsidies launched in January, Canalys expects smartphone sales in Mainland China would top 290 million units in 2025.

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer.

While Cramer dismisses criticism of Apple's post-Jobs innovation as 'inflammatory', the article also highlights the uncertainty surrounding Apple's AI strategy and the overall market's reliance on tech stocks, particularly those in the NASDAQ.  Cramer's comments are largely neutral, neither strongly positive nor negative towards Apple. The article itself promotes other AI stocks as potentially more lucrative investments, indirectly suggesting a less bullish outlook on Apple's short-term prospects.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise or fall is considered relatively low due to the lack of strong directional sentiment in the news."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, as it could disrupt key features of its financial products. While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer retention, the potential operational disruption and negative sentiment from investors could lead to a decline in stock price. However, Apple's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Given the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, with some leaning towards a rise due to Apple's financial stability and others indicating a fall due to the partnership concerns, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall due to the immediate concerns raised by the news."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Key indicators such as low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest that Apple is well-positioned to manage its debt obligations. While the article acknowledges potential risks, the overall tone is optimistic, suggesting that investors are likely to view Apple's financial management favorably. Considering the previous round predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the models that focused on financial health leaned towards a price increase.

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good.

This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break.

The mixed sentiment, coupled with the previous predictions showing a wide range of probabilities (from 0.3 to 0.7 for a price rise), suggests a relatively neutral outlook.  The previous predictions' divergence indicates a lack of strong consensus on the impact of this news, reinforcing the neutral stance.  Considering the lack of significant positive or negative catalysts directly related to Apple's fundamentals in this news, the probabilities are weighted towards a slightly higher chance of a price remaining stable or experiencing a minor fluctuation rather than a significant rise or fall."

But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article cites BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Gargi Chaudhuri, who expects the 493 other stocks to post an 11% earnings growth this year, faster than the 8% growth in 2024. Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024. Given this information, it seems that the article is bearish on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and bullish on the other S&P 500 stocks. This, combined with the fact that Apple's stock has already fallen 8% year-to-date in 2025, suggests that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the article does not provide overwhelmingly negative information about Apple, and the company's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a higher chance of a stock price fall, but not excessively so."

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer retention may mitigate some negative impacts, the immediate concerns raised by the potential operational disruption and investor sentiment suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise due to Apple's financial stability, but the overall sentiment leans towards caution given the partnership concerns. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

(AAPL). The article cites BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Gargi Chaudhuri, who expects the 493 other stocks to post an 11% earnings growth this year, faster than the 8% growth in 2024. Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024. Given this information, it seems that the article is bearish on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and bullish on the other S&P 500 stocks. This, combined with the fact that Apple's stock has already fallen 8% year-to-date in 2025, suggests that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the article does not provide overwhelmingly negative information about Apple, and the company's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions but generally lean towards a neutral or slightly negative outlook for Apple, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer retention may mitigate some negative impacts, the immediate concerns raised by the potential operational disruption and investor sentiment suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise due to Apple's financial stability, but the overall sentiment leans towards caution given the partnership concerns. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall."

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

While Jim Cramer defends Apple against criticisms of its post-Steve Jobs innovation, the article also highlights uncertainties surrounding its AI strategy and the broader market's reliance on tech stocks.  The mention of other AI stocks as potentially more lucrative investments indirectly suggests a less bullish outlook for Apple in the short term.  Previous predictions show significant divergence, reflecting a lack of strong consensus on the news' impact.  Some models emphasize Apple's strong financial health and debt management, leaning towards a price increase. Others focus on the uncertainty around AI and the overall market sentiment, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a major catalyst directly impacting Apple's fundamentals, a neutral stance is most appropriate. The probabilities reflect a balanced view, slightly favoring a price remaining stable or experiencing minor fluctuations rather than a significant rise or fall."

One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), where he defends the company against criticisms of lack of innovation post-Steve Jobs. While Cramer's defense is positive, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's AI strategy and iPhone sales momentum, with the stock down 4.3% year-to-date in 2025. The broader market context, including inflation and bond market reactions, is mentioned but does not directly impact Apple. Given the mixed sentiment and lack of significant positive or negative catalysts in the news, the stock price movement is likely to be neutral or slightly positive. Previous predictions from other models show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a neutral or slightly positive outlook. Therefore, the probabilities reflect a balanced view with a slight edge towards a rise due to Cramer's defense and Apple's overall strong market position."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

(AAPL). The article cites BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Gargi Chaudhuri, who expects the 493 other stocks to post an 11% earnings growth this year, faster than the 8% growth in 2024. Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024. Given this information, it seems that the article is bearish on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and bullish on the other S&P 500 stocks. This, combined with the fact that Apple's stock has already fallen 8% year-to-date in 2025, suggests that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the article does not provide overwhelmingly negative information about Apple, and the company's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact."

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While Apple has a strong reputation for innovation and customer retention, the immediate concerns raised by the potential operational disruption and investor sentiment suggest a higher probability of a stock price decline. Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a rise due to Apple's financial stability, but the overall sentiment leans towards caution given the partnership concerns. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall."

The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory.

While Jim Cramer's defense of Apple against innovation criticisms is positive, the article also highlights uncertainties surrounding Apple's AI strategy and the broader market's reliance on tech stocks.  The suggestion that other AI stocks might offer better returns indirectly hints at a less bullish outlook for Apple in the short term.  Previous predictions show significant divergence, reflecting a lack of strong consensus on the news' impact.  Some models emphasize Apple's strong financial health and debt management, leaning towards a price increase. Others focus on the uncertainty around AI and the overall market sentiment, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall or stagnation.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a major catalyst directly impacting Apple's fundamentals, a neutral stance is most appropriate. The probabilities reflect a balanced view, slightly favoring a price remaining stable or experiencing minor fluctuations rather than a significant rise or fall.  The consistent mention of Apple's strong financial position, however, prevents a strongly bearish prediction."

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P 500 stocks, excluding the 'Magnificent Seven' which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article cites BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Gargi Chaudhuri, who expects the 493 other stocks to post an 11% earnings growth this year, faster than the 8% growth in 2024. Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the fourth quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from the 25% pace in 2024. Given this information, it seems that the article is bearish on the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple, and bullish on the other S&P 500 stocks. This, combined with the fact that Apple's stock has already fallen 8% year-to-date in 2025, suggests that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling. However, the article does not provide overwhelmingly negative information about Apple, and the company's overall business strength and ability to adapt may mitigate some of the negative impact. Considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions but generally lean towards a neutral or slightly negative outlook for Apple, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be lower than the probability of it falling."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good.

David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel.

This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While Buffett has been reducing Berkshire Hathaway's stake in Apple, the article emphasizes that it remains Berkshire's largest holding.  The article also points to Apple's potential growth in the AI sector with its new AI-powered tools and processor chip development. However, the article also notes recent revenue stagnation and iPhone sales.  The overall tone is somewhat neutral, acknowledging both potential upsides and downsides.  Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a price fall, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be relatively small compared to other market factors."

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024.

The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting.

However, Apple's strong brand and innovation capabilities may mitigate negative impacts. For Goldman Sachs, the exit could be seen as positive as it removes a loss-making segment, allowing focus on more profitable areas. For Apple, the short-term disruption might cause some investor concern, but long-term prospects remain strong given its ability to pivot and find new partners. The probability of a stock price fall for Apple is slightly higher due to immediate concerns, while Goldman Sachs might see a neutral to slightly positive impact."

                                    "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good.

The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple's financial services ecosystem, which could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and potential to pivot to a new partner (e.g., JPMorgan Chase) may mitigate long-term risks. The immediate disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could lead to some investor concern, but Apple's overall resilience and ecosystem strength provide a counterbalance. Given the mixed implications, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so."

                                    "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The mention of other AI stocks potentially offering better returns adds caution. Overall, the sentiment is mixed, with a slight inclination towards a price rise due to Cramer's positive remarks and Apple's strong market position, but tempered by concerns about innovation and competition."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

However, the article also acknowledges concerns about Apple's AI capabilities and iPhone sales momentum, and the stock is down year-to-date. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight trend towards a more negative outlook. Considering the mixed signals and the company's ability to adapt, the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising, but not significantly so. The fact that other AI stocks are considered more promising also weighs on the outlook."

                                    "headline": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The article highlights both positive (Buffett's continued large holding, potential AI growth) and negative (revenue stagnation, iPhone sales slowdown, Berkshire's reduced stake) aspects of Apple.  The overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it's not company-specific news but rather a mention within a broader investment strategy piece.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and the influence of other market factors.  Given the lack of significant new information about Apple itself, and the mixed signals presented, I'm assigning probabilities close to neutral, slightly favoring a rise due to the continued presence in Buffett's portfolio, but acknowledging the potential for minimal impact overall."

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple's financial services ecosystem, which could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and potential to pivot to a new partner (e.g., JPMorgan Chase) may mitigate long-term risks. The immediate disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could lead to some investor concern, but Apple's overall resilience and ecosystem strength provide a counterbalance. Given the mixed implications and considering the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions, the estimated probabilities are based on a balanced view of the potential impact of this news on Apple's stock price."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good.

The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory.

Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy.

You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway.

The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article mentions Apple as one of Warren Buffett's holdings, but this is within a broader piece recommending several stocks.  The article highlights both positive (Buffett's continued large holding, potential AI growth) and negative (revenue stagnation, iPhone sales slowdown, Berkshire's reduced stake) aspects of Apple. The overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it's not company-specific news but rather a mention within a broader investment strategy piece.  The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and the influence of other market factors.  Given the lack of significant new information about Apple itself, and the mixed signals presented, the probabilities are close to neutral.  The slight lean towards a rise reflects Buffett's continued significant investment, but the overall impact of this news alone is likely to be small compared to other market forces.  The consensus from previous models shows a range from 0.3 to 0.55 for a price rise, and 0.45 to 0.7 for a price fall, indicating significant uncertainty. My prediction reflects a cautious optimism, acknowledging the mixed signals and the limited impact of this specific news."

                                    "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products.

Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies.

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good.

The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The article highlights both positive (Buffett's continued large holding, potential AI growth) and negative (revenue stagnation, iPhone sales slowdown, Berkshire's reduced stake) aspects of Apple. The overall impact of this news on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it's not company-specific news but rather a mention within a broader investment strategy piece. The previous predictions show a wide range, reflecting the inherent uncertainty and the influence of other market factors.  Given the lack of significant new information about Apple itself, and the mixed signals presented, the probabilities are close to neutral.  The slight lean towards a rise reflects Buffett's continued significant investment, but the overall impact of this news alone is likely to be small compared to other market forces.  The consensus from previous models shows a range from 0.3 to 0.55 for a price rise, and 0.45 to 0.7 for a price fall, indicating significant uncertainty. My prediction reflects a cautious optimism, acknowledging the mixed signals and the limited impact of this specific news.

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact.

                                    "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline suggests that investors should consider buying the 493 other S&P500 stocks instead of the 'Magnificent Seven' (Mag7), which includes Apple Inc. (AAPL). The article mentions that Mag7 stocks, including AAPL, are expected to experience a slowdown in earnings growth, while other sectors may see significant growth. Specifically, AAPL's stock is down 8% year to date, and high bond yields have negatively impacted Mag7 stocks. However, the article also highlights the potential for growth in other sectors, such as financials. Given this context, the news may have a slightly negative impact on Apple's stock price as investors consider alternatives with potentially better growth prospects at reasonable valuations."

                                    "headline": "Goldman Sachs Eyes Early Apple Card Exit -- What It Means for Investors and Apple's Ecosystem",
                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty for Apple's financial services ecosystem, which could negatively impact investor sentiment in the short term. However, Apple's strong brand, innovation capabilities, and potential to pivot to a new partner (e.g., JPMorgan Chase) may mitigate long-term risks. The immediate disruption to Apple Card and Savings products could lead to some investor concern, but Apple's overall resilience and ecosystem strength provide a counterbalance. Considering the mixed implications and the previous predictions from other models, which show a range of opinions, the estimated probabilities are based on a balanced view of the potential impact of this news on Apple's stock price."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

                                    "reasoning": "The article highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status. While it acknowledges stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, it also points out Buffett's potential strategic reasons for reducing Berkshire's stake and the company's significant investment in AI. The article mentions Apple's development of an AI-powered tool and a processor chip for AI data centers, aligning with the expected growth in the AI platform market. The overall tone is cautiously optimistic, suggesting potential for future growth driven by AI initiatives. However, the stagnant revenue and reduced stake by Berkshire introduce some uncertainty. Considering these factors, there's a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the AI potential, but the existing challenges temper the optimism."

Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025.

He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Warren Buffett's stock picks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), and highlights the company's potential for growth in the AI arena. Although Apple's revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, and Berkshire Hathaway has been paring back its stake in the company, the article suggests that Apple may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. The launch of an AI-powered tool and the development of a processor chip for AI data centers are seen as positive developments. However, the article also notes that the company's place in the AI arena is not yet clear. Given these mixed signals, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. While it highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick and mentions its potential for growth in the AI sector, it also acknowledges stagnant revenue, declining iPhone sales, and Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its Apple stake.  The positive aspects include Apple's foray into AI with a new AI-powered tool and the development of an AI processor chip. However, the negative aspects, particularly the reduction in Berkshire's stake, raise concerns about investor confidence.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise due to AI potential and others predicting a fall due to stagnant revenue and reduced Berkshire holdings. Considering the mixed signals and the overall uncertainty, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the potential upside from AI, but acknowledging the significant countervailing factors. The fact that this is a list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1000 suggests a generally positive sentiment, but not overwhelmingly so."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products.

                                    "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(AAPL), with Jim Cramer defending the company's innovation record and highlighting its strong stock performance. Despite mentioning concerns about innovation post-Steve Jobs, the overall tone is supportive of the company. The news also notes positive trends in the market and the stock's performance since the WWDC conference. However, it mentions investor uncertainty regarding AI integration and iPhone sales. Given the generally positive stance and historical performance of the stock, the impact of negative sentiments appears to be outweighed."

Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with many leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall due to concerns about stagnant revenue, reduced stake by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential shifts in investor focus. While some predictions highlight Apple's AI initiatives as a positive factor, the overall tone of the news is cautionary, leading to a higher likelihood of a price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies.

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points.

(AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news covers mixed sentiments towards Apple Inc. (AAPL). Jim Cramer defends the company's innovation record and highlights its strong stock performance since the WWDC conference. Despite concerns about innovation post-Steve Jobs and investor uncertainty regarding AI integration and iPhone sales, the overall tone is supportive. Several previous predictions show a range of opinions, but many lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to AI potential and Apple's strong brand. The current news does not strongly indicate a significant shift in sentiment, but it does highlight ongoing investor uncertainty."

                                    "reasoning": "The headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple Inc. (AAPL), indicating potential downward pressure on the stock price. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with many leaning towards a higher probability of a price fall due to concerns about stagnant revenue, reduced stake by Berkshire Hathaway, and potential shifts in investor focus. While some predictions highlight Apple's AI initiatives as a positive factor, the overall tone of the news is cautionary, leading to a higher likelihood of a price decline. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, coupled with Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its stake, introduce considerable uncertainty. The AI initiatives are promising, but their impact on the near-term stock price is unclear. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with a slight trend towards a more optimistic outlook in the most recent round. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative news, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the potential upside from AI and the overall positive sentiment associated with being a Buffett pick. However, the current market challenges and uncertainty temper this optimism. The fact that the headline is about Warren Buffet stocks to buy suggests a positive sentiment, but the content of the article is more nuanced."

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's featured as a Warren Buffett pick, highlighting its enduring brand and potential in AI, which is a positive signal. However, stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, coupled with Berkshire Hathaway's reduction of its stake, introduce considerable uncertainty. While the article suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction and highlights Apple's AI initiatives, the negative aspects cannot be ignored. Previous predictions are mixed, with a slight trend towards a more optimistic outlook in the most recent round, but with significant variance. Considering these factors, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the potential upside from AI, but acknowledging the significant countervailing factors. The fact that the headline is about Warren Buffet stocks to buy suggests a positive sentiment, but the content of the article is more nuanced. Given the trend of previous predictions, I will slightly decrease the probability of stock price rising."

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

                                    "headline": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the potential exit of Goldman Sachs from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial services offerings. This could negatively impact user experience and loyalty, at least in the short term. The reliance on Goldman for backend support means a partner swap could be complex and potentially costly. On the other hand, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer focus, suggesting they are likely to manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could provide a stable alternative. The overall impact on Apple's core business is likely to be limited, as the Apple Card is a relatively small part of their overall revenue. Given Apple's resilience and ability to adapt, the negative impact is likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, the article also notes that Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its Apple stake recently, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence.

The mention of Buffett's investment is positive, but the reduction in Berkshire's holdings introduces uncertainty. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is considered moderate, while the probability of a fall is relatively low, reflecting the overall mixed signals in the news."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial services that rely on Goldman. This could disrupt user experience and loyalty, leading to a potential decline in stock price. However, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty suggests that they may manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, while there is a higher risk of a stock price decline due to this news, Apple's robust fundamentals may limit the extent of the fall. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While it highlights Apple as a 'timeless stalwart', it also notes that Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its Apple stake. This reduction, although potentially strategic, introduces uncertainty.  The article mentions Apple's foray into AI as a potential positive, but also points out stagnant revenue and iPhone sales.  The overall tone regarding Apple's recent performance is mixed.  Considering the previous predictions, which range widely from a 30% to 55% probability of a price rise, and the mixed signals in the article itself, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, reflecting the potential for AI-driven growth to outweigh the concerns about stagnant revenue and reduced Berkshire holdings.  However, the uncertainty remains significant, preventing a strong prediction in either direction."

The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks due to potentially more favorable valuations and earnings growth in sectors like financials. The article mentions that Apple's stock is already down 8% year to date, indicating negative sentiment. Additionally, higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations could further pressure tech stocks like Apple. Considering the trend of others' predictions, which mostly indicate a higher probability of the stock price falling, and taking into account the current market sentiment and potential shift in investor focus, I estimate a lower probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

However, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty suggests that they may manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, while there is a higher risk of a stock price decline due to this news, Apple's robust fundamentals may limit the extent of the fall. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While this is generally positive, the article also notes that Berkshire has been reducing its Apple stake recently, a potentially bearish signal.  The article mentions Apple's foray into AI as a potential future growth driver, but also points out recent stagnation in revenue and iPhone sales.  The overall tone is mixed.  Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to concerns about the Goldman Sachs partnership, a shift in investor focus away from tech giants, and the overall market sentiment.  However, other models highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and potential for growth in AI. Considering the mixed signals and the history of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, reflecting the potential for AI-driven growth and the overall positive association with Warren Buffett's investment, while acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the recent reduction in Berkshire's holdings and the mixed recent performance of the company."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This is generally positive, suggesting a degree of confidence from a renowned investor. However, the article also notes that Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its Apple stake, a potentially bearish signal.  The article mentions Apple's foray into AI as a potential future growth driver, but also points out recent stagnation in revenue and iPhone sales. The overall tone is mixed.  Previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, with a slight tendency towards a price fall due to concerns about the Goldman Sachs partnership, a potential shift in investor focus away from tech giants, and the overall market sentiment.  However, other models highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and potential for growth in AI.  Considering the mixed signals and the history of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, reflecting the potential for AI-driven growth and the overall positive association with Warren Buffett's investment, while acknowledging the uncertainty surrounding the recent reduction in Berkshire's holdings and the mixed recent performance of the company. The fact that the article is about Buffett's picks and includes Apple is a positive factor, but the reduction in Berkshire's holdings and the mixed recent performance of Apple temper this positivity.  The overall sentiment remains uncertain."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

The news article also indicates that Apple has a robust balance sheet and has successfully navigated challenges in the past. However, the previous round predictions show a consistent trend of pessimism towards Apple's stock performance, influenced by factors such as the shift in investor focus away from major tech stocks and concerns around potential disruptions in financial services offerings. Considering the positive news about Apple's debt management and the mixed signals from previous predictions, the probability of stock price rise is slightly higher than in previous rounds but still cautious."

This could disrupt user experience and loyalty, leading to a potential decline in stock price. However, Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty suggests that they may manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could mitigate some negative impacts. Overall, while there is a higher risk of a stock price decline due to this news, Apple's robust fundamentals may limit the extent of the fall. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise, but not overwhelmingly so."

While Apple's brand strength and history of successful transitions offer some reassurance, the potential disruption to user experience and the need for a new partner create a short-term negative outlook. Previous predictions have consistently leaned towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, reflecting concerns about the impact on Apple's financial products and a broader shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. Although Apple's fundamentals remain strong, the immediate impact of this news is likely to be negative. I am slightly increasing the probability of a rise compared to the last round, as the negative news is already priced in, and Apple's ability to adapt is a strong factor. However, the negative sentiment surrounding the Apple Card situation seems to be weighing more heavily on the predictions."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article focuses on Warren Buffett's stock picks, mentioning Apple as one of them.  This is generally positive, suggesting a degree of confidence from a renowned investor. However, the article also notes that Berkshire Hathaway has been reducing its Apple stake, which introduces uncertainty.  The article highlights Apple's potential growth in AI but also points out stagnant revenue and iPhone sales.  The overall tone is mixed. Previous predictions show a wide range, with a slight tendency towards a price fall due to concerns about the Goldman Sachs partnership, a potential shift in investor focus away from tech giants, and overall market sentiment.  However, other models highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and potential for growth in AI. Considering the mixed signals and the history of previous predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, reflecting the potential for AI-driven growth and the positive association with Warren Buffett's investment.  The reduction in Berkshire's holdings and mixed recent performance temper this positivity. The overall sentiment remains uncertain, but the inclusion of Apple in Buffett's picks provides a slight positive bias."

                                    "reasoning": "The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' stocks, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), towards other S&P 500 stocks due to potentially more favorable valuations and earnings growth in sectors like financials. The article highlights that Apple's stock is already down 8% year to date, indicating negative sentiment. Additionally, higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations could further pressure tech stocks like Apple. However, Apple's strong fundamentals and history of navigating challenges may mitigate the extent of the fall. Considering the trend of others' predictions and the mixed signals from the article, I estimate a moderate probability of the stock price rising and a higher probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

This suggests strong financial health and operational efficiency, which generally positively impacts investor confidence. The news article also indicates that Apple has a robust balance sheet and has successfully navigated challenges in the past.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling.

Goldman Sachs' struggles with the Apple Card are primarily their problem, not Apple's. Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected.

When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

The article emphasizes that Apple has a strong ability to cover its interest expenses, with an EBIT covering interest 673 times over, and a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31. Additionally, Apple's free cash flow is robust, amounting to 90% of its EBIT, which positions it well to manage its debt. The overall tone of the article is positive, suggesting that Apple's financial health is strong and its use of debt is conservative and strategic.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price rising, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger."

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early is a relatively minor event for Apple in the long term. While there might be short-term market reaction due to uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected.  The article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and find a new partner, minimizing the risk of significant negative impact.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models emphasizing the potential negative impact (0.2 rise, 0.8 fall) and others highlighting Apple's resilience (0.6 rise, 0.4 fall).  Considering Apple's overall market position and history of successfully navigating challenges, the probability of a stock price fall is likely to be lower than the probability of a rise, although the impact is likely to be relatively small. The fact that a potential replacement (JPMorgan Chase) is already mentioned further mitigates the risk.  The overall sentiment leans slightly positive, but the impact is likely to be muted given the scale of Apple's operations."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While there's potential for short-term market volatility due to uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, the impact is unlikely to be significant.  Apple's ability to find a new partner (JPMorgan Chase is mentioned) mitigates the risk.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting Apple's resilience and strong core business.

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products.

You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late.

Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While it could cause short-term market volatility and some minor disruption to Apple Card users, Apple's core business remains strong and largely unaffected.  The mention of JPMorgan Chase as a potential replacement partner further mitigates the risk of significant long-term negative impact.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, but the majority lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, reflecting Apple's resilience and strong market position.  The negative sentiment expressed in some headlines is not directly related to Apple's core business and is likely to be overshadowed by the company's overall positive outlook.  However, the uncertainty surrounding the partnership change could lead to some short-term downward pressure.  Considering all factors, a slightly higher probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for short-term fluctuations."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange).

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article provides a detailed analysis of Apple's conservative use of debt, highlighting its strong financial health, robust free cash flow, and ability to cover interest expenses with an EBIT covering interest 673 times over. The article emphasizes Apple's low net debt to EBITDA ratio of 0.31 and its strategic use of debt, which is likely to be viewed favorably by investors. The overall tone of the article is positive, suggesting that Apple's financial health is strong and its use of debt is prudent. Considering the previous predictions, which mostly lean towards a positive outlook, and the strong financial indicators presented in the news, the probability of the stock price rising is higher than that of it falling."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024.

The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting.

However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models agree that the impact on Apple's stock price will be limited. The overall sentiment leans slightly positive, but the impact is likely to be relatively small given the scale of Apple's operations. Given the mixed signals and the overall positive framing of Apple's prospects despite cautionary notes, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise."

While revenue has been stagnant and Berkshire has reduced its stake, the article suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction and highlights Apple's significant investment in AI, a rapidly growing market. The article also mentions that Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined. This positive sentiment, coupled with the AI initiatives, suggests a slightly higher probability of a stock price rise. However, the stagnant revenue and stake reduction temper the optimism, leading to a more balanced probability assessment."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange).

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman. This potential disruption could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. While Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty may help mitigate the impact, the immediate reaction from investors is likely to be cautious. The previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to the uncertainty introduced by the news. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

This positive assessment of Apple's financial strength is unlikely to significantly impact the stock price in the short term, given Apple's already established market position and the generally positive sentiment surrounding the company.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article primarily discusses Jim Cramer's comments on various topics, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), but does not provide any significant new information or catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price. Cramer defends Apple's innovation post-Steve Jobs, but the discussion is more about broader market trends and other companies like TikTok and Elon Musk's ventures. The article mentions Apple's mixed performance in the AI era and a slight year-to-date decline, but these are not new developments. Given the lack of concrete positive or negative news specific to Apple, the impact on the stock price is likely neutral. Therefore, the probabilities of a rise or fall in Apple's stock price due to this news are balanced and minimal."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in?

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

This potential disruption could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. While Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty may help mitigate the impact, the immediate reaction from investors is likely to be cautious. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with some leaning towards a negative outlook due to the uncertainty introduced by the news.

Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The article presents a mixed outlook for Apple. On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status and potential in the AI arena. Berkshire Hathaway maintains a significant stake in Apple, although they have reduced it recently. On the negative side, revenue has been stagnant, and the article mentions the stake reduction. However, it also suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction. The previous predictions are varied, with some leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the Buffett endorsement, the AI potential, and the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise. However, the stagnant revenue and stake reduction temper the optimism, leading to a more balanced probability assessment. The 'Double Down' advertisement within the article also suggests a positive outlook, although it should be taken with a grain of salt as it is promotional material."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Key metrics like a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage are highlighted, suggesting strong financial stability. While the article mentions unspecified warning signs, the overall tone is positive.  However, this positive news is unlikely to significantly move Apple's stock price in the short term given its size and established market position. The news is not exceptionally bullish or bearish.

Considering the mixed signals and the limited impact of this specific news on a large-cap stock like Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the positive financial health indicators but acknowledging the overall limited impact of this news."

Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

This potential disruption could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. While Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty may help mitigate the impact, the immediate reaction from investors is likely to be cautious. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with many leaning towards a negative outlook due to the uncertainty introduced by the news. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, presenting a positive aspect of its financial health.  Key metrics like a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage are highlighted, suggesting strong financial stability.  However, this positive news is unlikely to significantly move Apple's stock price in the short term given its size and established market position. The news is not exceptionally bullish or bearish.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall.  Considering the mixed signals and the limited impact of this specific news on a large-cap stock like Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the positive financial health indicators but acknowledging the overall limited impact of this news.  The lack of any significantly negative news, coupled with the generally positive sentiment surrounding Apple, tips the balance slightly towards a rise, but the impact is likely to be minimal."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Considering the positive sentiment from being a Warren Buffett pick and the potential for growth in AI, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is higher than the probability of it falling.

Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs considering an early exit from the Apple Card partnership introduces significant uncertainty for Apple, particularly regarding its financial products that rely on Goldman. This potential disruption could negatively impact user sentiment and, consequently, stock performance. While Apple's strong reputation for innovation and customer loyalty may help mitigate the impact, the immediate reaction from investors is likely to be cautious. Previous predictions show a range of sentiments, with many leaning towards a negative outlook due to the uncertainty introduced by the news. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

On the positive side, it highlights Apple as a Warren Buffett pick, emphasizing its 'timeless stalwart' status and potential in the AI arena. Berkshire Hathaway maintains a significant stake in Apple, although they have reduced it recently. The article also mentions Apple's AI initiatives and the potential for growth in that sector. On the negative side, revenue has been stagnant, and the article mentions the stake reduction. However, it also suggests strategic reasons for the stake reduction. Considering the Buffett endorsement, the AI potential, and the overall positive sentiment surrounding Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise. However, the stagnant revenue and stake reduction temper the optimism, leading to a more balanced probability assessment. The previous predictions show a trend of increasing optimism, which I will also consider. Given the trend of previous predictions, I will slightly increase the probability of stock price rising."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article focuses on Apple's conservative debt management, presenting a positive view of its financial health.  Key financial indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio and high interest coverage are highlighted, suggesting strong financial stability. This is generally positive news. However, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal in the short term given its size and established market position. The news is not exceptionally bullish or bearish.  Previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions, with probabilities of a price rise ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 and probabilities of a price fall ranging from 0.35 to 0.8.  Considering the mixed signals and the limited impact of this specific news on a large-cap stock like Apple, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the positive financial health indicators but acknowledging the overall limited impact of this news. The consistent slight upward trend in the predictions of stock price rise across rounds also contributes to this assessment.  The uncertainty surrounding the Goldman Sachs Apple Card partnership is a separate factor not directly addressed in this article and could influence the stock price independently."

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

While Cramer does not provide any significant new information or catalysts that would directly impact Apple's stock price, his positive remarks about Apple's potential in AI and its strong financial position could mitigate the negative sentiment. However, considering the mixed performance of Apple in the AI era and the slight year-to-date decline, the probabilities seem to reflect a cautious optimism. Given Cramer's positive comments and Apple's strong brand, there seems to be a slightly higher chance of the stock price rising compared to falling."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024.

The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best.

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership, highlighting Goldman's financial losses and regulatory issues with the venture. While this might initially seem negative for Apple, the article suggests Apple is likely to find a replacement partner and maintain the functionality of its financial services.  The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be muted because: 1) Apple's core business is not directly tied to the Apple Card's profitability; 2) Apple has a strong track record of adapting to changes; 3) the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's.  A partner change might cause temporary uncertainty, but Apple's overall financial health and brand strength are unlikely to be significantly affected. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than the probability of a fall, reflecting a neutral to slightly positive outlook."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality.

The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, it also notes recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire's stake, indicating some caution among investors. The mention of Apple's efforts in AI could serve as a positive catalyst for future growth, but the overall sentiment remains mixed due to the company's recent performance issues. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but with significant caution reflected in the probabilities."

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

While there might be short-term uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong brand, ecosystem, and ability to find a new partner (potentially JPMorgan Chase) mitigate the risk.  The news focuses on Goldman's financial struggles, not Apple's core business strength.  Previous predictions are mixed, ranging from 0.3 to 0.7 probability of a price rise. Considering the relatively minor impact on Apple's overall business and its history of successfully navigating such changes, a neutral to slightly positive outlook is warranted. The market's reaction is likely to be muted, with the probability of a price rise slightly higher than a price fall."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models agree that the impact on Apple's stock price will be muted. Therefore, the probability of the stock price falling is estimated to be lower than the probability of the stock price rising, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The core Apple business remains unaffected.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models lean towards a muted impact on Apple's stock price, with a slight bias towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and resilience.  The fact that the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's, further supports a neutral to slightly positive outlook.

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc. (AAPL), including his defense of the company's innovation post-Steve Jobs and its integration worldwide with Apple devices. However, the article also mentions mixed performance in the AI era and concerns about iPhone sales momentum. Cramer's comments are somewhat supportive, but the broader context includes uncertainty about Apple's ability to sustain growth and innovation, which could influence investor sentiment. The previous predictions show a mix of slightly positive to neutral outlooks, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Apple's strong financials and potential for AI integration. Overall, the news is neutral with a slight positive tilt due to Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation and the company's robust financial position."

It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

Additionally, rising bond yields have rattled investors in these high-growth tech stocks. However, Apple's specific prospects are not directly criticized in the article. The overall sentiment seems to favor diversification and exploring other sectors beyond tech, which could lead to a relatively neutral to slightly negative outlook for AAPL in the short term. Considering the mixed sentiment and the current market trends, and taking into account the previous predictions which show a varied but generally cautious outlook, I estimate a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising compared to falling."

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models agree that the impact on Apple's stock price will be muted. The overall sentiment seems to favor a neutral to slightly positive outlook for AAPL, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The distribution of predictions in the previous rounds indicates significant uncertainty. Considering the negative headline and the mixed signals from the previous predictions, I will slightly favor a fall, but not overwhelmingly, as Apple is a resilient company. The negative headline is a strong signal, but the diverse opinions in previous rounds suggest that the market's reaction might not be uniformly negative. I am also giving slightly more weight to the models that predicted a fall in the previous rounds."

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024.

While there's potential for short-term uncertainty and minor disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong brand, vast ecosystem, and ability to secure a new partner (potentially JPMorgan Chase) mitigate the risk significantly. The core Apple business remains unaffected.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models lean towards a muted impact on Apple's stock price, with a slight bias towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and resilience. The fact that the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's, further supports a neutral to slightly positive outlook. Considering the limited direct impact on Apple's financials and its history of successfully navigating similar situations, a price rise is slightly more likely than a fall. However, the uncertainty introduced by the partnership change warrants a probability less than 0.6 for a price rise.  The consistent near-neutral predictions across multiple rounds and models suggest the market largely anticipates a minimal impact on AAPL's stock price."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The previous predictions show a mix of slightly positive to neutral outlooks, with some models leaning towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Apple's strong financials and potential for AI integration. Overall, the news is neutral with a slight positive tilt due to Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation and the company's robust financial position."

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news highlights Apple's conservative approach to debt management, noting that it has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio and strong interest coverage. The news also points out that Apple has robust free cash flow, which further supports its financial stability. These factors suggest that the company is in a strong financial position, reducing risk and potentially increasing investor confidence. Although previous predictions have shown mixed sentiments, the overall positive framing of Apple's financial health and its ability to manage debt effectively indicates a lower risk and more stable stock performance."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The distribution of predictions in the previous rounds indicates significant uncertainty. However, the negative headline is a strong signal that cannot be ignored.

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs' potential exit from the Apple Card partnership is primarily negative for Goldman Sachs, but its impact on Apple is likely to be minimal and short-lived.  While there's potential for short-term uncertainty and minor disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong brand, vast ecosystem, and ability to secure a new partner (potentially JPMorgan Chase) mitigate the risk significantly. The core Apple business remains unaffected.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but most models lean towards a muted impact on Apple's stock price, with a slight bias towards a rise due to Apple's overall strength and resilience. The fact that the news focuses on Goldman's problems, not Apple's, further supports a neutral to slightly positive outlook.  Considering the limited direct impact on Apple's financials and its history of successfully navigating similar situations, a price rise is slightly more likely than a fall. However, the uncertainty introduced by the partnership change warrants a probability less than 0.6 for a price rise. The consistent near-neutral predictions across multiple rounds and models suggest the market largely anticipates a minimal impact on AAPL's stock price.  I'm giving slightly more weight to the consistent near-neutral predictions across multiple rounds and models, suggesting the market largely anticipates a minimal impact on AAPL's stock price.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

The article highlights that the Mag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from their 25% pace in 2024. Additionally, rising bond yields have rattled investors in these high-growth tech stocks. However, Apple's specific prospects are not directly criticized in the article. The overall sentiment seems to favor diversification and exploring other sectors beyond tech, which could lead to a relatively neutral to slightly negative outlook for AAPL in the short term. Considering the mixed sentiment and the current market trends, and taking into account the previous predictions which show a varied but generally cautious outlook, I estimate a slightly lower probability of the stock price rising compared to falling."

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership may have a short-term negative impact on Apple's stock price due to the uncertainty and potential disruption to its Apple Card and Savings products. However, Apple's history of innovation and ability to adapt to changes suggests that the company may be able to mitigate the impact and potentially find a new partner, such as JPMorgan Chase, to support its financial products. Additionally, the news does not appear to have a significant impact on Apple's core business, and the company's ecosystem and user base are likely to remain intact. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but most models agree that the impact on Apple's stock price will be muted. The overall sentiment seems to favor a neutral to slightly positive outlook for AAPL, as the market may react positively to Apple's potential ability to navigate this change and emerge stronger."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Cramer's dismissal of the claim that Apple's innovation has stagnated since Steve Jobs' death is mildly positive for Apple. However, the article also highlights Cramer's preference for AI stocks and suggests that other companies might offer better returns in the short term.  The overall tone is neutral to slightly positive regarding Apple, but not overwhelmingly so. The broader market context discussed (inflation, bond market behavior) is largely irrelevant to Apple's specific stock movement in response to this news. Therefore, the probability of a price increase is slightly higher than the probability of a price decrease, but the impact of this news alone is likely to be minimal."

                                    "headline": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, it also points out recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which may raise concerns. The mention of Apple's potential growth in the AI sector could serve as a positive catalyst, but the overall sentiment appears mixed due to the company's recent performance. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising, but with significant caution due to the negative indicators."

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation is mildly positive, but his preference for AI stocks and the overall market context (inflation, bond yields) are largely neutral to slightly negative for Apple.  The article doesn't present any strong bullish or bearish catalysts specific to Apple.  Considering the previous predictions, there's a divergence of opinion. Some models highlight Apple's strong fundamentals and potential in AI, while others emphasize concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus.  The lack of a significant positive or negative catalyst in this news, coupled with the mixed predictions from other models, suggests a relatively neutral outlook.  Therefore, the probabilities are weighted slightly towards a price rise, reflecting the mildly positive sentiment from Cramer's comments, but acknowledging the overall uncertainty."

Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025.

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products.

Considering the previous predictions, there is a slight tilt towards a price rise due to the positive framing of Apple as a Buffett stock, despite the concerns raised about its recent performance."

                                    "reasoning": "The news article suggests a shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. It highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date and that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down. Rising bond yields are also mentioned as negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. However, the trend seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook for Apple. Therefore, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect this increased probability of a price decrease."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news piece centers around Jim Cramer's comments on Apple and the broader market.  While Cramer defends Apple against claims of innovation stagnation, this is a relatively weak positive.  The article also highlights his preference for AI stocks, suggesting potentially better returns elsewhere.  The macroeconomic factors discussed (inflation, bond yields) are largely irrelevant to Apple's specific reaction to this news.  Previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, with some models emphasizing Apple's strong fundamentals and AI potential, while others highlight concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus.  The lack of a strong catalyst in this news, combined with the mixed predictions, suggests a neutral outlook.  However, the slight positive sentiment from Cramer's comments, coupled with Apple's generally strong position, gives a marginal edge to a price rise.  The overall uncertainty and mixed signals from previous predictions lead to probabilities closer to 0.5 than to extreme values."

                                    "headline": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It highlights that Apple's growth is expected to slow down, and the stock has already experienced an 8% decline year-to-date. Additionally, rising bond yields have negatively impacted the Mag7 names, including Apple. However, some models also consider Apple's strong fundamentals, its foray into AI, and its position as a recommended stock by Warren Buffett, which could support a price rise. The overall sentiment appears mixed, but with a cautious or negative outlook for Apple in the short term. Considering these factors, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news piece is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price movement.  Jim Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation counters the narrative of stagnation, offering a mildly positive sentiment. However, this is tempered by his preference for AI stocks and the overall market uncertainties discussed (inflation, bond yields).  The previous predictions show significant divergence, with probabilities ranging from 0.2 to 0.75 for a price rise. This wide range reflects the lack of a strong, decisive catalyst in the news itself.  The overall financial health of Apple, as indicated by its debt management and cash flow, is a positive factor. However, concerns about slowing growth and a potential shift in investor focus towards other sectors remain. Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a strong directional influence from the news, I'm assigning probabilities closer to a neutral stance, slightly favoring a price rise due to Apple's generally strong fundamentals and Cramer's mild defense of its innovation."

                                    "content": "Got an extra $1,000 you would like to put to work but don't quite know how? Don't make it complicated. Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

Some models cited specific reasons such as the potential slowdown in earnings growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' and Apple's recent underperformance. However, a few models presented a more positive outlook based on Apple's strong fundamentals and potential in AI. Given the negative tone of the headline and the overall trend in previous predictions, I infer that the probability of the stock price falling is higher than the probability of it rising. The mixed sentiment among the models, with some emphasizing positive factors like Apple's innovation and financial stability, while others highlight concerns about growth and investor focus, leads to a balanced but cautious outlook. Therefore, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be less than 0.5, reflecting the overall negative sentiment and trend towards a potential decline."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

Just poach a pick or two (or several) from one of the world's best-known and most-proven stock pickers. He's Warren Buffett, of course. There's a reason he has been able to reliably lead Berkshire Hathaway to market-beating performances.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three of Berkshire's holdings that are solid prospects for you at this time, in no particular order.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested Buffett pick that it has almost become a clich\u00e9. Nevertheless, there's good reason Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) continues to be highlighted as a stock you might want to own, too.\n\nNot only is its namesake cola woven into the world's cultural fabric, but its other well-known brands like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Dasani water, and Powerade sports drinks (to name just a few) also mean this beverage behemoth always has something to sell regardless of consumers' ever-changing tastes.\n\nThat doesn't mean things are always easy. Coke shares have fallen 16% from their early September high in response to a small but alarming drop in the total amount of product sold (as measured by volume) during the company's fiscal third quarter of last year.\n\nOperating income and net earnings fell even more during the three-month stretch, with no indication that the headwind was likely to abate during the quarter ending in December.\n\nThis is a timeless business, though, and Coke's brands seem just as timeless. You'll simply need to give this stock enough time for the company to prove it's worth the wait.\n\nBuffett has certainly done so anyway. Berkshire began amassing its current 400 million shares in late 1998. The stock has nearly doubled in value since then, while the dividend -- perhaps the chief reason Buffett's such a fan -- has more than tripled during this time, extending an annual growth streak of 62 years.\n\nNewcomers will be stepping in while the forward-looking dividend yield stands at just under 3.2%.\n\nApple\n\nJust as much as Coca-Cola, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a frequently suggested Buffett pick. And as with Coke, that's for a good reason. Apple is another one of those timeless stalwarts with a well-deserved reputation for performance.\n\nThat's not necessarily been easy to believe of late. Revenue has been stagnant since mid-2022, while sales of its flagship iPhone (as measured by revenue as well as unit sales) have been just as stagnant for just as long.\n\nStory Continues\n\nAAPL revenue (TTM), data by YCharts; TTM = trailing 12 months.\n\nBuffett and his lieutenants have also been paring back the size of Berkshire's stake in Apple of late, shedding roughly 600 million shares just since early last year. It certainly doesn't seem like a vote of confidence.\n\nJust keep things in perspective. Berkshire Hathaway's position in Apple had grown to enormous proportions -- even by Buffett's liberal standards -- at a time when it looked like unrealized stock gains might become subject to income taxation. He may have simply been thinking strategically.\n\nAnd either way, Berkshire's $70 billion stake in Apple is still its single biggest position, accounting for about one-fourth the value of all the conglomerate's total stock holdings combined.\n\nThe company may be on the cusp of significant and prolonged growth. Near the end of last year, Apple launched an AI-powered tool that is run directly from its newer devices. That is as opposed to being run in the cloud, as most similar platforms like ChatGPT or Alphabet's Gemini typically are at this time. Apple is also developing a processor chip that could power its own artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.\n\nIt's not exactly clear where or what Apple's place in the ever-changing AI arena is. But given IDC's expectation that the worldwide AI platform market will grow at an annual pace of more than 40% through 2028, the company\u00a0isn't wrong to throw its hat into the ring and capture whatever growth it can.\n\nBYD\n\nLastly, add BYD(OTC: BYDD.F) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to buy with $1,000 right now. If the name doesn't ring a bell, you might be more familiar with it than you realize. The electric vehicle (EV) company has been outselling industry-leader Tesla from time to time since late 2023.\n\nAlthough BYD makes other things, most of its top line comes from its affordable EVs and related products. It's also one of a small handful of foreign stocks that the typically pro-USA Buffett likes, and the only Chinese stock among Berkshire's current holdings.\n\nThis is telling in and of itself -- but not necessarily surprising in light of BYD's past and projected growth. Even in the midst of global economic lethargy (particularly in and around China), this company's top line is expected to grow by 24% for the entirety of 2024, followed by revenue growth of nearly 21% for the fiscal year now underway.\n\nThis pace of growth could persist for a long, long while, too. Although U.S. consumers' euphoria regarding EVs is cooling, actual global demand is still growing and is likely to continue doing so.\n\nBloombergNEF, which tracks the lower-carbon economy, predicts total worldwide sales of EVs are going to nearly double their current levels by 2027, reaching 30 million units, en route to annual sales of 73 million in 2040. As BYD ventures further and further outside of its home turf during this stretch (perhaps eventually including the United States?), look for it to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nAnd don't worry about BYD's over-the-counter listing (as opposed to a more conventional listing on an exchange). With a $100 billion market capitalization, it's not your usual OTC stock.\n\nSecuring U.S. exchange-based stock listings can be a logistical hassle as well as needlessly costly for many foreign companies. It's certainly not a problem for Buffett and Berkshire, which presently hold nearly $2 billion worth of this over-the-counter ticker.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, it also points out recent stagnation in revenue and a reduction in Berkshire Hathaway's stake, which may raise concerns. The mention of Apple's potential growth in the AI sector could serve as a positive catalyst, but the overall sentiment appears mixed due to the company's recent performance. Considering the previous predictions, there is a slight tilt towards a price rise due to the positive framing of Apple as a Buffett stock, despite the concerns raised about its recent performance."

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article suggests a potential shift in investor focus away from the 'Magnificent Seven' (including Apple) towards other S&P 500 stocks. It highlights that Apple is already down 8% year-to-date and that the Mag 7's growth is expected to slow down. Rising bond yields are also mentioned as negatively impacting the Mag 7. While the article doesn't explicitly predict a stock price fall, the overall tone and specific mentions of Apple's underperformance and potential headwinds suggest a higher probability of a price decrease than an increase in the short term. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall. However, the trend seems to be shifting towards a more negative outlook for Apple. Therefore, I'm adjusting my prediction to reflect this increased probability of a price decrease. The fact that Apple is down 8% YTD is a significant factor. The slowing growth of the Mag 7 is also a concern. The rising bond yields are another negative factor. While Apple has strong fundamentals, the market sentiment seems to be shifting away from it."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

                                    "reasoning": "The news piece is largely neutral regarding Apple's stock price movement. Jim Cramer's defense of Apple's innovation is a mildly positive factor, but this is countered by his preference for AI stocks and the broader market uncertainties (inflation, bond yields).  Previous predictions show significant divergence, reflecting the lack of a strong catalyst in the news. Apple's financial health (debt management, cash flow) is positive, but concerns about slowing growth and a potential investor shift towards other sectors remain.  The overall sentiment is mixed, with no clear dominant factor pushing the price significantly up or down.  Considering the mixed signals and the lack of a strong directional influence from the news, I'm assigning probabilities close to a neutral stance, slightly favoring a price rise due to Apple's generally strong fundamentals and Cramer's mild defense of its innovation. The consistent near-equal probabilities across multiple rounds of predictions from various models further supports this neutral outlook."

On the negative side, the article notes stagnant revenue and iPhone sales, as well as Berkshire Hathaway reducing its stake in Apple, which could signal caution and potentially lead to a price fall. The overall tone is balanced but leans slightly positive due to the long-term growth potential in AI.

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed bag for Apple. On one hand, the potential exit of Goldman Sachs from the Apple Card partnership introduces uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple's financial services offerings. This could negatively impact user experience and loyalty, at least in the short term. The reliance on Goldman for backend support means a partner swap could be complex and potentially costly. On the other hand, Apple has a strong track record of innovation and customer focus, suggesting they are likely to manage the transition effectively. The potential for JPMorgan Chase to step in as a replacement could provide a stable alternative. The overall impact on Apple's core business is likely to be limited, as the Apple Card is a relatively small part of their overall revenue. Given Apple's resilience and ability to adapt, the negative impact is likely to be short-lived. Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but not significantly so."

                                    "content": "Listen and subscribe to Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube or wherever you find your favorite podcasts.\n\nTime for investors to have a wider stock screener.\n\nThe so-called \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d inside the S&P 500 have crowded out headlines and investor thought schools for the past year amid explosive hype around AI and profit growth. But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck? Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang: Masayoshi Son is recasting himself into an AI player with his $100 billion bet\n\nIn addition to seeking quality and growth, \u201cwe\u2019re talking about this concept of growth at a reasonable price,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cWe look at strong, healthy balance sheets, low leverage, and companies that are really able to have repetitive earnings growth.\u201d\n\nIn some respects, buying the S&P 500's 493 other stocks at reasonable valuations may be a sort of defensive trade in the current environment.\n\nThe latest jobs report sent stocks on a downward spiral. Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

(AAPL), specifically his response to the notion that there has been no innovation since Steve Jobs' death. Cramer finds this statement 'inflammatory' and highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. While the article does not contain overwhelmingly positive or negative news about Apple's stock performance, Cramer's defense of the company's innovation suggests a neutral to slightly positive outlook. However, the overall impact of this news on the stock price is likely to be limited as it does not provide any significant new information about Apple's financials or future product releases. Therefore, the probabilities of the stock price rising or falling are relatively balanced, with a slight lean towards a positive outlook due to Cramer's comments."

(AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Apple's core business remains strong and unaffected.  The article highlights Apple's ability to adapt and find a new partner, minimizing the risk of significant long-term negative consequences.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  Considering Apple's history of successfully navigating challenges and the relatively small scale of the Apple Card compared to Apple's overall business, the probability of a significant stock price drop is low.  However, some short-term volatility and negative sentiment are possible during the transition period.  Therefore, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price rise, reflecting the overall strength of Apple's business and its capacity to manage this change effectively."

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors.

The overall sentiment from previous predictions is mixed, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. Considering the mixed signals and the potential for a smooth transition with a new partner, the probabilities seem balanced."

The financial losses and regulatory issues are primarily Goldman Sachs' problems.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty, but the overall trend leans slightly towards a rise, with most models predicting a probability of a rise above 0.4.  Considering Apple's resilience, the likely smooth transition to a new partner, and the relatively small scale of the Apple Card compared to Apple's overall business, the probability of a significant stock price drop is low.

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025. One of the ways we think investors can actually take advantage of that is being a little bit more dynamic in their portfolios.\u201d\n\nThree times each week, Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi fields insight-filled conversations and chats with the biggest names in business and markets on Opening Bid.

                                    "reasoning": "The news discusses Jim Cramer's comments on Apple Inc., particularly his defense against the perception of a lack of innovation since Steve Jobs. While Cramer finds this view inflammatory, he highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. The overall sentiment appears to be cautious, with mixed signals regarding Apple's performance in the current market, especially concerning AI and iPhone sales. Previous predictions show a balanced view with slight inclinations towards both a rise and a fall. Given Cramer's positive remarks and the overall strength of Apple's business, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline 'Why Apple Stock Could Get Hammered This Year' suggests a negative outlook for Apple's stock performance. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions regarding the potential impact of various factors on Apple's stock price. However, the overall trend seems to lean towards a cautious or negative outlook due to concerns about innovation, competition, and potential disruptions in partnerships. Given the negative tone of the headline and the mixed but leaning towards negative previous predictions, it is reasonable to infer that the news could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Nevertheless, Apple's strong track record of innovation, customer focus, and ability to adapt to challenges could mitigate some of the negative impacts. Therefore, while the probability of a stock price fall is considered higher, it is not significantly higher than the probability of a rise, reflecting the uncertainty and mixed signals in the analysis."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

While it introduces uncertainty and potential short-term disruption to Apple Card services, the impact is likely to be limited given Apple's overall financial strength and its ability to find a new partner.  Goldman Sachs' struggles are primarily their own issue. Apple's core business remains strong and largely unaffected. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty, but there's a slight trend towards a more neutral or slightly positive outlook in later rounds.  Considering Apple's history of successfully navigating challenges and the relatively small scale of the Apple Card compared to Apple's overall business, the probability of a significant stock price drop is low. However, some short-term volatility is possible during the transition period.  The overall strength of Apple's business and its capacity to manage this change effectively suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise, but the uncertainty warrants a probability less than 0.6."

It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good.

The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

While it introduces some short-term uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card services, Apple's immense financial strength and proven ability to adapt and find new partners mitigate the risk of significant negative impact.  Goldman Sachs' financial struggles with the Apple Card are primarily their problem. Apple's core business remains robust and largely unaffected.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty, but there's a slight trend towards a more neutral or slightly positive outlook in later rounds. Considering Apple's history of successfully navigating challenges and the relatively small scale of the Apple Card compared to Apple's overall business, the probability of a significant stock price drop is low. Some short-term volatility is possible during the transition period.  The overall strength of Apple's business and its capacity to manage this change effectively suggests a higher probability of a stock price rise, but the uncertainty warrants a probability less than 0.6.  The consistent slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise across multiple prediction rounds also supports this assessment."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Jim Cramer Discusses Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, And These 13 Stocks.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other stocks.\n\nIn one of his latest appearances on CNBC's Squawk on the Street, Jim Cramer started the morning by commenting on the latest Producer Price Index (PPI) release. The PPI, which tracks inflation upstream of the supply chain, rose by 0.2% in December and fell short of economist expectations of 0.3%. However, this didn't lead to any significant reaction in the bond market. According to Cramer, \"Carl these, the bonds just don't want to react to anything good. Of course, we can immediately say, it's because we're gonna get a tough CPI number tomorrow. The fact is, is these numbers are tame. People have to start recognizing that there are some good numbers coming.\"\n\nHe shared other factors that might be fueling the bond market's performance. \"House prices coming down, food coming down, but it doesn't seem to matter,\" Cramer remarked. He added \"What the bonds are reacting to I think is a new administration, uh, concern about what is going to be, uh, tariffs, even though it looks like they're going to be phased in. You know David, interest rates don't wanna come down here. And they don't wanna come down there's too much issuance, there's a belief that the next administration is much more inflationary. And David it doesn't seem to matter what is printed, the bonds don't want to go higher. Interest rate's not low enough.\"\n\nAnother news that has made a lot of headlines recently is TikTok's fate in the US. Cramer believes that rather than a complete bank, there could \"be a gradual diminution of the service. In other words, it's not going to be turned off. I think that this whole idea that the Chinese Communist Party is really just a gigantic private equity firm leaves me cold. I just don't think that they are in a situation to broker a deal.\"\n\nOne person that the CNBC TV show host believes isn't discussed enough is electric vehicle billionaire Elon Musk. \"I mean, Carl, it's so exciting to talk about Elon Musk. I mean we haven't talked about Elon, you know you have to wait maybe to nine o' four to talk about Elon Musk. I just say we do it at the very top,\" believes Cramer. He added \"We have Elon Musk being the most important, well, he's, he's co-president right now which I think is a little absurd.. . . this man has become, Carl, a nation-state within. He's a state within a state.\"\n\nStory Continues\n\nOn the topic of markets, Cramer was appreciative of the fact that the market and equal-weighted benchmark S&P indexes are up identically over the last six months \"Well look I, that's good news actually. We want to have broader leadership,\" he remarked. However, without Wall Street's favorite AI stock, Cramer believes \"you have a market that's kind of ruthless. . . David, you know that this market survives on NASDAQ fuel and not on Dow fuel. And yet people still insist on talking about the Dow.\"\n\nFinally, Cramer has also spent quite a bit of time discussing social media CEO Mark Zuckerberg's appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. This time around, he shared \"I'll go right to Joe Rogan. I'll be five hours in Joe Rogan. One of the most jarring things about the Joe Rogan interview was that he said he had to take a bathroom break. Well, there's professionalism personified.\" Cramer also commented on whether 38% is too much for an interviewer to speak. Taking a mixed view, he stated \"I think it is. I used to put a stopwatch to my show Kudlow & Cramer. I got to speak 38% of the time so you know what, maybe it's not so bad.\"\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that Jim Cramer talked about, we listed down all the stocks he mentioned during CNBC\u2019s Squawk on the Street aired yesterday.\n\nFor these stocks, we also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds invest in? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Safe Dividend Stock for 2025?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders In Q3 2024: 158\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the most valuable consumer technology company in the world. The stock's performance in today's AI era has been mixed. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares were laggards ahead of the WWDC conference last year, but since the event, they added 29.81% through the year. In 2025, the shares are down by 4.3% year-to-date as investors wonder whether Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) can push AI to consumers through its products and if the iPhone can sustain sales momentum. Cramer, for his part, shared his take on Mark Zuckerberg's comments that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s innovation has slowed:\n\n\"Well, I think when you say that there's been no innovation since Steve, Steve Jobs died, I don't know, I find that inflammatory. But you know what. . . .that was rough, I wanted to go to them and say could you please tell me, I wanted to call them on my Apple devices and use the 72 Apple devices I have [inaudible] and as well as the revenue stream, and talk about how we have now become integrated worldwide with Apple. But you know what let's just stick with Android.\"\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recently discussed. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 8 Best Wide Moat Stocks to Buy Now and 30 Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock.\n\nDisclosure: None.

While Cramer finds this view inflammatory, he highlights Apple's integration and revenue stream. The overall sentiment appears to be cautious, with mixed signals regarding Apple's performance in the current market, especially concerning AI and iPhone sales. Previous predictions show a balanced view with slight inclinations towards both a rise and a fall. Given Cramer's positive remarks and the overall strength of Apple's business, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the probabilities are relatively balanced due to the cautious tone and mixed performance of AAPL."

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

It highlights that while Apple carries a significant amount of debt, its net debt is manageable due to its large cash reserves. The article emphasizes Apple's low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and strong free cash flow generation, indicating a healthy financial position and ability to easily meet its debt obligations. The article also mentions a slight increase in EBIT, further easing debt repayment concerns. Overall, the article suggests that Apple's debt is not a significant risk and may even be used strategically to boost returns. This positive assessment of Apple's financial health is likely to be viewed favorably by investors, potentially leading to a slight increase in the stock price. However, the article also mentions two warning signs in their investment analysis, which could temper investor enthusiasm. Therefore, the probability of a rise is slightly higher than a fall, but not overwhelmingly so."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings.

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Key indicators like low net debt to EBITDA ratio, high interest coverage, and robust free cash flow generation suggest that Apple is well-positioned to manage its debt obligations. The article also notes a recent increase in EBIT, further supporting the company's ability to repay debt. While the article mentions two warning signs in their investment analysis, the overall tone is reassuring regarding Apple's financial stability. Considering the previous predictions, there's a mix of opinions, but the positive sentiment around Apple's debt management should outweigh the negative concerns. Therefore, I predict a higher probability of the stock price rising."

CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches.

The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support.

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from the Apple Card partnership presents a mixed picture for Apple's stock. While it introduces uncertainty and potential short-term disruption to Apple Card features, the impact on Apple's overall business is likely to be limited. Apple's core business remains strong, and its ability to find a new partner and maintain its ecosystem mitigates the risk of significant negative consequences.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price drop due to broader market trends or concerns about the 'Magnificent Seven', while others are more optimistic about Apple's resilience.  Considering the relatively minor nature of the news in the context of Apple's overall financial health and the potential for a smooth transition, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be small. The fact that Goldman Sachs' issues are primarily their own and not directly reflective of Apple's performance is a key factor in this assessment.  The previous predictions' varied reasoning and outcomes further support a neutral-to-slightly negative outlook, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the news."

However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

But with new narratives forming in the market \u2014 such as higher bond yields and inflated tech expectations \u2014 it may be time to sniff around the S&P's 493 other stocks.\n\nThose 493 stocks could post a very solid 11% earnings growth this year (faster than the 8% growth in 2024) and valuations may not yet reflect that, Gargi Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment strategist for the Americas, told Yahoo Finance Executive Editor Brian Sozzi on his Opening Bid podcast (video above; listen below).\n\nMag 7 names are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024 \u2014 a change many upbeat investors may not be anticipating.\n\nChaudhuri said there are good investing opportunities this year in financials.\n\n\"Broadly the theme that we're talking about in our year ahead outlook is one of quality. It is the intersection we call of quality and growth, with an eye on valuations because obviously valuations are very important to investors,\" Chaudhuri explained.\n\nChaudhuri may be ahead of the curve on her call as earnings season unfold.\n\nFactSet estimates that seven sectors from inside the S&P 500 should report fourth quarter earnings growth, and six should have growth in the double-digits. The financials sector is slated to chime in with the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%.\n\n\u201cIf you look at earnings growth expectations, not just for Q4, but in Q1 for financials is where we\u2019re expecting to see some of the strongest earnings growth come through after tech and comp services,\u201d notes Chaudhuri.\n\nFactSet says that double-digit profit growth should also hit information technology, consumer discretionary, healthcare, utilities, and communications services names.\n\nSee more from the Opening Bid podcast\n\nWhy you should buy the 493 other S&P 500 stocks \u2014 and not the Mag 7 Nvidia stock sell-off: Time to back up the truck?

Headlines abounded detailing how the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost nearly 700 points as wary investors react to potentially fewer Fed rate cuts.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, 10-year bond yields creeping toward 5% have rattled investors in the Mag 7 names \u2014a trade that usually works best when yields are below 4%.\n\nRead more: why the bull stampede in stocks may just be starting\n\nYear to date, Mag 7 name Nvidia (NVDA) is down 4%, Amazon (AMZN) is off by 2%, Apple (AAPL) is down 8%, Microsoft (MSFT) is down 2% and Alphabet (GOOGL) has dropped 1%. The lone outperformers are Meta (META) and Tesla (TSLA), likely on fresh efforts by CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk to curry favor with the incoming Trump administration.\n\n\u201cWe are beginning to see that there can be micro narratives that take hold of the market,\u201d said Chaudhuri. \u201cThey\u2019re going to be more prevalent in 2025.

The mention of higher bond yields and the potential for fewer Fed rate cuts creates a cautious sentiment around tech stocks, including Apple.

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return.

While there might be short-term disruption to Apple Card features and some uncertainty, Apple's strong ecosystem and history of successful transitions suggest a minimal long-term impact on its stock price.  Apple's core business remains robust and unaffected.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the news. However, the consensus leans slightly towards a price fall, primarily due to broader market concerns about the 'Magnificent Seven' and slowing earnings growth, rather than this specific news.  Considering Apple's resilience and the relatively minor nature of the Goldman Sachs issue in the context of Apple's overall financial health, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be small. The fact that Goldman Sachs' issues are primarily their own and not directly reflective of Apple's performance is a key factor in this assessment.  The previous predictions' varied reasoning and outcomes further support a neutral-to-slightly negative outlook, reflecting the uncertainty introduced by the news."

Additionally, Chaudhuri notes that the financials sector is expected to report the highest profit increase in the quarter at 39.5%. The article also mentions that the 'Magnificent Seven' names, including Apple, are expected to grow earnings by 18% in 2025, a slowdown from its 25% pace in 2024. This slowdown, combined with the potential for other sectors to outperform, may lead to a decrease in Apple's stock price. Furthermore, the article mentions that Apple's stock is already down 8% year-to-date, which could indicate a negative trend. Considering the previous predictions from other models, there is a general consensus that the probability of Apple's stock price rising is lower than the probability of it falling."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs' potential early exit from the Apple Card partnership is a relatively minor event in the context of Apple's overall business. While it introduces some short-term uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong ecosystem, history of successful transitions, and robust core business mitigate the risk of significant negative impact.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty. However, the consensus leans slightly towards a price fall, primarily due to broader market concerns about the 'Magnificent Seven' and slowing earnings growth, rather than this specific news.  Considering Apple's resilience and the relatively minor nature of the Goldman Sachs issue, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be small.  The fact that Goldman Sachs' issues are primarily their own and not directly reflective of Apple's performance is a key factor. The repeated emphasis on slowing growth for the 'Magnificent Seven' in previous predictions also weighs heavily on the overall assessment."

                                    "content": "Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) is eyeing an early exit from its Apple Card partnership, originally set to run through 2030, signaling a potential shake-up for both companies. CEO David Solomon dropped the news on a recent earnings call, pointing to mounting financial losses and regulatory headaches. Since its 2019 launch, the Apple Card has been a fan favorite for its seamless iOS integration, but it's been a financial drag for Goldman, hammering its Platform Solutions unit with an $859 million net loss in 2024. Toss in a $90 million fine from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau last year, and it's no wonder Goldman is rethinking its commitment.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with GS.\n\nDespite the Apple Card's struggles, Goldman's core businesses are thriving. The firm flexed its muscles in Global Banking & Markets, reporting a jaw-dropping 33% revenue surge in 2024, with strong gains in equity and debt underwriting. CEO David Solomon didn't hold back his optimism, forecasting better returns for Platform Solutions by 2025 or 2026 as the bank trims its focus and dials in on what it does best. Rumor has it that JPMorgan Chase is in the mix as a potential replacement for Apple's next card partner, though no deals are locked in yet.\n\nAs for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), this shake-up could rattle its Apple Card and Savings products, both of which lean heavily on Goldman for backend support. A partner swap might disrupt features like Daily Cash rewards or account management, and interest rate changes could leave users grumbling. But let's not count Apple outits knack for user-first innovation means they'll likely pull off a smooth pivot, keeping customers and their ecosystem intact. Investors should keep an eye on how this plays out, as it could reshape the financial trajectory for both giants.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news about Goldman Sachs potentially exiting its Apple Card partnership early introduces uncertainty but does not directly reflect on Apple's core business performance or financial health. While there might be short-term volatility due to this development, Apple's strong ecosystem, history of innovation, and customer retention capabilities suggest that the long-term impact on its stock price could be minimal. The partnership's termination is more of a reflection of Goldman Sachs' financial struggles and regulatory issues rather than a direct negative impact on Apple's core business, which remains strong and unaffected. However, considering the mixed signals and the potential for short-term disruption, there is a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

While there's short-term uncertainty and potential disruption to Apple Card features, Apple's strong ecosystem and history of successfully navigating such transitions suggest a smooth pivot.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the uncertainty.  However, the consistent theme across multiple models is the concern about slowing growth for the 'Magnificent Seven,' including Apple, and broader market trends.  These broader market factors seem to be weighing more heavily on the predictions than the specific Apple Card news.  While Apple's financial health and debt management are strong, the overall sentiment leans slightly towards a price fall due to the external factors.  The probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a rise, but the overall impact is likely to be relatively small."

                                    "headline": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Seems To Use Debt Rather Sparingly",
                                    "content": "David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. Importantly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple\n\nWhat Is Apple's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Apple had US$106.6b of debt in September 2024, down from US$111.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$65.2b, its net debt is less, at about US$41.5b.NasdaqGS:AAPL Debt to Equity History January 15th 2025\n\nA Look At Apple's Liabilities\n\nAccording to the last reported balance sheet, Apple had liabilities of US$176.4b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$131.6b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting this, it had US$65.2b in cash and US$66.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$176.6b.\n\nOf course, Apple has a titanic market capitalization of US$3.51t, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Carrying virtually no net debt, Apple has a very light debt load indeed.\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.\n\nStory Continues\n\nApple has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.31. And its EBIT covers its interest expense a whopping 673 times over. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. The good news is that Apple has increased its EBIT by 7.8% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Apple can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Apple generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 90% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nOur View\n\nApple's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. Zooming out, Apple seems to use debt quite reasonably; and that gets the nod from us. After all, sensible leverage can boost returns on equity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Be aware that  Apple is showing  2 warning signs in our investment analysis, you should know about...\n\nAt the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.
