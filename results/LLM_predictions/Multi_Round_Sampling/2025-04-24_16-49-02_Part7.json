Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While it acknowledges Apple's strong financial performance, market dominance, AI investments, and shareholder returns (dividends and buybacks), it also highlights concerns about its high valuation relative to historical averages and the lack of recent revolutionary product innovations. The article suggests that significant future gains like those seen in recent years may be harder to achieve due to Apple's already massive size. The author's personal investment strategy (holding some shares but diversifying) reflects this cautious outlook. The 'Double Down' advertisement is a general marketing tactic and doesn't specifically relate to the current analysis of Apple's stock. Considering the mixed signals, the probability of a significant rise is tempered by valuation concerns, while the probability of a fall is mitigated by Apple's fundamental strengths and potential for AI-driven growth. The article leans slightly towards caution, suggesting a higher probability of a slight fall or stagnation than a significant rise."

On the positive side, Apple is investing heavily in AI, has a strong financial position, pays a growing dividend, and has a history of repurchasing shares. However, the article also highlights concerns about Apple's valuation, noting that its price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, and price-to-cash flow ratios are higher than their five-year averages. Additionally, the company has not introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time, which could impact its growth potential. Given these mixed signals, the probability of the stock price rising is moderate, while the probability of it falling is significant due to the high valuation and potential for profit-taking."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

While it acknowledges Apple's strengths (market dominance, AI investments, dividends, buybacks), it emphasizes valuation concerns (high P/E, P/S ratios compared to historical averages) and the lack of recent revolutionary products. The author's personal investment strategy (reducing Apple holdings) reflects a cautious outlook. The 'Double Down' advertisement is a general marketing tactic. Considering the mixed signals and the previous rounds of predictions, I believe the probability of a fall is slightly higher than a rise. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall. The overall trend seems to be slightly bearish, considering the valuation concerns highlighted in the article."

While Apple's fundamental strength and potential for AI-driven growth mitigate the risk of a substantial fall, the overvaluation suggests a higher probability of a price correction or stagnation than a significant rise.  The author's own actions of diversifying their Apple holdings further support this cautious outlook.

Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally.

The author's personal decision to reduce their Apple holdings due to valuation and diversification reinforces the cautious outlook.  While Apple's fundamentals are strong, the high valuation suggests a higher probability of a price correction or stagnation than a significant rise.

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

Positive aspects include strong financials, AI investments, dividend payouts, and share buybacks. However, the high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, forward P/E, and price-to-cash flow ratios) compared to historical averages are a significant concern, suggesting overvaluation. The lack of a recent revolutionary product also raises concerns about future growth.  The author's personal decision to reduce their Apple holdings due to valuation and diversification reinforces the cautious outlook.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, but a slight bearish bias emerges in later rounds due to the valuation concerns.  Considering the overall context, including the cautionary tone of the headline and the article's emphasis on overvaluation, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in stock market predictions.  The potential for increased sales from storage upgrades is a positive factor, but it's not strong enough to outweigh the valuation concerns."

The headline itself warns investors to be wary. The trend in previous predictions shows a shift towards a higher probability of a fall, primarily due to these valuation concerns. While Apple's fundamentals are strong, the high valuation suggests a potential price correction. Considering the cautionary tone and the valuation concerns, I believe the probability of a fall is higher than a rise. The potential for increased sales from storage upgrades is a positive factor, but it's not strong enough to outweigh the valuation concerns."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The impact is likely to be neutral to slightly positive, as it reinforces the idea that consumers may need to upgrade to continue using Apple products effectively.

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

Positive factors include strong financials, AI investments, dividend payouts, and share buybacks.  However, the article emphasizes the high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E, forward P/E, and price-to-cash flow) compared to historical averages, suggesting the stock might be overvalued.  The lack of recent revolutionary products is also mentioned as a potential concern. While past performance is impressive, sustaining such high growth rates is unlikely given Apple's current size. The author's personal experience of reducing their Apple holdings due to valuation concerns and diversification further supports a cautious outlook.  The overall tone leans towards caution, suggesting a higher probability of a price correction than significant further gains in the short to medium term.  However, the long-term prospects remain positive due to Apple's strong brand and financial health."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a balanced perspective on Apple's stock, highlighting both its strengths (strong financials, AI investments, dividend payouts, share buybacks) and weaknesses (high valuation, lack of recent revolutionary products).  The high valuation metrics (P/S, P/E ratios significantly above their five-year averages) are a major concern, suggesting the stock may be overvalued and susceptible to a correction. While Apple's long-term prospects remain positive due to its brand strength and financial health, the immediate risk of a price decline due to overvaluation is significant. The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with a slight lean towards a price fall. Considering the article's focus on valuation concerns and the lack of a near-term catalyst for significant growth, a price correction seems more likely than a substantial rise in the short term.  However, the probability of a fall isn't overwhelmingly high, as Apple's fundamentals remain strong.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, but acknowledging the possibility of a rise."

This cautious tone implies potential concerns about future performance, which could lead investors to be cautious. The mention of being 'wary' typically indicates a negative sentiment, which may result in a higher probability of stock price decline. However, considering Apple's strong financials, brand loyalty, and historical performance, there is still a possibility for the stock price to rise, albeit with a lower probability.

It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The high valuation metrics are a significant concern, suggesting the stock might be overvalued and susceptible to a correction. While Apple's long-term prospects remain positive, the immediate risk of a price decline due to overvaluation is considerable.  The previous predictions show a consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall, reflecting the concerns about overvaluation.  The lack of a near-term catalyst for significant growth further supports this cautious outlook.  However, Apple's strong fundamentals and brand loyalty mitigate the risk of a drastic fall.  Considering all factors, a price correction seems more likely than a substantial rise in the short to medium term."

Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time.

The significant concern is the high valuation, with key metrics (P/S, P/E, etc.) substantially exceeding their five-year averages, suggesting overvaluation and potential for a price correction.  While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong due to its brand and financial health, the short-to-medium term outlook is clouded by this overvaluation.  The consistent trend in previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, reflecting this concern.  The lack of a near-term catalyst for significant growth further supports this cautious outlook.  However, a complete collapse is unlikely given Apple's strong fundamentals.  Therefore, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the possibility of a rise, but emphasizing the risk of a correction due to overvaluation."

The most significant concern is the high valuation, with key metrics (P/S, P/E, etc.) substantially exceeding their five-year averages. This suggests overvaluation and a potential for a price correction. While Apple's long-term prospects remain strong due to its brand and financial health, the short-to-medium term outlook is clouded by this overvaluation.  The consistent trend in previous predictions leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, reflecting this concern. The lack of a near-term catalyst for significant growth further supports this cautious outlook. However, a complete collapse is unlikely given Apple's strong fundamentals.  The previous predictions show a strong consensus towards a higher probability of a price fall, ranging from 0.65 to 0.75 in the later rounds.  Considering all factors, a price correction seems more likely than a substantial rise in the short to medium term. I'm therefore assigning a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the possibility of a rise, but emphasizing the risk of a correction due to overvaluation and the consensus of previous predictions."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time.

Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally.

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move.

It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it.

Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world.

Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation.

Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move.

It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation.

Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move.

Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock.

It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it.

This is a bearish sentiment piece, suggesting potential future risks rather than immediate positive news.  While being the largest company is generally positive, the article's focus on future wariness implies concerns about factors like slowing growth, increased competition, economic downturns, or potential regulatory challenges.  Without specifics on *why* investors should be wary, it's difficult to assign precise probabilities. However, the overall tone leans negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall than a rise in response to this news alone.  It's crucial to remember that this is just one news article and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.  Other factors, such as overall market conditions and Apple's financial performance, will significantly influence the stock price."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

It highlights both positive and negative factors for investing in Apple stock. On the positive side, Apple has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), has a growing dividend yield, and is financially healthy with a lucrative business. However, the article also cautions that Apple's valuation is high, with a recent price-to-sales ratio of 9.5, a price-to-earnings ratio of 39.8, and a forward-looking P/E ratio of 32.4. These metrics suggest that the stock might be overvalued, which could lead to a fall in stock price if the company's growth does not meet expectations. Additionally, the article mentions that Apple hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time, which could impact its future growth. Based on these factors, the estimated probability of the stock price rising is 0.55, reflecting the company's strong financials and potential for AI-driven growth. Conversely, the estimated probability of the stock price falling is 0.35, due to its high valuation and potential for a market correction."

However, it's not groundbreaking news and doesn't significantly alter the company's outlook.

The article highlights a user pain point that Apple already addresses with its product line, so it's unlikely to cause a major shift in investor sentiment.

While the article doesn't offer specific reasons for this wariness, the overall tone is bearish.  Previous predictions are mixed, with several models leaning towards a roughly equal probability of a rise or fall, while others show a slightly higher probability of a fall.  The lack of concrete negative news in the article itself suggests that the bearish sentiment is likely driven by broader market concerns or anxieties about Apple's future growth potential, rather than any immediate negative event. Considering the mixed predictions and the somewhat vague nature of the warning, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the cautious tone of the headline and the potential for market corrections given Apple's high valuation. However, the probability of a rise remains significant, given Apple's strong historical performance and ongoing investments in AI."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While the company is the largest in the world with strong revenue and profitability, concerns about its high valuation metrics and lack of recent revolutionary products may lead to cautious investor sentiment. The potential for a stock price rise is supported by ongoing investments in AI and a history of strong performance, but the overvaluation and market corrections could lead to a price decline. Given the mixed sentiments from previous predictions and the cautious tone of the article, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but still acknowledge the significant risk of a fall."

The previous predictions are mixed, with a slight tendency towards a higher probability of a fall, especially in the later rounds.

Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time.

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The probabilities of a stock price rise and fall are estimated based on the overall sentiment of the news article and the trend of previous predictions, taking into account the company's strong financials, high valuation, and potential for market corrections."

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Additionally, the lack of a revolutionary new product introduction in a long time is cited as a reason for caution. Considering these factors, the probability of the stock price rising is estimated to be lower than the probability of it falling, as the overvaluation and lack of innovation might lead to a correction in the stock price."

I'll adjust the probabilities slightly upwards for a rise, acknowledging the potential for increased sales, but not significantly, as the article primarily addresses a user problem rather than a major company announcement.

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The headline itself is not directly negative, but the underlying issue of storage limitations and the cost of upgrades could be seen as a minor negative by some investors. Considering the subtle positive impact on sales and the existing concerns, I'll slightly increase the probability of a rise compared to the average of previous predictions, but still acknowledge the significant risk of a fall. The consistent bearish trend in previous rounds from some models due to the 'caution for 2025' headline is also considered, but the current article is more directly related to potential revenue."

Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation.

Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time.

Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time.

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock performance in 2025. On one hand, Apple's position as the largest company in the world, its solid financial performance, investments in artificial intelligence, dividend payments, and share repurchases are all positive factors. On the other hand, the company's high valuation, lack of revolutionary new products in recent years, and potential risks associated with being the largest company could lead to a correction or selling pressure. Considering the cautious tone of the article and the high valuation metrics, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. However, given Apple's strong financials and market position, the difference in probabilities is not extreme."

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock performance in 2025, highlighting both positive factors such as the company's solid financial performance, investments in artificial intelligence, dividend payments, and share repurchases, as well as negative factors like high valuation, lack of revolutionary new products, and potential risks associated with being the largest company. Considering the cautious tone of the article, the high valuation metrics, and the mixed sentiments from previous predictions, I estimate that the probability of the stock price falling is slightly higher than the probability of it rising. However, given Apple's strong financials and market position, the difference in probabilities is not extreme."

Previous rounds show a trend towards a more negative outlook, with probabilities of a price fall consistently higher than those of a price rise.  While some models point to potential positive impacts from iPhone upgrades, these are considered minor compared to the overall bearish sentiment. The lack of concrete positive news reinforces the negative outlook.  The consistent bearish sentiment from multiple models, even after considering potential positive factors like iPhone upgrades, outweighs any potential positive impact from the news.

The repeated emphasis on wariness across multiple models and rounds suggests a significant negative market sentiment.  The lack of specific reasons for the caution in the news article itself contributes to the uncertainty, but the consistent negative trend in predictions across different models strengthens the bearish outlook.

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly?

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

The mixed signals from the news and the historical performance volatility of Apple's stock suggest a cautious approach. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall due to valuation concerns."

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The potential for a stock price rise is supported by ongoing investments in AI and a history of strong performance, but the overvaluation and market corrections could lead to a price decline. Given the mixed signals from previous predictions and the cautious tone of the news, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a price fall due to valuation concerns, but still recognize the potential for growth based on Apple's strong fundamentals."

While Apple's fundamentals remain strong, the market's perception of overvaluation and the absence of groundbreaking new products are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock price.

While the company's fundamentals are solid, the current valuation metrics suggest potential overvaluation, which could lead to a price correction. The mixed signals from the news and the historical performance volatility of Apple's stock suggest a cautious approach. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a fall due to valuation concerns."

This cautious tone implies potential concerns about the stock's growth prospects or market position. The previous predictions from various models indicate a mixed outlook, with some models predicting a higher probability of the stock price rising (up to 0.55) and others predicting a higher probability of the stock price falling (up to 0.7). The concerns mentioned include high valuation metrics, lack of recent revolutionary products, and potential market corrections. However, Apple's strong financial health, investments in AI, and history of performance are noted as positive factors. Considering these mixed signals, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling due to cautionary sentiments and valuation concerns."

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The previous rounds of predictions show a consistent trend towards a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to valuation concerns. While Apple's fundamentals remain strong, the market's perception of overvaluation and the absence of groundbreaking new products are likely to exert downward pressure on the stock price. The author's personal investment and partial shedding of shares also suggest a cautious outlook. Considering these factors and the trend in previous predictions, I believe the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise, but the AI investment could be a game changer."

It focuses on a minor user-level issue (iPhone storage limitations) that is unlikely to significantly impact investor sentiment or Apple's financial performance.  The overwhelming consensus from the previous prediction rounds points towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, primarily due to concerns about Apple's high valuation relative to its historical averages and the lack of recent revolutionary product innovations.  While Apple's strong fundamentals (financial health, AI investments, shareholder returns) provide some support for a price rise, the valuation concerns seem to be the dominant factor influencing the predictions. My prediction incorporates this prevailing sentiment, acknowledging the minimal impact of the news article itself and emphasizing the pre-existing market concerns about valuation.  The consistent trend towards a higher probability of a price fall across multiple models and rounds strengthens this conclusion."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time.

While it might be seen as a non-material issue for investors, it can also be interpreted as a minor inconvenience that does not directly impact the financial health, growth prospects, or competitive position of Apple. The content suggests ways to reclaim space, which might even lead to increased usage of iCloud services, potentially boosting revenue. Thus, the direct impact on stock price movement due to this news seems limited."

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

While Apple's strong fundamentals and investments in AI offer potential for growth, the inherent risk associated with its current valuation and the uncertainty surrounding future innovation outweigh the positive factors in the context of this news alone.

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally.

However, given Apple's historical resilience and innovation capabilities, the probability of a price fall is not overwhelming."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The time horizon of 2025 allows for market adjustments and reactions to any underlying issues. Given the trend of increasing probability of price fall in the previous rounds, I will further increase the probability of price fall, but not overwhelmingly so, as Apple has demonstrated resilience. The lack of specific details in the news content makes a precise probability estimation difficult, but the cautionary tone leans towards a higher probability of a price fall. The time horizon is also important, as the impact is predicted for 2025, allowing time for the market to digest and react to the underlying concerns, whatever they may be.

Considering the mixed signals, the long time horizon (2025), and the trend in previous predictions, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, reflecting the cautious sentiment but acknowledging Apple's resilience and potential for future growth. The lack of concrete details in the news itself contributes to the uncertainty, making a strong prediction difficult. The consistent downward trend in the probability of a price rise across rounds further reinforces this prediction.  My prediction incorporates the overall bearish sentiment from the news and the converging opinions of the previous models, while still acknowledging Apple's inherent strength and potential."

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This cautious tone implies potential uncertainty or negative outlooks for the company's future stock price movement. Given that the article likely discusses various challenges, market saturation, competition, or overvaluation concerns, investors might be cautious about the stock's prospects. However, without specific details on why investors should be wary, we must consider general market trends and the nature of Apple's business. Historically, Apple has shown resilience and innovation, but any warnings about its stock performance could be based on factors like market saturation, competition, or economic conditions. Therefore, while there's a reason to be cautious (probability of stock price fall), there's also a strong case for Apple's continued dominance and growth (probability of stock price rise). Considering the general tone of caution and assuming no major positive surprises or setbacks are announced, a balanced approach would suggest a slightly higher chance of stock price movement downwards due to potential overvaluation or market saturation concerns."

                                    "content": "Almost everyone knows Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you\u2019ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a \u201cDouble Down\u201d stock recommendation\u00a0for companies that they think are about to pop.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook for Apple's stock. While it acknowledges Apple's strong financial performance, investments in AI, and shareholder returns (dividends and buybacks), it also highlights concerns about the company's high valuation relative to its historical averages. The article also points out the lack of recent revolutionary product innovations. The author's personal investment strategy of reducing their Apple holdings suggests a cautious sentiment. The 'Double Down' advertisement within the article is a marketing tactic and should not be considered as part of the fundamental analysis. Considering these factors, the high valuation and lack of recent groundbreaking products are likely to exert downward pressure, while the AI investments and shareholder returns provide some support. Therefore, the probability of a price fall is slightly higher than a price rise."

This is a bearish sentiment piece, suggesting potential future risks rather than immediate positive news.  While being the largest company is generally positive, the article's focus on future wariness implies concerns about factors like slowing growth, increased competition, economic downturns, or potential regulatory challenges.  Without specifics on *why* investors should be wary, it's difficult to assign precise probabilities. However, the overall tone leans negative, suggesting a higher probability of a price fall than a rise in response to this news alone.  It's crucial to remember that this is just one news article and should not be the sole basis for investment decisions.

It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time.

On the positive side, Apple has a strong financial position, is investing heavily in AI, pays a growing dividend, and has a history of share repurchases.

Additionally, the article mentions that Apple hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time, which could impact its growth potential. Given these mixed signals, the cautious tone in the headline, and the high valuation, there seems to be a slightly higher probability of the stock price falling than rising.

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen.

Many millions of us have the company's devices in our pockets, handbags, or desktops, and many millions send Apple lots of money every year. Indeed, in Apple's last fiscal year, it raked in $391 billion in revenue. Better still, it kept fully 24% of that, more than $90 billion, as net income.Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSo it won't surprise you that Apple is among the largest companies in the world. It's actually the biggest company in the world, with a recent market value of $3.68 trillion, ahead of Nvidia ($3.54 trillion), Microsoft ($3.15 trillion), Alphabet ($2.36 trillion), and Amazon ($2.36 trillion).\n\nDespite all that, investing in Apple is not a no-brainer move. It does require a little brain work, because there are both reasons to invest in it and reasons you might not want to.\n\nWhy you might invest in Apple\n\nHere are some solid reasons to consider investing in Apple stock:\n\nIt has been investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which may pay off handsomely. Some expect that \"Apple Intelligence,\" which is already incorporated in many products, may drive a lot of upgrades. Some expect that, with more than 2 billion Apple devices in existence, Apple may become the biggest provider of AI to consumers. Apple is a dividend-paying stock. Its dividend yield was recently only 0.41%, but that payout has been growing -- by an average annual rate of about 6%. It's currently paying about $0.99 per share per year, up from $0.76 in 2019 and $0.51 in 2015. Apple has done a lot of repurchasing of its own shares, so that its total yield to shareholders, including both dividends and buybacks, per Morningstar, was recently 3%. Apple is financially healthy, and its lucrative business results in its having the means to invest heavily in its future growth, whether via research and development or acquisitions.\n\nWhy you might not want to invest in Apple\n\nDespite all that, there's a good reason to think twice before investing in Apple: its valuation. Consider these recent metrics:\n\nMetric Recent Five-Year Average Price-to-sales ratio (PSR) 9.5 6.9 Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio 39.8 28.4 Forward-looking P/E ratio 32.4 26.8 Price-to-cash flow ratio 32.6 23.3\n\nData source: Morningstar as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nIf you buy into Apple now and hold for many years or decades, you'll likely make money -- and potentially a lot of it. Nevertheless, it is not unlikely for an overvalued stock to fall back to a more reasonable level. And if you were to buy at a lower level, all your gains would be greater. Much depends on your risk tolerance.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeanwhile, those rich valuation numbers are a result of some terrific performances in recent years:\n\nYear Apple Gain (or Loss) 2024 30.1% 2023 48.2% 2022 (26.8%) 2021 33.8% 2020 80.8% 2019 86.2% 2018 (6.8%) 2017 46.1% 2016 10.0%\n\nData source: 1stock1.com as of Jan. 8, 2025.\n\nAnother reason to think twice about investing in Apple is that it hasn't introduced a revolutionary new product in a long time. Granted, few companies ever do, but Apple has done so multiple times, with offerings such as the iPod, iPad, iPhone, Apple Watch, and more.\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nWhether you should buy, sell, or hold Apple depends a lot on you. Do you see the company continuing to introduce great new products in the years to come and having its value grow accordingly? Do you think its current price is reasonable, a bargain, or very overvalued?\n\nI think it's reasonable to expect Apple to not deliver 80% gains in any future years, though it could, of course, happen. Once a company is worth several trillion dollars, it can be harder to grow quickly, though it's still possible.\n\nIf you're tempted but unsure, you might buy a small position in Apple, or establish a bigger position over time, buying shares incrementally. Or just add the stock to your watch list and wait and hope for a more attractive entry point.\n\nI am an Apple shareholder personally, and I'm planning to remain one for a long time. I have, however, shed some shares over the past year or two -- in part so that I don't have too many eggs in that one Apple basket, and in part because I see various other stocks as also promising and more undervalued.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This negative sentiment is consistently echoed across multiple previous predictions from various large language models. While Apple possesses strengths such as AI investments and strong financials, concerns about high valuation relative to historical averages and a lack of recent revolutionary product innovations are significant. The consensus among previous predictions leans heavily towards a higher probability of a price fall (around 0.6 to 0.7).  Considering the persistent bearish sentiment and the lack of specific positive news in the headline, I'm assigning a higher probability to a price fall, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty in predicting stock movements based solely on a headline. The consistent downward trend in predictions across rounds further reinforces this bearish outlook.  One model consistently predicts a higher probability of a rise based on a perceived positive impact from increased sales of higher-storage iPhones, but this seems to be a misinterpretation or overemphasis of a minor detail in the context of the overall negative sentiment expressed in the headline and the majority of other predictions."

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline and content express a cautious sentiment towards Apple's stock in 2025, despite its status as the world's largest company. The article highlights both positive factors, such as investments in AI, strong financial health, and shareholder returns, and negative factors, including high valuation relative to historical averages and the lack of recent revolutionary product innovations. The majority of previous predictions from various models lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, primarily due to concerns about valuation and the cautious tone of the headline. Considering these mixed signals and the overall negative sentiment, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling than rising."

                                    "reasoning": "The news headline suggests caution regarding Apple's stock in 2025, despite its status as the world's largest company. This cautious tone, combined with concerns about high valuation, lack of recent innovative products, and potential market challenges, contributes to a negative sentiment. The majority of previous predictions from various models lean towards a higher probability of the stock price falling, with many indicating probabilities of a price fall around 0.6 to 0.7. Considering the overall negative sentiment, the emphasis on caution, and the mixed but predominantly bearish predictions from other models, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising."

The phrase 'Here's Why Investors Should Be Wary' indicates negative sentiment which could affect investor confidence negatively.

It implies that the investment could potentially yield significant returns, making investors hopeful about the stock's future.

Given Apple's historical performance and its status as a large-cap tech stock, the article likely appeals to investors' emotions rather than presenting a factual analysis that could drastically change stock price predictions. Therefore, while the headline may attract attention and potentially boost the stock price in the short term due to increased interest, the actual probability of a significant rise or fall should be considered in the context of Apple's current financial health, market trends, and competitive landscape."

The headline's optimistic tone might slightly increase investor interest, but this effect is likely minimal and temporary.  The analysis of previous predictions shows a strong consensus that this headline is unlikely to cause significant price movement. Most models consistently assign near-neutral probabilities (around 0.5) or very low probabilities (around 0.05) to both a price rise and fall. This indicates that the headline's impact on Apple's stock price is negligible compared to other factors like earnings reports, product announcements, and overall market sentiment.

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a Wall Street analyst's opinion on top tech stocks for 2025. While Apple is included in the list, the analyst expresses hesitation regarding Apple's prospects, citing concerns about the market impact of its new AI features, 'Apple Intelligence', and suggesting that the value proposition for consumers to upgrade might be insufficient.  The analyst notes that Apple was late to the AI game and that existing iPhone users might not find the new features compelling enough to justify a costly upgrade. This cautious outlook contrasts with the generally bullish sentiment towards other companies mentioned. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is considered lower than for other companies in the article, while the probability of a price fall or stagnation is higher."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves.

The overall sentiment of the news is negative towards AI stocks, but without direct mention, the effect on AAPL might be less severe.

However, Apple's strong market position and diversified product line may mitigate any adverse effects.

A smooth and well-received succession plan is generally viewed positively, suggesting stability and continuity. However, the market's reaction to Howie Buffett's appointment is uncertain. Some investors might see it as a positive sign of maintaining Berkshire's culture, while others might question his qualifications or the overall direction of the company under new leadership. Given the indirect impact on Apple and the potential for mixed reactions to the news, I'm assigning slightly higher probability to a rise, assuming a generally positive market sentiment towards Berkshire's stability. The previous rounds show a wide range of predictions, with some models assigning very low probabilities due to the indirect nature of the news, while others are more neutral. Considering this, I will adjust my prediction to be slightly more positive than neutral, but not overly optimistic."

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple. While included in a list of top picks for 2025, the analyst expresses reservations about the impact of its new AI features, 'Apple Intelligence', on driving significant iPhone upgrades.  The analyst's concern stems from Apple's late entry into the AI market and the possibility that existing users might not find the new features compelling enough to justify an upgrade. This cautious assessment contrasts with the more bullish sentiment towards other companies mentioned.  Considering the previous predictions, which range from a 0.05 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, and the analyst's mixed sentiment, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, acknowledging the potential for the new iPhone to stimulate sales but also the uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of its AI features. The probability of a price fall is also considered, reflecting the analyst's hesitation and the possibility that the market may react negatively to the perceived lack of a strong AI value proposition."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While included in a list of top picks for 2025 by a Wall Street analyst, the analyst expresses reservations about the impact of its new AI features, 'Apple Intelligence', on driving significant iPhone upgrades. The analyst's concern stems from Apple's late entry into the AI market and the possibility that existing users might not find the new features compelling enough to justify an upgrade. This cautious assessment contrasts with the more bullish sentiment towards other companies mentioned.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news on Apple's stock price.  Considering the analyst's mixed sentiment, Apple's strong brand and market position, and the potential for the new iPhone to stimulate sales, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, but the possibility of a price fall or stagnation is also acknowledged. The overall uncertainty and mixed signals lead to probabilities closer to even."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The mixed predictions from various analysts and models suggest a cautious outlook, with some models indicating a slight inclination towards a negative impact due to the general sentiment towards AI stocks, while others see minimal direct impact.

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple. While included in a list of top picks for 2025 by a Wall Street analyst, the analyst expresses reservations about the impact of its new AI features, 'Apple Intelligence', on driving significant iPhone upgrades. This is due to Apple's late entry into the AI market and the possibility that existing users might not find the new features compelling enough to justify an upgrade.  This cautious assessment contrasts with the more bullish sentiment towards other companies mentioned. The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news on Apple's stock price. Considering the analyst's mixed sentiment, Apple's strong brand and market position, and the potential for the new iPhone to stimulate sales, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, but the possibility of a price fall or stagnation is also acknowledged.  The overall uncertainty and mixed signals, combined with the lack of any overwhelmingly positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, lead to probabilities closer to even.  The previous predictions show a trend towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise, but the uncertainty remains significant."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(AAPL). However, given that Apple is a major player in AI through its products and services like Siri and Core ML, any negative sentiment towards AI stocks could indirectly affect Apple's stock price. The mixed predictions from various analysts and models suggest a cautious outlook, with some models indicating a slight inclination towards a negative impact due to the general sentiment towards AI stocks, while others see minimal direct impact. Considering Apple's diversified product line and strong market position, the direct impact of this news on its stock price might be limited. However, the overall negative sentiment towards AI-related stocks could potentially lead to a cautious or slightly negative outlook for AAPL. Based on the analysis of previous predictions and the indirect nature of the impact, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall due to negative sentiment in the sector, but also acknowledge the potential for a rise due to Apple's resilience."

                                    "reasoning": "The news article presents a mixed outlook on Apple. While included in a list of top picks for 2025, the analyst expresses reservations about the impact of its new AI features, 'Apple Intelligence', on driving significant iPhone upgrades. This is due to Apple's late entry into the AI market and the possibility that existing users might not find the new features compelling enough to justify an upgrade.  This contrasts with the more bullish sentiment towards other companies mentioned.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the impact of this news on Apple's stock price.  Considering the analyst's mixed sentiment, Apple's strong brand and market position, and the potential for the new iPhone to stimulate sales, a moderate probability of a price rise is assigned, but the possibility of a price fall or stagnation is also acknowledged. The overall uncertainty and mixed signals, combined with the lack of any overwhelmingly positive or negative news directly impacting Apple, lead to probabilities closer to even.  The trend in previous predictions shows some fluctuation, but generally remains around 0.5 for both rise and fall.  Therefore, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect this overall uncertainty and the mixed signals from the news and previous predictions."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves.

Given Apple's strong market position and the positive sentiment conveyed by the analyst, the stock price is more likely to rise than fall in response to this news. However, the prediction is for 2025, which introduces some uncertainty regarding immediate stock price movements. Previous predictions from various models indicate a general consensus leaning towards a price rise, with probabilities ranging from 0.5 to 0.75 for a rise.

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, there are concerns about whether these features will be compelling enough for consumers to upgrade, given that Apple's products are often seen as luxury items. This uncertainty leads to a mixed sentiment around Apple's stock. While there is potential for price appreciation if the iPhone 16 is well-received, the skepticism about the AI features dampens the overall bullish sentiment. Therefore, I estimate a moderate probability of price rise and a slightly lower probability of price fall."

Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While Apple is included in the list, the analyst expresses hesitation regarding Apple's new AI features, suggesting they may not be enough to drive significant upgrades and a resulting 'supercycle'.  The analyst questions whether the added value of Apple Intelligence justifies the cost of a new iPhone for existing users, implying a potential lack of strong demand. This cautious outlook contrasts with the more bullish predictions for other companies in the list. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is considered lower than for companies with more positive assessments. The probability of a fall is also not high, as the analyst doesn't predict a significant downturn, but rather a lack of substantial upward momentum due to the perceived limitations of Apple Intelligence."

He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell.

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, given that Ives is a reputable analyst and his endorsement can boost investor confidence, the probability of a stock price rise is moderate to high. The skepticism about the AI features prevents a very high rise probability, and the luxury nature of Apple's products suggests that a significant price fall is less likely."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Considering the endorsement by a reputable analyst and the strong fundamentals of Apple, but also taking into account the concerns about the AI features, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising and a lower probability of the stock price falling."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This uncertainty leads to a balanced view with moderate bullishness. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, but they generally lean towards a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a moderate probability of a stock price fall. Considering the mixed sentiment and the endorsement by a reputable analyst, the overall probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher, but not overwhelmingly so."

He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

A prominent analyst, Dan Ives, is bullish due to the potential iPhone 16 supercycle driven by 'Apple Intelligence'. However, the article expresses significant skepticism, questioning whether the new AI features will be compelling enough to drive upgrades, especially given the luxury nature of Apple products.  The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, reflecting this uncertainty.  While Ives' bullishness provides some upward pressure, the skepticism regarding the AI features and the potential for underwhelming sales of the iPhone 16 counterbalance this.  Considering the overall mixed sentiment and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative catalysts, a moderate probability of both price rise and fall is assigned, with a slight lean towards a rise given Ives' reputation and Apple's generally strong market position. The iterative predictions show a slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise, suggesting a gradual increase in confidence in the positive outlook, but the uncertainty remains significant."

Dan Ives, a respected Wall Street analyst, remains bullish on Apple due to the expected iPhone 16 and its AI features, which could drive upgrades. However, there is considerable skepticism expressed in the article about whether these features will be compelling enough to justify upgrades, particularly given the luxury nature of Apple's products. This uncertainty leads to a balanced view with moderate bullishness. The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, but they generally lean towards a moderate probability of a stock price rise and a moderate probability of a stock price fall. Considering the mixed sentiment and the endorsement by a reputable analyst, the overall probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher, but not overwhelmingly so."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The previous predictions from various models show a range of probabilities, reflecting this uncertainty. While Ives' bullishness provides some upward pressure, the skepticism regarding the AI features and the potential for underwhelming sales of the iPhone 16 counterbalance this. Considering the overall mixed sentiment and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative catalysts, a moderate probability of both price rise and fall is assigned, with a slight lean towards a rise given Ives' reputation and Apple's generally strong market position. The iterative predictions show a slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise, suggesting a gradual increase in confidence in the positive outlook, but the uncertainty remains significant.

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While a well-respected analyst, Dan Ives, is bullish due to the potential for an iPhone 16 supercycle driven by 'Apple Intelligence', the article itself expresses significant skepticism. This skepticism centers on whether the new AI features will be compelling enough to drive significant upgrades, especially given the luxury nature of Apple products and the potential for existing users to find the upgrade not worthwhile.  The previous predictions from various models show a consistent range of probabilities, reflecting this inherent uncertainty.  While Ives' bullishness provides some upward pressure, the skepticism regarding the AI features and the potential for underwhelming sales of the iPhone 16 counterbalance this. Considering the overall mixed sentiment and the lack of overwhelmingly positive or negative catalysts, a moderate probability of both price rise and fall is assigned. The iterative predictions show a slight upward trend in the probability of a price rise, suggesting a gradual increase in confidence in the positive outlook, but the uncertainty remains significant.  I'm leaning slightly towards a higher probability of a price rise due to Ives' reputation and Apple's generally strong market position, but the uncertainty remains substantial."

He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While a prominent analyst, Dan Ives, remains bullish due to the potential for an iPhone 16 supercycle driven by 'Apple Intelligence,' the author expresses skepticism. The author questions whether the AI features will be compelling enough to drive upgrades, especially given the luxury nature of Apple's products. This conflicting viewpoint creates uncertainty. The 'Double Down' advertisement at the end of the article is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact. Overall, the article presents a slightly negative sentiment towards Apple compared to other 'Magnificent Seven' stocks. Therefore, the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than a price fall."

The analyst notes that Apple was late to the AI game and that existing iPhone users might not find the new features compelling enough to justify a costly upgrade. This cautious outlook contrasts with the more bullish assessments of other companies in the list. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price fall or stagnation, although the overall impact is likely to be relatively small given the limited nature of the news and the already high valuation of Apple."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While a prominent analyst, Dan Ives, includes Apple in his top picks for 2025, the author expresses skepticism about the iPhone 16 supercycle driven by 'Apple Intelligence.' The author questions whether the AI features will be compelling enough to drive upgrades, especially given the luxury nature of Apple's products. This conflicting viewpoint creates uncertainty. Considering the previous rounds of predictions, there's a wide range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to analyst endorsement and others towards a price fall due to skepticism about Apple's AI strategy. Given the mixed signals and the existing high valuation of Apple, I believe the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than a price fall. However, the overall impact is likely to be moderate given the limited nature of the news."

Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

This negative prediction from analysts could lead to a decrease in investor confidence, potentially causing the stock price to fall. Considering the previous predictions, there is a mix of opinions, but the overall trend seems to be slightly bearish. Models with higher predictions of a price rise seem to be based on older news or different analyst endorsements, which may not be directly relevant to the current news.

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves.

The probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, but both probabilities remain relatively low, reflecting the limited impact of this single news item on Apple's overall stock performance.  The overall sentiment leans slightly towards a price fall due to the author's skepticism outweighing the positive analyst recommendation, but the difference is not significant."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "reasoning": "The news presents a mixed outlook for Apple.  While a prominent analyst, Dan Ives, includes Apple in his top picks for 2025, the article itself expresses skepticism about the impact of Apple's new AI features on driving iPhone upgrades. The author questions whether the AI improvements will be sufficient to convince consumers to upgrade, especially considering the premium price point. This conflicting viewpoint creates uncertainty.  The previous predictions show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting this uncertainty. Some models emphasize the positive analyst recommendation, while others highlight the skepticism regarding Apple's AI strategy. Considering the mixed signals, the long-term prediction (2025), and Apple's already high valuation, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted. The overall trend in previous predictions leans slightly towards a price fall, primarily due to the author's skepticism outweighing the positive analyst recommendation. However, the difference is not significant.  The probability of a price rise is slightly lower than the probability of a price fall, but both probabilities remain relatively low, reflecting the limited impact of this single news item on Apple's overall stock performance."

Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves.

The previous rounds of predictions show a range of opinions, with some models leaning towards a price rise due to analyst endorsement and others towards a price fall due to skepticism about Apple's AI strategy. The overall trend in previous predictions seems to be shifting towards a more neutral to slightly negative outlook. Given the mixed signals, the existing high valuation of Apple, and the long-term nature of the prediction (2025), I believe the probability of a price rise is slightly lower than a price fall. The skepticism about Apple's AI strategy seems to be gaining more weight in the analysis. Also, the fact that the news is about 2025 makes it less impactful in the short term."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI.

While a prominent analyst, Dan Ives, includes Apple in his top picks for 2025, the article itself expresses skepticism about the impact of Apple's new AI features ('Apple Intelligence') on driving iPhone upgrades. The author questions whether the AI improvements will be sufficient to convince consumers to upgrade, especially considering the premium price point of Apple products. This creates significant uncertainty.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting this uncertainty. Some models emphasize the positive analyst recommendation, while others highlight the skepticism regarding Apple's AI strategy and the long-term nature of the prediction (2025).  Considering the mixed signals, Apple's already high valuation, and the long timeframe, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted. The overall trend in previous predictions leans slightly towards a price fall, primarily due to the author's skepticism outweighing the positive analyst recommendation, but the difference is not significant.

Considering the mixed sentiments from various predictions, the probability of a stock price rise is moderately higher, but the cautious sentiments about Apple's AI features and the long-term nature of the recommendation temper this optimism."

Therefore, there is a moderate probability that Apple's stock price could fall due to this broader negative sentiment, but it is also possible that investors may view Apple as a strong company and not react as negatively.

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The 'Double Down' advertisement within the article is generic and doesn't specifically endorse Apple, so it has minimal impact. Given the analyst's positive view is tempered by the author's concerns, the probability of a significant price rise is moderate, and the probability of a price fall is also notable."

Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Apple is one of the stocks mentioned, with Ives remaining bullish on the company due to its new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence. However, the article also expresses concerns about Apple's late entry into the AI game and whether Apple Intelligence provides enough value to inspire customers to upgrade their devices. Given this mixed sentiment, I estimate that the probability of the stock price rising is lower than the probability of the stock price falling."

This type of headline often triggers both positive and negative reactions among investors due to its speculative nature.

However, it could also be dismissed by more seasoned investors, leading to no significant change or even a slight decline if the market reacts negatively to the sensationalism. Overall, the impact is likely to be minimal and short-lived."

He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech.

Considering the mixed sentiment and the previous predictions from various models, the probabilities are estimated with a slight tilt towards a potential rise in stock price, as the analyst's positive view seems to outweigh the concerns."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Therefore, the probabilities are estimated to be neutral."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While Ives is bullish on Apple due to the potential iPhone 16 supercycle driven by 'Apple Intelligence,' there are also concerns about whether these features will be compelling enough to drive upgrades.

Dan Ives is bullish due to the potential iPhone 16 supercycle driven by 'Apple Intelligence,' but the author expresses skepticism about whether the AI features will be compelling enough to drive upgrades. This creates uncertainty. Previous rounds show a fluctuating sentiment, with initial concerns about negative AI sector sentiment shifting towards a more balanced view. The analyst's positive view is tempered by the author's concerns. Considering the mixed signals and the trend towards a neutral stance in previous predictions, I'll assign probabilities that reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the analyst's influence and the potential for a positive market reaction to the 'Magnificent Seven' endorsement."

This indirectly introduces some negative sentiment towards the AI sector, which could impact Apple given its involvement in AI. However, the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the mixed predictions in previous rounds suggest a limited impact.  The previous rounds show a trend towards a more neutral stance, with probabilities for rise and fall converging around 0.5.  While some models lean towards a price fall due to potential spillover effects from negative AI stock news, others maintain a neutral stance.  Considering the indirect nature of the news and the conflicting opinions, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral stance due to Apple's strong brand and generally positive analyst sentiment (as evidenced by Dan Ives' bullish outlook on Apple despite concerns about the iPhone 16's AI features). The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with the potential for a positive market reaction outweighing the negative sentiment from the unrelated AI stock news."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Some analysts remain bullish on Apple due to potential growth from the iPhone 16 and its AI features, creating a mixed outlook. Given the uncertainty and the potential for negative sentiment, I estimate a slightly higher probability of a stock price fall compared to a rise."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The analyst's positive view is tempered by the author's concerns. Considering the mixed signals and the trend towards a neutral stance in previous predictions, I'll assign probabilities that reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a price rise due to the analyst's influence and the potential for a positive market reaction to the 'Magnificent Seven' endorsement.

However, the lack of direct relevance to Apple and the mixed predictions in previous rounds suggest a limited impact.  The previous rounds show a trend towards a more neutral stance, with probabilities for rise and fall converging around 0.5. While some models lean towards a price fall due to potential spillover effects from negative AI stock news, others maintain a neutral stance or even lean slightly towards a rise due to positive analyst sentiment regarding Apple's potential iPhone 16 supercycle and the 'Magnificent Seven' endorsement.  Considering the indirect nature of the news and the conflicting opinions, I'm assigning probabilities that reflect this uncertainty, leaning slightly towards a neutral stance due to Apple's strong brand and generally positive analyst sentiment. The overall sentiment is cautiously optimistic, with the potential for a positive market reaction outweighing the negative sentiment from the unrelated AI stock news.  The convergence of predictions around 0.5 suggests that the news has minimal impact on Apple's stock price."

                                    "reasoning": "The news article discusses Dan Ives' top picks for 2025, including Apple Inc. (AAPL), with a mixed outlook. Ives is generally bullish on Apple, citing the potential for an iPhone supercycle with the new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence. However, the article also expresses some concerns, questioning whether Apple Intelligence provides enough value to prompt users to upgrade their phones, given that Apple's devices are considered luxury items and users may not feel compelled to upgrade if their current iPhone is still functional. Considering the mixed sentiment and the previous predictions from various models, the probabilities are estimated with a slight tilt towards a potential rise in stock price, as the analyst's positive view seems to outweigh the concerns."

Despite the mixed sentiments and concerns raised in previous predictions, the bullish analyst view by Dan Ives, who cites the potential for an iPhone supercycle with the new iPhone 16, provides a positive signal. The previous predictions have shown a relatively balanced mix, with slight variations around the 0.5 mark for both rising and falling probabilities. Taking into account the overall cautious optimism and the mixed signals present in the news, it is reasonable to estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some models assigning a higher probability to a price rise due to general positive sentiment towards Apple, while others see the headline as having negligible impact.  Considering the lack of concrete news and the inherent volatility of the stock market, I'm assigning a probability closer to neutral, slightly weighted towards a rise due to the generally positive perception of Apple.  The previous predictions, while varied, do not provide strong evidence of any significant positive or negative news impacting Apple's stock price beyond general market sentiment."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The headline implies that investing a small amount could lead to significant returns, which typically increases investor interest and could drive up demand for the stock. Previous predictions from various models suggest a range of probabilities, with many trending towards a higher probability of a stock price rise. The speculation around Apple's upcoming iPhone 16 and AI features adds to the positive sentiment, although there is some mixed sentiment due to doubts about the impact of AI features. Overall, considering the positive general perception and the speculative nature of the headline, there is a reasonable expectation that the stock price could rise."

While it might generate some positive sentiment, it's unlikely to be a significant driver of short-term price movements.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting this lack of concrete news.  Many models lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the generally positive perception of Apple and the speculative nature of the headline. However, this positive sentiment is not strongly supported by the news itself.  Considering the lack of concrete news and the inherent volatility of the stock market, a neutral prediction with a slight bias towards a rise is appropriate, reflecting the overall market sentiment towards Apple rather than a direct reaction to this headline. The convergence of predictions around 0.6 for a price rise and 0.4 for a price fall across multiple rounds suggests a reasonable estimate."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

The previous predictions show a range of opinions, reflecting this lack of concrete news.  Many models lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price rise due to the generally positive perception of Apple and the speculative nature of the headline. However, this positive sentiment is not strongly supported by the news itself.  Considering the lack of concrete news and the inherent volatility of the stock market, a neutral prediction with a slight bias towards a rise is appropriate, reflecting the overall market sentiment towards Apple rather than a direct reaction to this headline. The convergence of predictions around 0.6 for a price rise and 0.4 for a price fall across multiple rounds suggests a reasonable estimate.  I'm adjusting slightly based on the overall trend towards a slightly higher probability of a rise, but acknowledging the lack of strong evidence from the headline itself."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Therefore, I concur with the assessment that this headline is unlikely to significantly influence Apple's stock price in the short term.

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While Apple is included in the list, the analyst expresses hesitation regarding Apple's prospects, citing concerns about the market impact of its new AI features, 'Apple Intelligence', and suggesting that the value proposition for consumers to upgrade might be insufficient.  The analyst notes that Apple was late to the AI game and that existing iPhone users might not find the new features compelling enough to justify a costly upgrade. This cautious outlook contrasts with the more bullish assessments of other companies in the list. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price fall or stagnation, although the overall impact is likely to be relatively small given the limited nature of the news and the already high valuation of Apple."

However, the negative sentiment around AI stocks could have a spillover effect on AAPL, given its involvement in AI technologies.

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While included in a list of top picks for 2025 by a Wall Street analyst, the analyst expresses reservations about the impact of Apple's new AI features on driving significant upgrades.  This cautious assessment, coupled with the already high valuation of Apple, suggests a lower probability of a significant price increase.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some leaning towards a price rise and others towards a fall or stagnation. Considering the mixed sentiment and the lack of concrete positive news directly impacting Apple's financials, a neutral to slightly negative outlook is warranted. The probabilities are adjusted to reflect this, with a slightly higher probability assigned to a price fall than a price rise, acknowledging the potential for the market to react negatively to the analyst's reservations."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5.

While Apple is a significant holding of Berkshire Hathaway, the news doesn't directly impact Apple's operations or financial performance. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect, influenced by market sentiment towards Berkshire Hathaway's future prospects under new leadership. Given the indirect nature and the lack of specific information about Apple, the probabilities are close to neutral. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight trend towards a more neutral or slightly negative outlook on Apple, so I'll adjust the probabilities accordingly. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, but the overall impact is considered relatively small. Therefore, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a more neutral stance, but with a slight bias towards a fall, considering the general market uncertainty and the fact that the news is about Berkshire Hathaway, not Apple directly."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While included in a list of top picks for 2025, the analyst expresses reservations about the impact of Apple's new AI features on driving significant upgrades. This cautious assessment, coupled with Apple's already high valuation and the lack of concrete positive news directly impacting Apple's financials, suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news' impact.  Considering the mixed sentiment and the lack of overwhelmingly positive factors, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price fall or stagnation.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect this, with a slightly higher probability assigned to a price fall than a price rise, acknowledging the potential for the market to react negatively to the analyst's reservations and the overall uncertainty surrounding the success of Apple Intelligence."

Previous predictions show a mix of opinions, with some models leaning towards a neutral or slightly negative impact, while others consider AAPL's strong fundamentals and diversified product line as mitigating factors.

However, the analyst expresses some concerns about Apple's ability to inspire mass upgrades with its new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence. While the overall sentiment is positive, the mixed outlook introduces uncertainty. Previous predictions show a range of probabilities, with some models favoring a rise and others favoring a fall. Considering the strong brand and historical performance of Apple, along with the mixed sentiments provided by different models, a balanced approach is taken."

However, the lack of specific financial data or context regarding market conditions introduces some uncertainty. Previous predictions show a mix of optimism and caution regarding Apple's future performance, particularly in relation to its AI advancements and product upgrades.

While Apple is a significant holding of Berkshire Hathaway, the news doesn't directly impact Apple's operations or financial performance. The impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be indirect, influenced by market sentiment towards Berkshire Hathaway's future prospects under new leadership. Considering the previous rounds, there's a slight trend towards a more neutral or slightly negative outlook on Apple. The previous rounds show a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a rise and others towards a fall, but the overall impact is considered relatively small. Therefore, I will slightly adjust the probabilities to reflect a more neutral stance, but with a slight bias towards a fall, considering the general market uncertainty and the fact that the news is about Berkshire Hathaway, not Apple directly. Also, the trend of the previous predictions seems to be converging towards a more neutral outlook."

He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5.

While included in a list of top picks for 2025 by a Wall Street analyst, the analyst expresses reservations about the impact of Apple's new AI features on driving significant upgrades. This cautious assessment, coupled with Apple's already high valuation and the lack of concrete positive news directly impacting Apple's financials, suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook in the short term.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news' impact. Considering the mixed sentiment and the lack of overwhelmingly positive factors, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price fall or stagnation. The analyst's hesitation and the already high valuation of Apple contribute to a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance could mitigate some of the negative impact, preventing a significant drop.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect this, with a slightly higher probability assigned to a price fall than a price rise, acknowledging the potential for the market to react negatively to the analyst's reservations and the overall uncertainty surrounding the success of Apple Intelligence."

The strong brand and historical performance of Apple, as well as the potential for the company's AI advancements to drive growth, contribute to a moderate probability of a stock price rise.

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

While included in a list of top picks for 2025 by a Wall Street analyst, the analyst expresses reservations about the impact of Apple's new AI features on driving significant upgrades. This cautious assessment, coupled with Apple's already high valuation and the lack of concrete positive news directly impacting Apple's financials, suggests a neutral to slightly negative outlook in the short term. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the news' impact.  Considering the mixed sentiment and the lack of overwhelmingly positive factors, the probability of a price rise is considered lower than the probability of a price fall or stagnation. The analyst's hesitation and the already high valuation of Apple contribute to a higher probability of a price fall. However, Apple's strong brand and historical performance could mitigate some of the negative impact, preventing a significant drop.  The probabilities are adjusted to reflect this, with a slightly higher probability assigned to a price fall than a price rise, acknowledging the potential for the market to react negatively to the analyst's reservations and the overall uncertainty surrounding the success of Apple Intelligence.  The consistent trend in previous predictions towards a more neutral or slightly negative outlook further supports this assessment."

Given the overall positive sentiment from the headline and the company's strong brand and historical performance, but also considering some analyst's reservations about Apple's AI features and their impact, I estimate a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising. The mixed sentiment and the potential for Apple's strong fundamentals to mitigate some of the negative impact contribute to a balanced outlook."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans.

However, the *previous* rounds of predictions reveal a significant divergence of opinion, suggesting that other, unstated factors are influencing the models' assessments of AAPL's likely price movement.  Many models in previous rounds assigned a higher probability to a price rise, citing positive analyst opinions (Dan Ives) and Apple's strong brand and historical performance.  These positive factors seem to outweigh the negligible impact of the headline news.  While the headline provides no direct reason for a price change, the consistent positive sentiment from other sources in the previous rounds suggests a continued likelihood of a price rise, albeit tempered by the uncertainty introduced by the conflicting predictions. I'm therefore weighting the previous rounds' positive assessments more heavily than the irrelevance of the current headline."

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

                                    "content": "Dan Ives is the managing director and global head of technology research at Wedbush Securities. He is a frequent contributor on financial news programming and actively posts his latest stock predictions on social media.\n\nRecently, Ives published his top picks among megacap technology stocks for 2025. Unsurprisingly, many of his choices are among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nBelow, I'll explore individual catalysts that each of these companies contains and make the case for why 2025 could be a great opportunity to buy these stocks hand over fist.\n\n1. Tesla\n\nTesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is probably the most interesting name on Ives' list. For much of 2024, shares of Tesla underperformed the broader market. But beginning in early November, shares started going parabolic. All told, Tesla stock gained 62% in 2024 -- nearly triple that of the S&P 500 and more than double the gains seen in the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nThe catalyst that fueled Tesla's rebound? The outcome of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nDuring the final months of Donald Trump's campaign, Tesla CEO Elon Musk emerged as a steadfast surrogate for the Republican candidate. Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

However, he also voices some concerns about whether Apple Intelligence provides enough value to prompt upgrades. Considering the generally positive endorsement from a reputable analyst and the mixed sentiment expressed, there's a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising. The previous rounds of predictions show a range of opinions, but many models lean towards a positive outlook for Apple based on other information or previous news.

Following Trump's victory in early November, Ives made it clear that he sees Musk's relationship with the president-elect as a major tailwind for the future of Tesla.\n\nSpecifically, Ives thinks that the incoming Trump administration could fast-track Tesla's autonomous driving and robotaxi plans. While I think Ives' outlook makes sense, it's important to note that a lot of upside has already been factored into Tesla's share price following the election results.\n\n2. Nvidia\n\nIs it really surprising to see Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) listed as a top idea for 2025?\n\nLast year, Nvidia was the top-performing Magnificent Seven stock -- with shares climbing 171% and the company's valuation gaining more than $2 trillion!NVDA data by YCharts\n\nDespite this unprecedented move, Ives is calling for significantly more upside in the chip darling.\n\nThis year, Nvidia's biggest tailwind stems from its newest GPU lineup, known as Blackwell. With industry analysts calling for surging demand for Nvidia's new architecture, 2025 is already looking like another milestone year for the semiconductor leader.\n\nWith a $4 trillion valuation within reach, investors may want to consider scooping up shares of Nvidia now -- before the company begins reporting official stats on Blackwell and its impact on the business.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nI see Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) as one of the safest AI opportunities in big tech. Over the last two years, the company has invested billions into AI infrastructure -- namely through a critically important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMicrosoft has benefited greatly from ChatGPT, primarily by integrating the service into its Azure cloud computing ecosystem. Despite intense competition from the likes of Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle, Microsoft has been able to command respectable growth tied directly to its AI initiatives -- a trend that I think is only just beginning to bear fruit.\n\nIn addition, Microsoft also has an early lead in one of AI's next big megatrends, agentic AI. The company's agentic AI virtual assistant, called CoPilot, is used by almost 70% of the Fortune 500.\n\nTo me, Microsoft has demonstrated an ability to maneuver around the competitive landscape and deserves to be a top choice for AI investors.Image source: Getty Images.\n\n4. Apple\n\nWhile Ives has remained bullish on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) for some time, I have my concerns. According to Ives, Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence should inspire customers to upgrade their devices en masse. Although the idea of an iPhone supercycle makes sense, I question how it will play out in reality.\n\nApple was late to the AI game, and I'm not sure if Apple Intelligence provides enough value add to cause users to upgrade their phones. Remember, Apple's consumer hardware devices are a bit of a luxury. If your old iPhone is still manageable, Apple's AI features might not be enough of a selling point to assume a higher-cost device.\n\nWhile I'd love to be proven wrong on this one, Apple is the one stock on this list that I'm hesitant about right now.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nTo me, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the biggest bargain among the five AI stocks I've explored. Similar to Microsoft, Alphabet has a deep ecosystem in which it can integrate all sorts of AI-powered services -- from cloud computing to workplace productivity tools, advertising, streaming, consumer hardware, and more.\n\nAlphabet is an extremely diversified business, and the company's revenue and profit growth are both headed in the right direction.GOOGL Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nYet, despite the company's impressive growth and lucrative AI opportunities, Alphabet only trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 21.9 -- that's lower than the average forward P/E of the S&P 500.\n\nI think investors are remaining overly cautious when it comes to Alphabet, given the intense competition in the cloud space from Microsoft and Amazon, as well as rising competitive forces in advertising from social media platforms offered by Meta Platforms and TikTok.\n\nWhile I understand these concerns in theory, I think Alphabet's financial results depicted above speak for themselves. To me, an investment in Alphabet will continue to outperform that of the broader market for years to come. I think Alphabet stock is an outright bargain right now and see an opportunity for long-term investors to buy the stock hand over fist.\n\nDon\u2019t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks?

(AAPL) as one of the top 5 'Magnificent Seven' stocks to buy in 2025, according to Dan Ives, a well-respected analyst at Wedbush Securities. Ives expresses a bullish outlook on Apple's new iPhone 16 equipped with Apple Intelligence, expecting it to drive upgrades. However, he also voices some concerns about whether Apple Intelligence provides enough value to prompt upgrades. Considering the generally positive endorsement from a reputable analyst and the mixed sentiment expressed, there's a moderate to high probability of the stock price rising. The previous rounds of predictions show a range of opinions, but many models lean towards a positive outlook for Apple based on other information or previous news. Given this context, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."
