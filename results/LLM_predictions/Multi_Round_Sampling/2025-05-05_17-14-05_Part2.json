This suggests proactive management and potential growth opportunities in new markets. While challenges in China are a concern, the focus on emerging markets signals a potential for future revenue streams and could be viewed positively by investors. However, the success of these efforts is not guaranteed, and depends on execution and competition in those regions. The market reaction will likely depend on the market's larger view on Apple's global diversification and the growth prospects in these emerging markets. Based on the tone and the topic, the market is likely to view this information positively, though not significantly. I'd predict market optimism is slightly higher than pessimism."

However, Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, downplayed this concern, attributing past high sales to the COVID-19 period and emphasizing future opportunities.  This suggests a degree of uncertainty. While the missing refresh cycle could negatively impact short-term sales figures, Cook's optimistic outlook and the continued focus on new product opportunities mitigate the potential for a significant negative market reaction.  The overall market sentiment towards Apple and its long-term prospects remains largely positive. Therefore, the probability of a stock price rise is slightly higher than a fall, but the uncertainty warrants probabilities closer to even."

Apple's stock price movement will likely be influenced by its earnings results, which are a significant driver of investor sentiment. Historically, Apple's earnings reports have led to notable stock price movements, depending on whether they meet, exceed, or fall short of expectations.

The CEO's response focuses on future opportunities rather than addressing the current cycle's impact. This could lead to investor concerns about the company's short-term performance, potentially causing the stock price to fall. However, the emphasis on future opportunities and the historical context of Apple's product cycles might mitigate severe declines or even lead to a rise if investors interpret the news as an expected fluctuation.

Since Tim Cook's statement is neutral and does not explicitly state that Apple will be collaborating or directly benefiting from DeepSeek, the impact on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal. However, the fact that the CEO is open to innovation and views efficiency-driven technology positively may be perceived as a mildly positive sentiment. As a result, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but both probabilities are close to being equal due to the lack of concrete information about the potential impact of DeepSeek on Apple's business."

This mixed signal could lead to investor uncertainty. While the missing refresh cycle could negatively impact short-term sales figures, Cook's optimistic outlook mitigates the potential for a significant negative market reaction. Given the neutral to slightly negative tone and the emphasis on future opportunities, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, but with significant uncertainty."

However, Apple's CEO downplayed this concern, emphasizing future opportunities and attributing past high sales to the COVID-19 period. This creates uncertainty.  The previous predictions are quite diverse, ranging from a high probability of a price rise (0.75 in Round 0) to a high probability of a price fall (0.65 in Round 0).  The consensus seems to shift slightly towards a rise in subsequent rounds, but with significant uncertainty remaining.  The lack of concrete negative news, coupled with Apple's strong market position and brand reputation, makes a significant drop less likely.  The CEO's attempt to manage expectations by focusing on future opportunities rather than directly addressing the sales cycle issue suggests a strategic communication approach to mitigate negative investor sentiment. Considering the mixed signals and the evolving predictions, I'm assigning a slightly higher probability to a price rise, reflecting the overall positive sentiment towards Apple. But the uncertainty and the potential for near-term sales softness warrants a probability closer to 0.6 than 0.7."

                                    "reasoning": "The news regarding Apple's 'missing refresh cycle' presents a mixed picture. While a slowdown in iPhone sales based on a historical pattern is a potential concern, Tim Cook's optimistic outlook and emphasis on future opportunities mitigate the negative impact.  The significant installed base of Apple devices (over 2.35 billion) and the company's strategic focus on emerging markets present considerable growth potential.  Analyzing the previous predictions across multiple models and rounds reveals a trend towards cautious optimism.  Initially, there was a wide range of probabilities, but subsequent rounds show a convergence towards a higher probability of a price rise.  However, the uncertainty surrounding the iPhone sales cycle and the overall economic climate prevent a significantly high probability for a price rise. The consensus leans towards a positive outlook, but with a degree of risk acknowledged.  Therefore, a probability slightly above 0.5 for a price rise is deemed reasonable."

My analysis leans towards a positive outlook for Apple, with a balanced risk factor."

EPS came in at $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.24% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.36, the EPS surprise was +1.69%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China: $18.51 billion compared to the $22.16 billion average estimate based on two analysts. The reported number represents a change of -11.1% year over year. Geographic Revenue- Europe: $33.86 billion compared to the $31.05 billion average estimate based on two analysts. The reported number represents a change of +11.4% year over year. Geographic Revenue- Rest of Asia Pacific: $10.29 billion versus $9.91 billion estimated by two analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +1.3% change. Geographic Revenue- Japan: $8.99 billion compared to the $7.71 billion average estimate based on two analysts. The reported number represents a change of +15.7% year over year. Geographic Revenue- Americas: $52.65 billion compared to the $52.23 billion average estimate based on two analysts. The reported number represents a change of +4.4% year over year. Net Sales- Products: $97.96 billion versus the seven-analyst average estimate of $97.64 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +1.6%. Net Sales- Services: $26.34 billion versus the seven-analyst average estimate of $26.18 billion. The reported number represents a year-over-year change of +13.9%. Revenue- Mac: $8.99 billion versus $8.33 billion estimated by six analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +15.5% change. Revenue- iPhone: $69.14 billion versus $69.19 billion estimated by six analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a -0.8% change. Revenue- Wearables, Home and Accessories: $11.75 billion compared to the $12.55 billion average estimate based on six analysts. The reported number represents a change of -1.7% year over year. Revenue- iPad: $8.09 billion versus $7.39 billion estimated by six analysts on average. Compared to the year-ago quarter, this number represents a +15.2% change.

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2024 earnings showed a slight beat on both revenue and EPS compared to analyst estimates. However, a closer look at the geographic and product-line revenue reveals a mixed picture. While some segments like Europe and Japan showed strong growth, Greater China experienced a significant decline.  The iPhone, Apple's flagship product, saw a slight year-over-year decrease in revenue, despite meeting analysts' estimates.  Other segments like Wearables, Home, and Accessories missed expectations.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating further suggests near-term underperformance. Although the earnings beat is positive, the mixed performance across segments and the negative Zacks ranking suggest that the market's reaction might be muted or even negative. Considering the mixed results and negative Zacks ranking, the probability of a price fall is estimated to be higher than the probability of a price rise."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments",

EPS came in at $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.24% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.36, the EPS surprise was +1.69%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China: $18.51 billion compared to the $22.16 billion average estimate based on two analysts.

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2024 earnings report shows a mixed bag. While it beat EPS and revenue expectations slightly, a deeper dive reveals concerns.  The significant decline in Greater China revenue (-11.1% YoY) is a major negative.  Although other geographic regions showed growth, the overall picture is less robust than initially perceived. iPhone revenue was essentially flat YoY, a key point of concern given its significance to Apple's overall revenue.  The Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment also missed expectations. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) further adds to the bearish sentiment. While the Services segment performed well (+13.9% YoY) and some product lines like Mac and iPad showed strong growth, the weakness in other key areas, particularly in the crucial Chinese market, outweighs these positives. The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions. However, considering the mixed performance across segments, the negative Zacks rating, and the significant downturn in the Chinese market, the probability of a price fall appears higher than a rise in the immediate term."

This low growth expectation could negatively impact the stock price.

Additionally, the predictions from other models indicate a range of opinions, with some models predicting a higher probability of a price rise due to positive factors such as Warren Buffett's investment and Apple's involvement in AI, while others predict a higher probability of a price fall due to low iPhone growth expectations and mixed financial performance.

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments",

For Apple specifically, the news highlights tepid quarterly revenue growth due to increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to AI-enhanced features. Although Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers, tepid growth expectations may weigh on investor sentiment, while positive sentiments from some positive earnings news and past forecasts may support a slightly more optimistic view."

This could cause concerns about supply chain issues and production capabilities. Previous predictions lean towards increased uncertainty and mixed signals, with factors such as Apple's strong earnings and resilient service sectors partially mitigating concerns. However, the predictions still show a higher probability of stock price decline, as many models highlight weak iPhone sales and mixed financial performance. Considering this context, I estimate the probability of the stock price falling to be higher than that of it rising."

The after-hours stock rise further confirms this initial positive market sentiment. However, declining iPhone sales are a significant concern, pointing to potential demand issues. The previous rounds show varied sentiment. Models emphasizing Buffett's potential investment in Apple due to AI see a higher probability of rise, while those focused on weaker iPhone sales and Chinese market performance lean towards a higher probability of fall. Given the earnings beat and initial positive reaction, but acknowledging the underlying iPhone sales decline and previous trends, I adjust my prediction to reflect a slightly higher probability of the stock rising compared to previous rounds, but not overwhelmingly so. Investors might focus on the strong earnings now, but the concern about iPhones will linger. Therefore, a strong rise isn't expected, limiting the possible upside. I'm also weighing in that some of the older predictions are now outdated since the information is now more widespread."

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2024 earnings report presents a mixed picture. While the company beat EPS and revenue expectations slightly, several factors suggest caution.  The significant decline in Greater China revenue (-11.1% YoY) is a major concern, offsetting positive performance in other regions.  Flat YoY iPhone revenue, despite meeting expectations, signals potentially weakening demand for their flagship product.  The underperformance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment further dampens the positive aspects of the report.  The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating adds to the negative sentiment. While the Services segment showed strong growth (+13.9% YoY) and some product lines like Mac and iPad performed well, the overall picture isn't overwhelmingly positive.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, reflecting the ambiguity of the situation. Considering the mixed results, the negative Zacks rating, and the significant weakness in the crucial Chinese market, I place a slightly higher probability on a price fall in the short term. However, the earnings beat and strong service sector growth provide a counterbalance."

                                    "headline": "Futures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets",
                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector as a whole, including Apple's earnings, Microsoft and Meta's defensiveness on AI spending, Tesla's efforts to slash costs and introduce cheaper EV models, and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. For Apple specifically, the news highlights tepid quarterly revenue growth due to increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to AI-enhanced features. Although Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers, tepid growth expectations may weigh on investor sentiment, while positive sentiments from some positive earnings news and past forecasts may support a slightly more optimistic view. Considering previous predictions showing a mix of optimism and pessimism, my assessment leans towards a slightly higher probability of a fall."

This could lead to concerns about supply chain issues and impacts on production capabilities. Furthermore, previous predictions showcased mixed sentiments, with some factors, such as strong earnings in other areas and Warren Buffett's investment, hinting at positive sentiment. However, the overall backdrop of declining iPhone sales and mixed performance in critical markets, especially China, generate bearish sentiment outweighing the positives. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising."

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's recent earnings report presents a mixed bag. They beat earnings targets and matched sales expectations, which is generally positive. However, the decline in iPhone sales is a major concern and could signal weakening demand. The initial positive reaction in extended trading needs to be considered, but the underlying issue with iPhone sales remains. Previous predictions show a lot of variance, reflecting the complexity of the situation. Those focusing on the Warren Buffet connection are more positive, while those highlighting the iPhone sales decline and Chinese market weakness are more negative. My analysis puts slightly more weight on the negative aspects because relying on services to carry the company is not a sustainable strategy in the long run. The iPhone is still a key driver, and a decline signals potential problems ahead. Furthermore, recent model predicitons indicate a trend toward higher probablity towards stock price falling. Thus, even after considering the earnings beat, the issues surrounding iPhone sales will eventually weight down the stock price."

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2024 earnings report presents a mixed picture. While the company slightly beat EPS and revenue expectations, several key factors point to potential downward pressure on the stock price.  The significant decline in Greater China revenue (-11.1% YoY) is a major concern, highlighting weakening demand in a critical market.  Although other geographic regions showed growth, this negative impact is substantial. Flat YoY iPhone revenue, despite meeting expectations, signals potentially weakening demand for their flagship product, which is crucial for Apple's overall performance. Underperformance in the Wearables, Home, and Accessories segment further adds to the negative sentiment. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating reinforces this bearish outlook.  While the Services segment showed impressive growth (+13.9% YoY) and some product lines like Mac and iPad performed well, these positives are outweighed by the weaknesses in other key areas.  Previous predictions from various AI models were also considered and showed a wide range of opinions, mostly indicating a higher chance of a price fall.

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments",

For Apple specifically, the news highlights tepid quarterly revenue growth due to increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to AI-enhanced features. Although Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers, tepid growth expectations may weigh on investor sentiment, while positive sentiments from some positive earnings news and past forecasts may support a slightly more optimistic view. Considering previous predictions showing a mix of optimism and pessimism, my assessment leans towards a slightly higher probability of a fall."

This could lead to concerns about supply chain issues and impacts on production capabilities. Previous predictions show a higher probability of the stock price falling due to declining iPhone sales and mixed performance from other segments, particularly in the critical Chinese market. While there are some bullish sentiments due to strong earnings in other areas and investor interest possibly spurred by Warren Buffett's investment in AI stocks, the overall context is more bearish.

While the services sector shows strength, reliance on a single sector isn't a sustainable growth strategy. Furthermore, the mixed performance in key markets such as China adds to the uncertainty. The previous model predictions reflect this uncertainty, with varying probabilities assigned to stock price movement. Overall, even considering the initial positive market reaction, the negative aspects such as the faltering iPhone sales and inconsistent regional performance raise serious concerns about the immediate future. Most predictive models have also gradually shifted to a higher probability of a stock price fall in the previous rounds. Thus, my assessment is weighted significantly towards a higher probability of a price decline."

                                    "reasoning": "Apple's Q1 2024 earnings reveal a mixed bag. While the company slightly beat revenue and EPS expectations, several key concerns emerge.  The significant decline in Greater China revenue (-11.1% YoY) is a major negative, offsetting positive performance in other regions. Flat YoY iPhone revenue, although meeting estimates, signals potentially weakening demand for their flagship product.  Underperformance in Wearables, Home, and Accessories further dampens the positive aspects. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) adds to the negative sentiment.  While Services showed strong growth (+13.9% YoY) and Mac/iPad performed well, these positives are outweighed by the weaknesses in other key areas.  The previous predictions from various AI models show a wide range of opinions, but a trend towards a higher probability of a price fall is evident.  Considering the overall picture \u2013 the weak Chinese market, flat iPhone sales, and negative Zacks rating \u2013 the probability of a price fall seems higher than a rise in the short term.  Although the earnings beat and strong service sector growth provide some counterbalance, the underlying weaknesses are significant enough to dampen the positive impact."

                                    "content": "Investing.com - U.S. stock futures climb following fresh quarterly reports from a slew of Big Tech companies, including Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Executives at these firms back a spike in artificial intelligence spending despite worries over the strategy in the wake of the emergence of a cut-price Chinese AI model earlier this week. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) aims to reduce costs and roll out a new, cheaper electric vehicle this year to combat flagging demand, while the Fed opts to take a wait-and-see approach to future policy moves.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures ticked higher on Thursday, as investors assessed a raft of earnings from mega-cap tech companies and poured over monetary policy comments from the Federal Reserve.\n\nBy 03:55 ET (08:55 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 162 points or 0.4%, S&P 500 futures had risen by 31 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had advanced by 168 points or 0.8%.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street all slipped in the prior session following the Fed's widely-anticipated decision to press pause on a series of borrowing cost cuts. Policymakers also signaled that they will take a wait-and-see attitude to any potential reductions in the future, pushing up US government bond yields and denting equities (more below).\n\nStocks were also pulled lower by technology shares, including artificial intelligence-darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which dropped by 4.1%. The slide came two days after a global sell-off sparked by the emergence of a low-cost AI model from Chinese start-up DeepSeek that raised questions over major tech groups' massive AI spending plans.\n\n2. Microsoft, Meta CEOs on DeepSeek\n\nDespite these concerns, executives at software giant Microsoft and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms moved to defend the spending as a way to maintain competitiveness in the race to monetize AI.\n\nThe rise in popularity of DeepSeek's free AI model was a key issue for analysts as they parsed through quarterly returns from these companies. DeepSeek has said it built the model using less-advanced chips and for only around $6 million, a claim that has been sharply questioned but has still fueled worries around the necessity of the billions of dollars in AI investments being pursued by American tech giants.\n\nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella told analysts in a post-earnings call that AI costs are decreasing, while Meta boss Mark Zuckerberg argued that shelling out heavily on capital expenditures will prove to be a \"strategic advantage\" over time.\n\nShares in Microsoft fell in extended hours trading after the company's third-quarter outlook for its crucial Azure cloud computing unit disappointed expectations.\n\nStory Continues\n\nMeta's stock price, on the other hand, rose after-hours on better-than-estimated fourth-quarter revenue, although it flagged that current-quarter sales may not meet expectations.\n\n3. Tesla pushes to slash costs, roll out cheaper EV model\n\nElectric vehicle giant Tesla noted that it was driving to slash costs and roll out a cheaper EV model, giving lift to its shares in extended hours dealmaking.\n\nTesla, which logged a decline in deliveries last year, said it is moving to launch its new low-cost EV in the first half of 2025 in a bid to help boost demand. CEO Elon Musk has previously projected that vehicle sales would grow by 20% to 30% this year, although the company did not reiterate the estimate in its latest earnings.\n\nTesla added that the average cost for constructing its cars hit an all-time low in the fourth quarter thanks in part to falling raw material expenses.\n\nQuarterly profit margin from vehicle sales, stripping out regulatory credits, came in at 13.59%, according to calculations from Reuters. Wall Street analysts had seen the figure at 16.2%, Reuters added, citing Visible Alpha data. Tesla has offered less expensive financing to support demand, but analysts have flagged that this could eat into margins.\n\nElsewhere, Musk said Tesla would begin testing a paid autonomous vehicle service in June. He has targeted Tesla's driver assistance software, as well as AI, as key sources of support for the business in the future.\n\n4. Apple to report\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is due to report after the bell on Thursday, with the iPhone manufacturer tipped to unveil tepid quarterly revenue growth.\n\nThe California tech group has faced intensifying competition in its major Chinese market, possibly denting sales during the holiday shopping period.\n\nIt has also been slowly introducing AI-enhanced features on its handsets. An improved version of its Siri voice assistant is not expected to be available until later this year in some regions, while initial reviews for its Apple Intelligence offering have received \"mixed-to-poor reviews\", analysts at Vital Knowledge said.\n\nThe analysts also flagged in a note to clients that the lukewarm reception to Apple Intelligence may suggest that the product \"won't be a huge driver of iPhone sales\".\n\nHowever, Apple is still less exposed to the emergence of DeepSeek's AI model than its other Big Tech peers who have invested heavily in AI, according to analysts at Baird.\n\nIn a note to clients, the analysts said the firm, as a \"leading\" manufacturer of consumer-facing products, is \"well-positioned\" to benefit from so-called generative AI \"without spending tens of billions of dollars on large language models or infrastructure\".\n\nApple said fiscal fourth-quarter payments for property and equipment -- a gauge of capital expenditures -- rose by $2.91 billion to $9.45 billion. The amount was relatively more modest than the plans put forward by rivals like Microsoft and Meta Platforms, partly because Apple uses third-party data centers for some of its AI work.\n\n5. Fed leaves rates steady; ECB decision ahead\n\nThe Fed held interest rates steady at a range of 4.25% to 4.5% on Wednesday, while Chair Jerome Powell said officials were in no rush to cut borrowing costs again.\n\nUnderpinned by a recent set of solid U.S. economic data and lingering uncertainties surrounding the wider outlook, officials chose to place monetary policy on a holding pattern.\n\nHowever, decisions on tariffs, taxes, and immigration by the new Trump administration could factor once again into the Fed's plans. Some economists have predicted the moves could place renewed upward pressure on inflation, which remains above the Fed's stated 2% target level.\n\nSpeaking in a press conference, Powell said he believed the Fed had a \"very well-calibrated\" policy stance supported by a \"broadly stable\" employment picture and \"more positive\" inflation readings. As such, the Fed sees no cause to adjust rates again until data shows risks to the job market or a fresh drop in inflation.\n\nPowell added that the Fed's calls were not motivated by politics -- a comment that came after Trump criticized the central bank and urged policymakers to cut rates.\n\nElsewhere, the European Central Bank is expected to slash rates on Thursday as policymakers look to revive sluggish economic activity in the Eurozone currency area. The ECB previously lowered rates four times in 2024, noting that a steep climb in inflation in recent years was almost finished.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher; tech earnings in focus; Fed decision - what's moving markets\n\nFinland's Nordea Bank just beats Q4 estimates on \"slow\" lending market recovery\n\nExclusive-Thailand's economy may underperform from weak consumption, warns central bank chief\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news covers multiple aspects affecting the tech sector as a whole, including Apple's earnings, Microsoft and Meta's defensiveness on AI spending, Tesla's efforts to slash costs and introduce cheaper EV models, and the Federal Reserve's stance on interest rates. For Apple specifically, the news highlights tepid quarterly revenue growth due to increased competition in China and lukewarm reception to AI-enhanced features. Although Apple is less exposed to AI investments compared to its peers, tepid growth expectations may weigh on investor sentiment, while positive sentiments from some positive earnings news and past forecasts may support a slightly more optimistic view. Considering previous predictions showing a mix of optimism and pessimism, my assessment leans towards a slightly higher probability of a fall."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                                    "reasoning": "While Apple beat both earnings and revenue estimates for the quarter, several factors suggest a cautious outlook. Firstly, the company has underperformed the S&P 500 YTD. Secondly, the Zacks Rank is currently #4 (Sell), indicating anticipated underperformance based on unfavorable earnings estimate revisions leading up to the report. The industry Apple belongs to also has a below-average ranking. This suggests the sector might face headwinds. Management commentary in the earnings call will be critical. While beating estimates is positive, the analysts expectations are pessimistic. Therefore the current surprise may not continue moving forward. Factoring these elements into account, I believe that there is still a high chance of the stock falling. "

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "The news is mixed. While Apple reported 6% revenue growth driven by new products and AI integration, the broader context is negative.  Hedge funds are reducing their tech positions due to concerns about competition from Chinese AI startups (like DeepSeek) and regulatory uncertainty.  Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish long-term outlook on AI, but short-term market sentiment seems bearish regarding US tech stocks.  Apple's positive Q4 earnings are a counterpoint to this broader negative sentiment, but the overall market reaction to the general AI sector news likely outweighs the positive impact of Apple's individual performance in the short term.  Therefore, the probability of a stock price fall is deemed slightly higher than the probability of a rise, reflecting the current market headwinds impacting even strong performers in the tech sector."

However, the article also mentions that other major tech companies, such as Tesla and Meta, have reported mixed results, with Tesla missing earnings estimates but rising on growth projections, and Meta topping profit forecasts. Given that Apple is a major player in the tech industry, its stock price may be influenced by the overall sentiment and trends in the sector. Since the news about other companies is mixed, it is difficult to predict the direction of Apple's stock price movement with certainty. Nevertheless, the fact that Apple's report is scheduled for release soon may lead to increased volatility and speculation, which could result in a slight increase in the probability of the stock price rising if the report is expected to be positive, but this is highly uncertain."

Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT.

Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts.

Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri.

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company has underperformed the S&P 500 year-to-date. The Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) suggests potential near-term underperformance due to unfavorable earnings estimate revisions. Additionally, Apple's industry rank is in the bottom 28%, signaling headwinds for the sector. While beating estimates is a positive sign, the negative sentiment reflected in the Zacks Rank and industry outlook cannot be ignored. The estimates that lead to the sell rating are still there even after the earnings release.

While Apple's strong performance is a positive factor, the overall market headwinds likely have a stronger influence in the short term. Considering the mixed signals and the previous predictions, a neutral to slightly positive outlook seems appropriate.  The previous predictions ranged widely (0.4 to 0.75 for a price rise), indicating uncertainty.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Dan Niles: Apple (AAPL) Bulls \u2018Trying to Pretend\u2019 an Upgrade Cycle is Coming\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's industry also has a below-average ranking. The estimate revisions trend before the earnings release were unfavorable, further suggesting that the stock might underperform. The management's commentary on the earnings call will be crucial. Considering these mixed signals, I slightly tilt towards the stock price falling, but the earnings beat prevents a strong negative prediction. Previous rounds show a decrease in optimism from round 0 to round 1, with predictions varying widely.

This positive performance, driven by new product launches and AI integration, is a bullish signal.  However, the broader market context presents a mixed picture. Hedge funds are reducing their tech holdings due to concerns about Chinese AI competition and regulatory uncertainty. While Goldman Sachs holds a positive long-term view on AI, short-term market sentiment for US tech seems bearish.  The previous predictions show a range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty.  Apple's positive Q4 results are a significant positive factor, but the negative broader tech sector sentiment and the uncertainty surrounding the future impact of AI competition need to be considered. Weighing these factors, a slightly higher probability is assigned to a stock price rise due to the company's strong performance, but the overall market headwinds and uncertainty reduce this probability from a more optimistic assessment. The consensus from previous models also contributes to this more moderate prediction."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025.

While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "reasoning": "Apple reported strong Q4 2024 revenue growth (6%), exceeding expectations, driven by new product launches and AI integration. This is a positive indicator. However, the news also highlights a broader cautious sentiment in the tech sector due to increased competition from Chinese AI startups, regulatory uncertainty, and hedge funds reducing their tech positions. While Goldman Sachs maintains a bullish long-term outlook on AI, the short-term market sentiment seems more bearish.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of probabilities for a price increase (0.4 to 0.75 initially, converging towards 0.5-0.6 in later rounds), reflecting the uncertainty surrounding the situation.  Considering Apple's strong Q4 results and the positive outlook for AI, but acknowledging the countervailing negative market sentiment and competitive pressures, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price rise than a fall, although I would not assign a high probability to either event.  The overall sentiment remains mixed, making a definitive prediction extremely difficult."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States.

Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Dan Niles: Apple (AAPL) Bulls \u2018Trying to Pretend\u2019 an Upgrade Cycle is Coming\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

Hedge funds are cautious about the tech sector due to Chinese competition and regulatory uncertainty.  Goldman Sachs is bullish long-term on AI, but short-term sentiment is bearish for US tech.  The positive Q4 results are a counterpoint to this broader negative sentiment. Previous model predictions show a range of probabilities, oscillating around 0.5 for both rise and fall.  The overall market headwinds and uncertainty temper the positive impact of Apple's strong Q4 performance. Considering the strong Q4 earnings, positive AI integration and new product success, coupled with the bearish overall market sentiment and broader concerns, I believe the probabilities are fairly balanced, with a slight edge towards a price rise due to Apple's strong fundamentals."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist.

Although some past analyses noted positive sentiments related to AI and other innovations at Apple, the direct impact of STMicroelectronics' forecast is likely to overshadow these aspects in the short term. Therefore, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline because of the potential adverse effects on Apple's supply chain and demand for its products."

While this could negatively impact short-term sales, Cook's focus on future opportunities and the potential for growth in other product categories suggests a more nuanced outlook.  The previous predictions are mixed, ranging from a 25% to 60% probability of a price increase.  The significant variation highlights the uncertainty surrounding the market's reaction. The fact that the missing refresh cycle is acknowledged by Apple suggests it may already be factored into investor expectations.  While a short-term dip is possible, Apple's overall financial strength and brand loyalty could limit the extent of any decline. The lack of a significant negative surprise in the earnings report (mentioned in previous predictions, though details aren't fully provided here) further suggests a less drastic negative impact is likely. Considering the mixed signals and the range of previous predictions, a moderate probability of both price increase and decrease seems appropriate, leaning slightly towards a price increase due to the overall strength of the company and the CEO's forward-looking statements."

This divergence highlights considerable uncertainty in the market's reaction.  Several models cite concerns about weakening demand due to possibly elongating iPhone replacement cycles and competition in China.  However, Apple's overall financial health, brand loyalty, and diversification across products mitigate some of the downside risk.  The lack of a strong negative reaction to the earnings announcement (as hinted at in the previous round's predictions) suggests the market may have already partially priced in a potential sales slowdown.  Considering this, combined with the conflicting predictions and the mixed nature of the news itself, I assign a slightly higher probability to a price decline due to the immediate concern of slower iPhone sales but acknowledge a significant chance of stable or slightly positive movement due to the company's resilience and potential for future growth in other sectors."

However, Apple's strong financial health, brand loyalty, and diversified product portfolio mitigate some of the negative impact. The lack of a dramatic negative reaction to the earnings announcement (as hinted in earlier predictions) suggests the market may have already partially accounted for a possible sales slowdown.  The consistent concern over the semiconductor supply chain, as evidenced by the STMicroelectronics news, adds to the downside pressure. Considering this mix of factors, the overall uncertainty, and the diverse range of previous predictions, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price decline in the short term due to immediate concerns over iPhone sales.

However, it's a very general statement without specific implications for Apple's strategy or partnerships. Most models in previous rounds have leaned slightly negative due to concerns about iPhone sales, competition, and the semiconductor supply chain, although there's also been discussion of positive factors like overall revenue growth and future AI opportunities. Considering that the overall sentiment towards apple has been tepid and this news will most likely not have a huge impact, I will predict probability scores close to each other, but slightly pointing towards a stock price increase. It is also important to note that some previous models, namely openai/gpt-4o-mini, based their prediction on news that were not present in this round, which is improper to the case. It is still important to note others predictions to follow the 'trend of beliefs'."

                                    "reasoning": "The news regarding Apple's 'missing refresh cycle' and slower iPhone sales growth presents a mixed picture. While this is a significant concern given the iPhone's revenue contribution, Cook's focus on future opportunities and potential growth in other product categories offers a counterbalance.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of opinions (from 0.2 to 0.6 probability of a price rise), reflecting substantial uncertainty.  Several models cite concerns about weakening demand due to potentially elongating iPhone replacement cycles and increased competition in China.  However, Apple's strong financial health, brand loyalty, and diverse product portfolio mitigate some of the negative impact. The lack of a dramatic negative reaction to the earnings announcement (as hinted in earlier predictions) suggests the market may have partially priced in a potential sales slowdown. The consistent concern over the semiconductor supply chain, as evidenced by the STMicroelectronics news, adds to the downside pressure. Considering the conflicting signals, overall uncertainty, and diverse previous predictions, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price decline in the short term due to immediate concerns over iPhone sales. However, the likelihood of a significant drop is limited by the company's overall resilience and potential future growth in other areas.  The probabilities are kept relatively close, reflecting the inherent uncertainty, with a slight weighting toward a price decline given the immediate concerns around iPhone sales."

The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, despite this positive news, there are concerns regarding unfavorable estimate revisions and a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting that the stock may underperform in the near future. The overall industry outlook is also weak, with Apple's sector in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. Taking these factors into account, the probability of the stock price falling may be higher than the probability of it rising immediately following this earnings report."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%.

The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

The article highlights Apple's strong performance, with a 262% stock price gain over the last five years, and a forecasted 6% growth rate for 2025. Additionally, Apple's expansive platform for AI services and potential for AI-driven subscription services are seen as positive factors. However, the article also mentions challenges such as declining shipments in China. Overall, the positive factors seem to outweigh the negative, but the cautious tone from Tom Lee's market outlook for 2025, including potential pullbacks, suggests a moderate probability of stock price rise."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%.

The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter.

While it's touted as a good stock for beginners, and highlights positive aspects like revenue growth, a large user base, and AI potential, significant concerns exist.  The decline in Chinese shipments is a major negative, as is the generally cautious market outlook for 2025 predicted by Tom Lee, including a potential second-half pullback.  The article itself acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer better returns, further dampening enthusiasm for AAPL.  Although Apple's inclusion in a list of top stocks and its ongoing revenue growth suggest some upward pressure, the significant challenges and the overall market uncertainty outweigh these positives. The previous predictions range from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, reflecting this inherent uncertainty. Considering all factors, I place a slightly higher probability on a price rise than a price fall, reflecting the balance of positive and negative factors, but acknowledge the considerable uncertainty inherent in this prediction."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%.

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead.

The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%.

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs. These stocks are also popular among hedge funds. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Dan Niles: Apple (AAPL) Bulls \u2018Trying to Pretend\u2019 an Upgrade Cycle is Coming\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for a stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: 20 Best AI Stocks To Buy Now and Complete List of 59 AI Companies Under $2 Billion in Market Cap\n\nDisclosure: None.

The key highlights include a 6% revenue growth in Q4 2024 driven by new product launches and AI integration (Apple Intelligence). Goldman Sachs identifies Apple as an AI superstar and remains bullish on AI futures. However, hedge funds have been reducing their positions in technology stocks, raising concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector due to competition from Chinese AI startup DeepSeek. Regulatory complexities are also contributing to market volatility, leading to a cautious approach from hedge funds. There are some hedge funds taking long positions, but the majority are selling. The previous predictions vary, showing that the information is not definitively leading one direction or the other. Considering the conflicting signals, the increase in the price seems very unlikely. I am lowering my estimated probability of a price increase from the predictions in Round 1."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.

While it's positioned as a good stock for beginners, highlighting positive aspects like revenue growth (6%), a large user base, and AI potential, significant concerns exist. The decline in Chinese shipments (17% annually, 25% in Q4 2024) is a major negative, as is the generally cautious market outlook for 2025 from Tom Lee, including a potential second-half pullback.  The article itself acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer better returns, further dampening enthusiasm for AAPL.  The prediction from various models ranges from 0.4 to 0.6 probability of a price rise, reflecting inherent uncertainty.  While Apple's inclusion in a top stocks list and revenue growth suggest some upward pressure, the significant challenges and market uncertainty outweigh these positives. The overall market sentiment appears slightly positive, but not overwhelmingly so, given the lack of new, compelling financial data beyond revenue growth. Considering past predictions' trend toward slightly lower probabilities of a price increase, and the significant negative aspect of declining Chinese shipments, I'm leaning towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall."

Apple met Wall Street's expectations with earnings and revenues, showing strong performance in the latest quarter. However, they missed their iPhone revenue estimates, which highlights a critical component of their business. The guidance for the following quarter suggests low to mid-single-digit growth, considered modest. Recent analyst actions and concerns about hardware upgrades and consumer adoption of new features could weigh on investor sentiment. Despite some positive aspects, such as AI integration and revenue growth, the overall sentiment leans towards caution due to missed estimates and market concerns."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, despite the positive financial results, there are significant concerns regarding future performance due to unfavorable estimate revisions and a low Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), suggesting the stock may underperform the market in the near term. Additionally, the broader industry outlook remains weak, as the Computer - Micro Computers sector is in the bottom 28% of Zacks industries. Other mixed signals from previous analyses suggest that there is caution in the market regarding future growth, especially with concerns over shipments in China. Overall, this mixture of positive earnings surprises but negative future outlook leads to a higher probability of the stock price falling compared to rising."

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

These worries include hedge funds reducing their technology holdings, which is a significant negative. The emergence of Chinese AI competitors such as DeepSeek also creates uncertainty. Goldman Sachs' bullish perspective on AI is supportive, but regulatory complexities and the cautious approach of hedge funds make it hard to be completely confident. Also, it is noted that AAPL may underperform other peers. The previous rounds of predictions show a convergence around a slightly negative sentiment. Given these factors, I will estimate the probabilities accordingly."

(NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database.

The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter. Analysts expect 2025 to be a robust year for the company, with a 6% forecasted growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, with more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, Apple Inc., (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an expansive platform for AI services. It is set to reveal several of its new Apple Intelligence features in fiscal 2025 and may explore AI-driven subscription services, which could translate to further revenue potential for the company.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Positive aspects include strong services revenue growth (6%), a large installed base of devices providing a platform for AI services, and potential new revenue streams from AI-driven subscriptions.  However, significant headwinds exist, including a substantial decline in Chinese shipments (17% annually, 25% in Q4 2024), a generally cautious market outlook for 2025 with a potential second-half pullback, and the article's own admission that other AI stocks may offer superior returns. The article's ranking of AAPL as only the 3rd best stock further tempers bullish sentiment.  While the positive factors suggest some upward pressure on the stock price, the considerable challenges, particularly the significant drop in Chinese sales and the overall market uncertainty, warrant caution.  The previous predictions from various models showcase this uncertainty, with probabilities ranging widely. Considering the balance of positive and negative factors and the trend in previous predictions toward a slightly lower probability of a price increase, I lean slightly towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the overall uncertainty remains high."

The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%.

This statement suggests that Apple is open to external innovation, which might be perceived positively by investors. However, the overall impact of this statement on Apple's stock price is likely to be minimal, as it does not directly imply any significant changes to the company's financial performance. Considering the mixed predictions from other models and the overall market sentiment, the probability of a significant stock price movement is relatively low. The company's recent earnings report and revenue growth are strong positives, but concerns about China's market, modest growth guidance, and competition from other AI models create uncertainty. Taking into account the neutral to mildly positive tone of the statement and the mixed market sentiment, I estimate the probability of the stock price rising to be slightly higher than the probability of it falling, but not overwhelmingly so."

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

                                    "content": "We recently compiled a list of the Goldman Sachs\u2019 35 AI Superstars.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other AI stocks.\n\nIn September 2024, Peter Oppenheimer, the chief of global equity strategy and the head of macro research for Goldman Sachs in Europe, opined that the rise of tech stocks due to the AI boom was not indicative of a financial bubble. Instead, per the Goldman bigwig, the performance of these companies was expected to continue delivering solid returns to investors, fueled by the rise of AI superstars outside of the magnificent seven, among smaller tech firms and in non-tech sectors. In the months since, the AI hype has only grown stronger, leading to a massive surge in the value of tech offerings, only offset by the recent emergence of Chinese AI startup DeepSeek which is positioning itself as a budget ChatGPT. The success of this Chinese startup, popularized by the downloads that the DeepSeek application has achieved on the mobile operating system markets, has led to a downward spiral in American tech futures.\n\nAlthough the tech sector selloff has caught many investors by surprise, a new investor note by Goldman Sachs, as seen by news agency Reuters, contends that hedge funds were already anticipating this slump. Per the Goldman report, in the last two weeks, hedge funds have significantly reduced their positions in technology stocks. This retreat is part of a broader trend, as hedge funds have remained hesitant to reinvest in tech-related sectors following the sell-off from June to August last year. Alongside selling major technology stocks, hedge funds have also been offloading shares in adjacent industries, such as power and energy companies that would benefit from AI advancements\u2014especially those supporting data centers and electric vehicle infrastructure.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 10 Best AI Data Center Stocks and 10 Buzzing AI Stocks According to Goldman Sachs.\n\nHowever, Goldman remains bullish on AI futures. Per Oppenheimer, tech stocks have dominated global and US equity returns since 2010, contributing 32% and 40%, respectively. The Goldman executive further claims that unlike speculative bubbles, these gains are backed by strong financials, with tech sector earnings per share surging 400% since the 2008 financial crisis, compared to a modest 25% increase across other sectors. Hyperscale companies in software and cloud computing have been key drivers of this growth, leveraging their vast resources and high profitability, he notes. Recent AI advancements have further boosted their valuations, concentrating gains among a few market leaders. Oppenheimer highlights that this pattern is consistent with past technological innovations, where capital inflows and competition drive rapid growth before eventual consolidation.\n\nStory Continues\n\nWhile dominant AI companies today were also leaders in the previous tech wave, new competitors are emerging, he predicts. The report further notes that the number of AI patents jumped from 8,000 in 2018 to over 60,000 in 2022, signaling growing competition. History suggests that the companies pioneering a technology may not be the ones to benefit most in the long run, Oppenheimer claims. Just as internet infrastructure investments paved the way for social media and ride-sharing dominance, the greatest value in AI may emerge from new players that leverage current advancements in unexpected ways, per the Goldman strategist. The Oppenheimer point of view is echoed in the latest Goldman report. This report highlights that over the past year, hedge funds have been more inclined to sell rather than buy stocks that would typically gain value from a US-driven AI boom.\n\nRead more about these developments by accessing 30Most Important AI Stocks According to BlackRock and Beyond the Tech Giants: 35 Non-Tech AI Opportunities.\n\nHowever, a smaller group of hedge funds has maintained long positions, meaning they are betting that stock values will rise. In fact, these hedge funds currently hold the highest number of long positions in two years, indicating some confidence in future AI-driven growth, the report adds. Goldman underlines that the investment climate in AI has been heavily influenced by substantial spending from major US technology firms. Following the success of ChatGPT, companies have invested tens of billions of dollars in AI infrastructure. Notably, OpenAI and SoftBank recently committed $19 billion to fund Stargate, a joint venture aimed at developing AI data centers in the United States. Despite these large-scale investments, competition from international players such as Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has raised concerns about the long-term sustainability of US leadership in the AI sector.\n\nBruno Schneller, managing director at Erlen Capital Management, noted that hedge funds are adopting a cautious wait-and-see approach toward US AI-related stocks. Schneller further highlighted that large projects like Stargate come with significant regulatory complexities. The ongoing uncertainty regarding regulatory execution and enforcement has left many investors wary, contributing to the market\u2019s volatility. While the US AI sector continues to receive significant investments, hedge funds remain uncertain about its profitability in the face of growing international competition and regulatory uncertainties. This cautious stance has led to stock market fluctuations, with many hedge funds opting to sell their tech-related holdings while a select few continue to maintain long positions, betting on future growth.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we selected AI stocks by combing through a note on the AI industry by investment bank Goldman Sachs.

(NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a consumer electronics firm. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Apple reported a revenue of $94.9 billion, marking a 6% increase from the same period in the previous year. This growth was attributed to the successful launch of new products, including the iPhone 16 lineup, Apple Watch Series 10, and AirPods 4. Apple has been integrating AI across its product ecosystem to enhance user experience and drive growth. In June 2024, the company introduced Apple Intelligence, a personal intelligence system for iPhone, iPad, and Mac. This system combines generative models with personal context to deliver relevant and useful intelligence to users. By October 2024, Apple Intelligence became available to users, offering features such as writing refinement, notification summaries, and a more natural and capable Siri. These AI-driven enhancements have been well-received, contributing to increased user engagement and satisfaction.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 6th on our list of Goldman Sachs' AI superstars. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%.

While it's touted as a good stock for beginners and highlights positive aspects like revenue growth, a large user base, and AI potential, significant concerns exist. The decline in Chinese shipments is a major negative, as is the generally cautious market outlook for 2025 predicted by Tom Lee, including a potential second-half pullback. The article itself acknowledges that other AI stocks might offer better returns, further dampening enthusiasm for AAPL.  The previous predictions from various models show a wide range of probabilities, reflecting this inherent uncertainty. While Apple's inclusion in a top stocks list and revenue growth suggest some upward pressure, the considerable challenges and market uncertainty outweigh these positives, particularly the significant drop in Chinese sales and the overall cautious market outlook.  The trend in previous predictions is towards a slightly lower probability of a price increase,  further supporting a cautious outlook.  Considering all factors, the probability of a price fall slightly outweighs the probability of a price rise."

While Tesla's earnings missed estimates, its stock rose due to positive growth projections. Microsoft's Azure growth disappointed, and Meta exceeded profit forecasts. All of this suggests a mixed market sentiment for big tech. The critical piece of information is: \"Apple's quarterly report is scheduled for after the closing bell Thursday.\" This means the current prices do not reflect the earnings. The lack of any additional information regarding Apple implies: if their report is positive or surpasses expectations, the stock is likely to rise. Conversely, if the report is negative or misses expectations, the stock will likely fall. Considering that Apple is generally considered a strong company with a history of innovation and relatively stable earnings, I will assume that there's slightly higher chance of positive reporting. Hence, a very slight increase in the probablity of stock price rise. If the Apple's report were already released, then my answer would be based on reported results as was the case for other companies."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Considering the long-term positive implications of the news and the generally positive outlook on Apple, while also acknowledging the inherent uncertainty before earnings, I'm slightly more optimistic.

The varied reactions to those reports (Tesla up despite earnings miss, Microsoft down on Azure growth, Meta up on profit) highlight the uncertainty surrounding earnings. Most past models assigned around a 55/45 split in favor of a rise, reflecting Apple's general stability. The model that predicted a fall did so based on a relatively small recent earnings surprise (+1.69% vs +10.07% QoQ), a Zacks Sell rating, and YTD underperformance. Given that the news explicitly states the report is *after* the bell, it's very hard for the price to move much *before* the report. Because these are pre-earnings predictions and I have no concrete information about the earnings report, but the bulk of signals point slightly positive, I'm weighting my probability a bit higher towards a positive movement. The models predicting on Amazon's X ad spend are basically irrelevant. Since there is no direct positive or negative info for Apple I will assume the news is likely to push for equilibrium towards a long term trend if there is limited time for people to react."

This is a long-term positive, but its immediate impact on stock price is uncertain.  The previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.4 to 0.65 for a price rise, reflecting the market's pre-earnings report uncertainty.  The lack of specific earnings information makes precise prediction difficult. Considering the generally positive long-term outlook for Apple and the proactive nature of their strategy, a slight bias towards a price increase is warranted. However, the significant spread in prior predictions emphasizes the considerable uncertainty.  I'm therefore weighting the probabilities towards the average of the previous rounds' predictions, slightly favoring a rise due to the positive news, while acknowledging the substantial uncertainty inherent in predicting stock price movements before earnings reports."

Considering the mixed predictions from other models, with some indicating a slight inclination towards a price rise and others towards a fall, it's reasonable to assume a neutral to slightly positive bias. The probabilities are not skewed heavily in either direction, as the actual impact of this strategy on earnings and the overall market sentiment will dictate the stock price movement. However, the proactive approach to adapting to changing market conditions and exploring new avenues for growth is likely to be viewed positively by investors."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable.

He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

This could lead to negative sentiment among investors, particularly in the short term.

While the article doesn't provide specific earnings expectations, the projected 1.4% increase falls short of what many investors might hope for. This, coupled with previous years' low iPhone growth (2022-2024), suggests potential for negative market reaction if the actual results meet or slightly undershoot the low projection.  The previous predictions are mixed, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to the iPhone sales concern, and others more optimistic based on Apple's overall financial strength and ecosystem potential.  However, the relatively low projected iPhone growth is a key negative factor that warrants attention. Considering the overall sentiment and the significance of iPhone sales to Apple's revenue, I'm assigning a higher probability to a stock price fall than a rise, but accounting for the potential mitigation factor of Apple's diversified portfolio and overall financial health.  My estimation is a weighted average, acknowledging the potential positive elements but prioritizing the negative impact of slow iPhone sales growth as the most likely near-term event directly related to the news."

Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable.

While total revenue increased, the specific focus on the decline in iPhone sales casts a negative light on the company's short-term outlook. Previous predictions show a mixed sentiment, with several models leaning towards a higher probability of stock price falling, mainly due to disappointing iPhone sales performance. The importance of iPhone sales to overall revenue could outweigh the optimistic outlook brought by Apple's installed user base and ecosystem.

The cross-selling potential cited also supports future revenue growth. The previous round of predictions were mixed, with concerns mainly surrounding iPhone sales. However, this new piece of information addresses overall customer acquisition, which could offset iPhone concerns to some extent. Given the positive nature of attracting new customers and the opportunity to expand sales within the Apple ecosystem, the probability of the stock price rising is slightly favored.\n\nHowever, to discount the previously stated negatives around iPhone sales would be foolish. Although growing the installed base can offset lackluster iPhone sales, it does not fully mitigate them. Additionally, considering the mixed sentiments of previous models, balancing optimism and caution is prudent. Thus, a mild lean towards a rise is suitable here."

This is a significant concern, especially given the low growth observed in the previous two fiscal years.  While Apple possesses a diverse product portfolio and a strong financial position that could mitigate negative impact, the underwhelming iPhone sales projection is a primary driver of uncertainty.  Analysis of previous predictions reveals a mixed sentiment, with some models leaning towards a price fall due to iPhone sales concerns and others more optimistic about Apple's overall strength and potential for cross-selling within its ecosystem. The consensus from those models, however, seems to slightly favor a price decrease.  Considering the importance of iPhone sales and the potential for disappointment if results don't meet even the low expectations, a moderate probability of a price decline is warranted.  However, the potential for mitigation from Apple's overall financial health and other product lines prevents assigning an overwhelmingly negative probability."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is a significant concern, especially given the low growth observed in the previous two fiscal years. While Apple has a diversified portfolio and strong financial position, the underwhelming iPhone sales projection is a primary driver of uncertainty.  Previous models show a mixed sentiment, with a slight lean towards a price decrease due to iPhone sales concerns. However, the potential for mitigation from Apple's overall financial health and other product lines prevents an overwhelmingly negative probability.  The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the impact is likely to be moderate, not extreme. I've weighted the low iPhone sales growth heavily, as it's a direct, near-term concern related to the core of Apple's revenue. The lack of strong positive news in the provided text further reinforces the slightly pessimistic outlook.  Considering all factors, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline than a rise."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank.

At half of total revenue in fiscal 2024, iPhone sales are always paramount in Apple\u2019s financials. Wall Street analysts see only a 1.4% annual increase in iPhone sales from a year before, so it may mean another year of low iPhone growth, like in fiscal 2022 through 2024.\n\nContinue Reading\n\nView Comments",

                                    "reasoning": "The news focuses on the projected low growth of iPhone sales (1.4%), a major revenue driver for Apple, representing half of its fiscal 2024 revenue. This is a significant concern, especially given the low growth observed in the previous two fiscal years. While Apple has a diverse portfolio and strong financial position, the underwhelming iPhone sales projection is a primary driver of uncertainty.  Previous model predictions are mixed, with a slight overall lean towards a price decrease due to iPhone sales concerns.  However, the potential for mitigation from Apple's overall financial health and other product lines prevents an overwhelmingly negative probability.  The consensus leans towards a higher probability of a price fall, but the impact is likely to be moderate, not extreme. I've weighted the low iPhone sales growth heavily, as it's a direct, near-term concern related to the core of Apple's revenue. The lack of strong positive news in the provided text further reinforces the slightly pessimistic outlook.  Considering all factors, including the trend of previous predictions showing a gradual shift towards a higher probability of a fall, I estimate a higher probability of a stock price decline than a rise. The ongoing uncertainty and mixed market sentiment further support a more cautious prediction."

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, the substantial AI investments by competitors, especially Meta's announced $60-$65 billion CAPEX increase, could put pressure on Apple's stock if investors perceive a widening competitive gap in the AI space.

Considering the previous model predictions, there's a mix of opinions, with some models suggesting concern over Apple's approach to AI while others see it as fiscally responsible.

The mention of DeepSeek validating Apple's approach further adds to the ambiguity. Previous predictions are highly varied, ranging from 0.3 to 0.55 probability of a price rise.  The mixed signals and the lack of concrete information make a strong prediction difficult.  Considering the overall uncertainty and the somewhat negative sentiment in several previous predictions (potentially influenced by other undisclosed factors), I lean towards a slightly higher probability of a price fall.

Previous rounds reveal a mixed sentiment, with some models concerned about Apple's AI approach and others highlighting fiscal responsibility. A significant factor is the context from previous rounds, including mentions of a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which is a bearish signal, and revenue misses in some segments. Given the mixed signals and the negative downward pressure from previous predictions. the overall sentiment is still leaning towards a potential price decrease. There is also a forecast sales decline due to weak demand for legacy chips by STMicroelectronics, a supplier for Apple.

While the lower spending compared to peers could be seen as fiscally responsible or a sign of focusing on proven technologies, it also risks portraying Apple as lagging in the rapidly developing AI field.  The validation from DeepSeek partially mitigates this concern, suggesting Apple's current approach may be viable. However, the significant AI investments by competitors like Meta create a potential competitive pressure.  The previous predictions show a wide range of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding the market's reaction.  Some models emphasize the positive aspects of Apple's earnings and revenue beating estimates, while others focus on the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), underperformance in certain segments, and the overall negative trend in the sector.  Considering the conflicting information and the lack of a clear consensus among previous predictive models, I assign a slightly higher probability to the stock price remaining relatively stable, leaning slightly towards a fall due to the competitive AI landscape."

Furthermore, the previous rounds indicate mixed sentiments and a general lean towards a potentially negative view of the stock in the short term, noting a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), underperformance relative to the market, reduced demands from supplies, and some previous underperformance in Greater China and Wearables.

While the lower spending compared to competitors could be viewed positively as fiscally responsible, it also risks making Apple appear less innovative in the rapidly developing AI field.  DeepSeek's validation of Apple's strategy offers some support, but the significant AI investments by competitors, particularly Meta, introduce considerable competitive pressure.  The previous predictions show a notable divergence of opinions, highlighting the uncertainty surrounding market reaction.  Several models cite the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, underperformance in certain segments, and negative industry trends as bearish indicators, outweighing the positive impact of exceeding Q1 earnings and revenue estimates.  The mixed signals from the news itself, combined with the prevailing negative sentiment from other models and the potential for supply chain issues (STMicroelectronics forecast), suggest a higher likelihood of a stock price fall.

This could imply potential supply chain issues or increased costs for Apple, which might negatively impact its production or margins. However, Apple's diversified supply chain and strong brand loyalty could mitigate some of these risks. Given the mixed implications and the previous predictions leaning towards a negative impact, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than a rise. The previous predictions from other models also tend to agree on a higher probability of the stock price falling, with predictions ranging from 0.45 to 0.7 for the probability of the stock price falling.

Additionally, the context of a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell) and mixed Q1 earnings results contribute to a bearish outlook.

However, this is a weak positive signal, lacking concrete implications. The previous rounds of predictions, however, present a more comprehensive negative outlook for Apple, driven primarily by concerns around Apple's AI investment strategy relative to its competitors, its Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), unfavorable estimate revisions, underperformance of the stock in the past month, and mixed performance in its Q1 earnings specifically concerning weaknesses in Greater China and Wearables segments. Adding to the negative pressure is news regarding STMicroelectronics forecasting a sales decline due to weak legacy chip demand. The prevailing consensus among earlier model predictions leaned towards a higher probability of stock price decline. While some models initially gave higher probabilities for stock rising, the overall trend shows skepticism and eventual downward adjustments due to the compounding negative signals."

While the lower spending compared to competitors could be interpreted positively as fiscally responsible, it also risks portraying Apple as lagging in the rapidly developing AI field. DeepSeek's validation of Apple's approach offers some support but doesn't fully mitigate the competitive pressure from significant AI investments by competitors like Meta.  The Q1 earnings beat is a positive factor, but this is tempered by the Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) rating, underperformance in certain segments (Greater China and Wearables), and the mention of a supplier, STMicroelectronics, forecasting a sales decline.  The majority of previous model predictions lean towards a higher probability of a stock price fall, ranging from 0.45 to 0.7. This consistent negative sentiment, coupled with the mixed signals from the news and the overall market context, leads to a prediction heavily weighted toward a price decrease.  However, Apple's strong brand and generally robust performance prevent the probability of a fall from being extremely high."

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%.

The company's performance is better than anticipated, which typically leads to positive market reactions. However, the recent Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and the unfavorable trend in estimate revisions suggest caution. Additionally, the stock has underperformed the market since the beginning of the year. The overall market sentiment, mixed results across different regions and segments, along with the current bearish rating, contribute to a cautious outlook. Despite the positive earnings surprise, these factors suggest a balanced outlook."

While Apple is a mature company, the continued growth of its installed base (reaching 2.35 billion users) indicates strong customer loyalty and potential for future growth. The statement about Apple attracting new customers suggests that it's not just reliant on existing users upgrading. Additionally, the article points out opportunities for cross-selling within the Apple ecosystem (iPhone owners potentially buying other Apple products like Macs, iPads, or Watches). This indicates revenue growth potential in the long term. I, therefore, estimate a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling in the short term, based solely on this piece of news."

This is a significant factor as iPhones are a major revenue driver.  The immediate post-earnings market reaction (stock rose in extended trading) suggests a positive initial response, likely because the beat on earnings was considered more important than the iPhone sales decline by investors at that moment. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales remains uncertain and could weigh on the stock price over time. Therefore, while there's a higher probability of a short-term price rise due to the positive earnings beat, the longer-term outlook is less clear, leading to a higher probability of price fluctuation."

While positive earnings surprises can lead to short-term price increases, the mixed sentiment regarding future growth prospects, particularly relating to iPhone demand and overall industry outlook, introduces significant caution.

                                    "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.40 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.36 per share. This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to earnings of $2.18 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 1.69%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.49 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.64, delivering a surprise of 10.07%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Micro Computers industry, posted revenues of $124.3 billion for the quarter ended December 2024, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.24%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $119.58 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 2.7%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to underperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.65 on $94.97 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $7.34 on $410.19 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Micro Computers is currently in the bottom 28% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nOne other stock from the same industry, Dell Technologies (DELL), is yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2025. The results are expected to be released on February 26.\n\nThis computer and technology services provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.51 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +14.1%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nDell Technologies' revenues are expected to be $24.66 billion, up 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This is significant as iPhones are a major revenue driver. The initial market reaction was positive (stock rose in extended trading), suggesting investors prioritized the earnings beat. However, the long-term impact of declining iPhone sales is uncertain and could outweigh the positive earnings news.  Analyzing the previous predictions reveals a wide range of opinions, some optimistic due to the earnings beat and Services growth, others pessimistic due to declining iPhone sales and potential supply chain issues (indirectly suggested by STMicroelectronics' news). The consensus leans slightly towards a price rise, but the uncertainty is substantial.  The probability of a price rise is higher in the short-term due to the positive initial market response and earnings beat, but the long-term outlook is less clear.  Considering the mixed nature of the news and the diverse range of predictions among the models, a moderately positive outlook is warranted, with a significant chance of price fluctuation. I've incorporated both the direct news and the evolving consensus from previous model predictions, weighting the short-term positive effects against the longer-term uncertainty related to iPhone sales."

The news regarding a decline in sales from STMicroelectronics, an Apple supplier, further adds to the uncertainty regarding potential supply chain constraints.  Considering the mixed news, the varied previous predictions (with a slight overall leaning towards a price rise), and the potential for both positive (new customer growth, Services strength) and negative (iPhone sales decline, supply chain concerns) factors to influence future performance, I estimate a probability of the stock price rising slightly above 50%, balancing short-term positivity with long-term uncertainty."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 7.90%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, wearables, accessories, and other related products and services. Its operations span across the globe. The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter. Analysts expect 2025 to be a robust year for the company, with a 6% forecasted growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, with more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, Apple Inc., (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an expansive platform for AI services. It is set to reveal several of its new Apple Intelligence features in fiscal 2025 and may explore AI-driven subscription services, which could translate to further revenue potential for the company.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

While this doesn't directly impact Apple's operations, the analysis suggests potential indirect effects. A significant financial shock in Australia, a key market for Apple, could negatively influence consumer spending and investment. Heightened scrutiny and regulatory adjustments could indirectly impact market sentiment. However, Apple is a global company with diversified revenue streams. Therefore, while a major Australian financial crisis could have *some* impact, it's unlikely to cause a dramatic shift in Apple's stock price. The 'Most Read' articles within the news piece relate to Manhattan traffic, Trump's policies, housing aid, and reading scores, none of which directly affect Apple. Similarly, the Businessweek headlines discuss skiing, Trump's backers, Tesla sales, Buc-ee's gas stations, and fertility treatments - all irrelevant to Apple's immediate stock performance.

EPS came in at $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.24% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.36, the EPS surprise was +1.69%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China: $18.51 billion compared to the $22.16 billion average estimate based on two analysts.

The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 7.90%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, wearables, accessories, and other related products and services. Its operations span across the globe. The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter. Analysts expect 2025 to be a robust year for the company, with a 6% forecasted growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, with more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, Apple Inc., (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an expansive platform for AI services. It is set to reveal several of its new Apple Intelligence features in fiscal 2025 and may explore AI-driven subscription services, which could translate to further revenue potential for the company.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

This has an indirect impact on Apple. A significant financial shock in Australia, a key market for Apple, could negatively influence consumer spending and investment. Heightened scrutiny and regulatory adjustments could indirectly impact market sentiment. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams mitigate the risk. Reviewing the previous rounds' predictions, there's broad disagreement on the likely price movement. Some models focus on Apple-specific factors making bullish predictions, while others highlight potentially negative economic factors making relatively bearish predictions. The current article focuses on macroeconomic risks in Australia. Given that there is a risk in Australia that may impact consumer spending and investment, I lean towards a slight downturn, although not a very significant one. Also note that the previous rounds' predictions overall tend to be positive about the stock, so I discount my negative estimation appropriately."

However, the news is limited in scope, focusing only on specific markets and not providing overall sales figures.  Previous predictions show a range of opinions, with some emphasizing the positive correlation between AI software and sales, while others highlight potential risks in various markets and macroeconomic conditions.  The strongest positive predictions were 0.7, and the strongest negative 0.65, implying the overall sentiment is still moderately positive but with significant uncertainties. Considering the positive news coupled with the range of previous predictions, a moderate probability increase is predicted. However, the lack of comprehensive data prevents a vastly bullish prediction.

This suggests strong market penetration and potential for further growth by cross-selling other Apple products like Mac, iPad, or Watch. Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. The probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a rise probability between 0.55 and 0.7. The consensus suggests a bullish outlook, albeit with some caution due to the company's maturity and potential market uncertainties."

EPS came in at $2.40, compared to $2.18 in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe reported revenue represents a surprise of +0.24% over the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $124 billion. With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.36, the EPS surprise was +1.69%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China: $18.51 billion compared to the $22.16 billion average estimate based on two analysts.

While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term. The previous predictions from various models show varying degrees of bullish and bearish sentiments, but the declining revenue in Greater China and the current Zacks rank seem to outweigh the positive earnings surprises."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 7.90%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, wearables, accessories, and other related products and services. Its operations span across the globe. The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter. Analysts expect 2025 to be a robust year for the company, with a 6% forecasted growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, with more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, Apple Inc., (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an expansive platform for AI services. It is set to reveal several of its new Apple Intelligence features in fiscal 2025 and may explore AI-driven subscription services, which could translate to further revenue potential for the company.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

This is unlikely to have a direct immediate impact on Apple's stock price, although Australia is a market for Apple. However, a broader financial crisis triggered by the risks RBA is dealing with may have a negative influence on consumer spending and overall market sentiment, indirectly impacting Apple. Most previous rounds' predictions are related to different news headlines and contexts, with diverse outlooks. Given the indirect and mild nature of the risk arising from the RBA scrutiny and the generally positive sentiment shown by previous rounds' analysis, the probability of a stock price fall is slightly higher than the rise, but not by much. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign a slightly higher probability to stock price falling."

This suggests a positive correlation between the AI software and product demand, a bullish signal. However, the news is limited in scope, focusing only on specific markets and not providing overall sales figures.  Previous predictions are mixed, reflecting uncertainty. Some models focus on the positive correlation between AI and sales, while others highlight potential risks in various markets and macroeconomic conditions.  The range of previous predictions (0.3 to 0.7 for probability of rise) indicates significant uncertainty.  Considering the positive news and the range of previous predictions, a moderate probability of a rise is predicted, acknowledging the lack of comprehensive data and the mixed signals from previous analyses. I'm weighting the positive news more heavily given that it is directly related to Apple's product performance, but I am acknowledging the uncertainty by not giving a high probability.  The overall sentiment from previous rounds leans slightly bullish, so I will not drastically deviate from that, but I remain cautiously optimistic."

This suggests strong market penetration and potential for further growth by cross-selling other Apple products like Mac, iPad, or Watch. Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. The probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a rise probability between 0.55 and 0.7. The consensus suggests a bullish outlook, albeit with some caution due to the company's maturity and potential market uncertainties."

With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.36, the EPS surprise was +1.69%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China: $18.51 billion compared to the $22.16 billion average estimate based on two analysts.

While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term. The previous predictions from various models show varying degrees of bullish and bearish sentiments, but the declining revenue in Greater China and the current Zacks rank seem to outweigh the positive earnings surprises."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 7.90%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, wearables, accessories, and other related products and services. Its operations span across the globe. The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter. Analysts expect 2025 to be a robust year for the company, with a 6% forecasted growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, with more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, Apple Inc., (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an expansive platform for AI services. It is set to reveal several of its new Apple Intelligence features in fiscal 2025 and may explore AI-driven subscription services, which could translate to further revenue potential for the company.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

Although there are risks such as possible government initiatives and tariffs, the bullish sentiment from multiple analyses strengthens the case for a rise in stock price.

He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

The range of previous probabilities of a price rise is wide (0.3 to 0.7).  Considering the positive news and the range of previous predictions, I'm assigning a moderate probability of a price rise.

This suggests strong market penetration and potential for further growth by cross-selling other Apple products like Mac, iPad, or Watch. Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. The probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a rise probability between 0.55 and 0.7. The consensus suggests a bullish outlook, albeit with some caution due to the company's maturity and potential market uncertainties."

This strategy could lead to increased revenue and growth opportunities, potentially positively impacting the stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, most of which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, and taking into account the potential for growth in emerging markets, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling. However, the challenges of expanding into new markets and the lack of concrete numbers or guarantees of success should not be underestimated, which is why I will not assign a very high probability to the stock price rising."

With the consensus EPS estimate being $2.36, the EPS surprise was +1.69%.\n\nWhile investors scrutinize revenue and earnings changes year-over-year and how they compare with Wall Street expectations to determine their next move, some key metrics always offer a more accurate picture of a company's financial health.\n\nAs these metrics influence top- and bottom-line performance, comparing them to the year-ago numbers and what analysts estimated helps investors project a stock's price performance more accurately.\n\nHere is how Apple performed in the just reported quarter in terms of the metrics most widely monitored and projected by Wall Street analysts:\n\nGeographic Revenue- Greater China: $18.51 billion compared to the $22.16 billion average estimate based on two analysts.

The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term. The previous predictions from various models show varying degrees of bullish and bearish sentiments, but the declining revenue in Greater China and the current Zacks rank seem to outweigh the positive earnings surprises."

                                    "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best Stocks to Buy in 2025 for Beginners. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against other best beginner stocks to buy in 2025.\n\nStock Market Outlook for 2025\n\nOn December 12, Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors managing partner and head of research, appeared on CNBC to talk about his 2025 playbook. After two years of significant market gains, Lee\u2019s playbook painted an optimistic yet cautious outlook for the stock market in 2025. He anticipated that the S&P 500 would rise to approximately 7,000 by mid-2025 before retreating to around 6,600 by the end of the year. This highlights an overall expected increase of about 8% for the year, consistent with historical averages for stock market returns.\n\nFurthermore, Lee estimated the Earnings Per Share (EPS) for the S&P 500 to be around $260 in 2025, going up to $300 in 2026. These numbers are slightly below the Wall Street consensus estimates, which show an average of around $268 for 2025. Talking about his investment thesis, Lee believed several themes could bring a positive trajectory in the market in 2025. In his own Dickensian version, he predicted a \u201ctale of two halves,\u201d where the first half of 2025 is expected to see strong market performance, with a potential pullback in the second half. The positive first-half performance is attributed to factors such as market-friendly initiatives under President Trump\u2019s administration and Federal Reserve policies. The pullback in the second half of 2025 reflects historical trends after strong consecutive years.\n\nREAD ALSO: 12 Undervalued Defensive Stocks for 2025 and 10 Best Soaps and Cleaning Materials Stocks to Invest In.\n\nMega Cap Companies: Is There Potential?\n\nLee was of the opinion that the small-cap sector may have potential even though it has historically underperformed relative to large-cap stocks. He also talked about mega-cap companies and how they\u2019re leading, mentioning that investors typically reach for these companies when there is even a possibility of risk in the market. In addition, mega-cap stocks are highly sensitive to falling interest rates. Since the tech market is bullish after the December rate cut is in effect, the investment case for megacaps is further strengthening.\n\nHowever, despite an overall positive outlook, Lee acknowledged that several risks may impact market performance. For instance, he was of the view that the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) could potentially lead to reduced government spending and slower economic growth if it is too effective in cutting costs. Furthermore, the implementation of tariffs poses another concern, as tariffs can adversely affect corporate profits and financial conditions. Lee\u2019s pointing out of historical patterns showed that after two years of considerable gains, markets are prone to decline in the latter half of the third year.\n\nStory Continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe sifted through stock screeners, online rankings, and ETFs to compile a list of 40 blue chip companies with a 10-year revenue compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between 7%-15%. We then selected the top 12 stocks most popular among elite hedge funds. We sourced hedge fund data from Insider Monkey\u2019s database. The stocks are sorted in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders that have stakes in them, as of Q3 2024.\n\nWhy do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter\u2019s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) the Best Consumer Electronics Stock to Invest in Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\n10-year Revenue CAGR: 7.90%\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 158\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, manufactures, and sells smartphones, personal computers, wearables, accessories, and other related products and services. Its operations span across the globe. The company\u2019s stock has gained considerable value over the past few years, with its stock price up 262% over the last five years.\n\nThe company is experiencing some turbulence, especially due to its position in China. According to Reuters, Apple Inc.\u2019s (NASDAQ:AAPL) annual shipments declined by 17% in China in fiscal year 2024, with a 25% decline in fiscal Q4 2024 alone. The company now has a 15% market share in China. Despite this setback, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is growing its earnings, primarily due to strength in its services segment. It posted a revenue of $94.9 billion in fiscal Q4 2024, reflecting a 6% increase compared to last year\u2019s quarter. Analysts expect 2025 to be a robust year for the company, with a 6% forecasted growth rate.\n\nFurthermore, with more than 2.2 billion Apple devices worldwide, Apple Inc., (NASDAQ:AAPL) has an expansive platform for AI services. It is set to reveal several of its new Apple Intelligence features in fiscal 2025 and may explore AI-driven subscription services, which could translate to further revenue potential for the company.\n\nCDT Capital Management stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q4 2024 investor letter:\n\n\u201cThe crowd. While this evolution in AI is going to change the world, market expectations for the technology have become unhinged. The crowd, which is more like an exuberant mob, anointed the Mag 7 with spectacular, nonsensical valuations based on the premise that AI will be an amazing, money-printing growth engine for these companies \u2013 and the truth is it likely will be. The problem is that the math just isn\u2019t mathing.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 3rd on our list of the 12 best stocks to buy in 2025 for beginners. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame.

He reminded the audience that the sector was now worth 150% of the economy\u2019s gross domestic product.\n\nThe RBA is working with regulators to \u201cthink through different scenarios where you could potentially have a multitude of shocks\u201d come together, said Jones, who oversees the financial system at the central bank. The \u201cinterconnectedness in the system is much higher than it was 15 years ago during the global financial crisis.\u201d\n\nThe central bank has previously warned the surging growth of the nation\u2019s pensions industry has created new risks to the stability of the country\u2019s financial system. Potential scenarios could include a large market shock that undermines confidence, an unexpected change in policy settings or a cyber attack, Jones said Thursday.\n\nThose risks were amplified by pension funds \u2014 known as superannuation \u2014 holding far more short-term bank debt than during the global financial crisis, Jones said. Then, they \u201ccollectively owned about 5% of short term bank debt\u201d whereas it now stands at somewhere between 35%-45%, he added.\n\nJones didn\u2019t address the outlook for Australia\u2019s economy or monetary policy during his session.\n\nJones said that the central bank is also looking at the foreign exchange exposures of Australian pension funds, given their growing investment in offshore assets.\n\n\u201cOne is the potential for very large moves in foreign exchange markets to accompany these other market stress events and accelerate or perpetuate the call on liquidity in a stress event,\u201d Jones said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s also the other element of just outside of stress events, the fact that this community here will become almost certainly a larger and larger player in the FX swap market.\u201d\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIndy Pass, the Anti-Vail Seasonal Ski Ticket, Is Gaining Fans What America's Tech Billionaires Really Bought When They Backed Donald Trump Musk Pitches New Narrative as Tesla Sales Fall Forget Factories, Small US Towns Want Buc-ee\u2019s Gas Stations The CDC Won\u2019t Give the Public a Full Picture of Fertility Treatment Risks\n\n\u00a92025 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView Comments",

While a major crisis in the Australian market could indirectly influence consumer spending, the impact on Apple, a global company, would likely be limited. Reviewing the previous rounds of predictions, there's a mix of sentiments based on various news headlines. Those focusing on Apple-specific factors like iPhone sales and AI initiatives are generally bullish, while others emphasizing macroeconomic risks (like China slowdown or Australian financial stability) lean bearish. Given the indirect and mild nature of potential impact of the RBA scrutiny, and considering the divided opinion in the previous rounds, and that most model thinks it has a positive prospect, the probability of a price rise and fall is set around 0.5. However, since most predictions are not as pessimistic, a slight rise prospect are given."

However, the news is limited in scope, focusing only on specific markets and not providing overall sales figures.  Previous predictions are highly varied, reflecting significant uncertainty. Some models emphasize the positive correlation between AI and sales, while others highlight potential risks in various markets and macroeconomic conditions.  The range of previous probabilities of a price rise (from 0.3 to 0.7) indicates significant uncertainty.  Considering the positive news, the range of previous predictions, and the general slight bullish bias across models, I am assigning a moderate probability of a price rise. The lack of comprehensive data and mixed signals prevent a strongly bullish or bearish prediction.  The overall trend from previous rounds is slightly positive, but the uncertainty surrounding this news is considerable."

Such positive growth indicators typically instill investor confidence, leading to a potential rise in stock price. However, as Apple is a mature company, the impact might be moderate rather than dramatic. Previous predictions also lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising, with most models estimating a rise probability between 0.55 and 0.7. The consensus suggests a bullish outlook, albeit with some caution due to the company's maturity and potential market uncertainties. Therefore, the probability of the stock price rising is higher given the positive growth narrative, while the probability of a fall is low as there are no negative indicators in the news."

                                    "reasoning": "The provided news headline 'Apple earnings, Q4 GDP data, home sales: What to Watch' suggests that Apple's upcoming earnings report, along with other significant economic data releases, could impact the stock price. The mixed predictions from previous models reflect uncertainty about the direction of the stock price movement. However, most models agree that Apple's growth prospects, particularly in emerging markets and driven by AI services, are positive indicators. The previous predictions show a range of probabilities for the stock price rising (0.3 to 0.7) and falling (0.3 to 0.7), indicating a high level of uncertainty. Considering the overall positive sentiment from multiple analyses, the potential for growth in emerging markets, and the strong market position of Apple, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling."

This diversification strategy could lead to increased revenue and growth opportunities, potentially positively impacting the stock price. Considering the previous predictions from various models, most of which lean towards a higher probability of the stock price rising than falling, and taking into account the potential for growth in emerging markets, I estimate a slightly higher probability of the stock price rising than falling.

                                    "reasoning": "The financial news indicates mixed results for Apple Inc. (AAPL). While the overall revenue and EPS exceeded analyst expectations, there were notable declines in certain geographic regions, particularly Greater China. The beat on revenue and EPS suggests a positive short-term reaction, but the specific metrics like the decline in Greater China and the mixed performance across product lines could trigger concerns about future growth. Coupled with the current Zacks Rank #4 (Sell), which indicates potential underperformance, these factors suggest that the stock price could be volatile but leans towards a slight downturn in the near term. The previous predictions from various models show varying degrees of bullish and bearish sentiments, but the declining revenue in Greater China and the current Zacks rank seem to outweigh the positive earnings surprises."
